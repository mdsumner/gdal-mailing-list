Subject: [Qgis-developer] python plugin not loaded from PYTHONPATH

I remember I could load plugins from custom paths setting them with
PYTHONPATH but it doesn't work.
I've verified that it's correctly set inspecting os.environ inside the
Python console.
Has something changed or do I miss something?

okey this is really confusing i dont know if am in the right track i just
need a direction where to start with;
all what am trying to do is loading my own offline tiles into qgis to be
able to zoom in and out pan ..etc instead of implementing everything from
scratch;

so this is all what i have been doing:
1) i converted my geotiff to tiles through gdal2tiles and i got my tiles
which is a set of files, and as i mentioned in my last email this is how my
folder looks like:

= 5 (zoom level 5)
==> 20 (x)
===> 18.png (y)
.
.
.
= 13 (zoom level 13)
==> 5253 (x)
===> 4618.png (y)

now i wanna know if i can load my tiles without using tilecache or
mapserver coz as i said i dont need to view my map as a web based
application;

can u tell me how did you manage to make it work with the following xml
file ?

<GDAL_WMS>
     <Service name="TMS">
         <ServerUrl>file:///mytiles/${z}/${x}/${y}.png</ServerUrl>
     </Service>
     <DataWindow>
         <UpperLeftX>-20037508.34</UpperLeftX>
         <UpperLeftY>20037508.34</UpperLeftY>
         <LowerRightX>20037508.34</LowerRightX>
         <LowerRightY>-20037508.34</LowerRightY>

         <TileLevel>18</TileLevel>
         <TileCountX>1</TileCountX>
         <TileCountY>1</TileCountY>
         <YOrigin>top</YOrigin>
     </DataWindow>

     <Projection>EPSG:900913</Projection>
     <BlockSizeX>256</BlockSizeX>
     <BlockSizeY>256</BlockSizeY>
     <BandsCount>3</BandsCount>
     <Cache />
  </GDAL_WMS>

what configuration did u use to make it work ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server WFS-T integration
Message-ID: <506998C0.1000404@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I need some review for the WFS-T implementation in QGIS-Server.
https://github.com/rldhont/Quantum-GIS/tree/wfs_server_transaction
This branche adds the capability to the QGIS Server to understand 
transaction, adds a way to define which WFS layer can be editable and if 
the administrator authorize insert and delete, adds an enhancements for 
the WFS provider to support WFS-T which needs extra parameters.

For the configuration on the WFS-T part, Update is possible if the layer 
is publish as a WFS layer, Insert is possible only if Update is possible 
and Delete is possible only if Insert is possible. You can check Delete 
on a layer and it's automatically a WFS layer, or uncheck Publied on a 
layer and all the checkbox are unchecked.

I have testing QGIS-Server transaction with an ESRI ShapeFile and a 
Spatialite database. The both doesn't return a good FID, but only 
Spatialite has persistent FID. The Spatialite provider probably needs an 
update.
I test my QGIS-Server with QGIS and some JavaScript code.

Message-ID: <CAA6k8-+gUSdvV0-ZGDCyR-RAYGnefTD=pTN7TJ95t-Pun2i9jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,
after my last commit the qgis_rendererstest fails...

I've done a change [1] in qgsmaplayer.cpp to pass the QML files
created with older QGis versions to the the QgsProjectFileTransform
to be processed before loading, like it was done for qgs files.

Before the change only the qgs files was processed.

For this reason I suppose the QML files used in tests have
something wrong, maybe the version store into the file.

In fact if I comment the content of the function
QgsProjectFileTransform::transform0100to0110()
that test passes.

How can I fix it?

I think we should fix those QML files, otherwise increment
their version to 0.11.0.

Regards.

Hi all (and Martin Dobias),

I have supplied a patch for the #2781 issue
Relative paths to SvgMarker doesn't work in new symbology
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/2781

I have testing it, if the relative path is activated in the project, the 
SvgMarker path is also relative.

I can push it, but I can't close the issue, or Matin Dobias can do it.

Apparently you are not using OSGeo4W's sip and PyQt.
That should be sip 4.12.1 and PyQt4 4.8.3.

Such result is produced when SEXTANTE can not find R executable (Not in

SEXTANTE should not be so gullible. It is not so easy for Windows user 
to find out the correct R path.

Hi J?rgen,
you are right. The problem happened because I started cmake from windows
start menu->all programs->cmake 2.8 and not from the OSGeo command shell. 
Now I get:
- Found SIP version: 4.13.1
- Found PyQt4 version: 4.8.3
And I'm able to successful compile qgis.

BTW:
I've never understood how to use the python interpreter and qt installed
with OSGeo to write my plugins since that when I need to install third-party
python libs with PIP, it fails because pip looks for python interpreter in
the standard directory like c:\python27

Thank you.
Massimo

VSI* functions were used in QgsRasterLayer until GDAL was separated
into a provider. Unfortunately copying pieces of code, the functions
have spread around.
My opinion is that those functions should only be used in GDAL
provider if at all.

That is probably my TODO and I meant: consider to add VSIMalloc()
equivalent in QGIS core and use it instead of VSIMalloc.

Let us remove VSIMalloc()/VSIFree() completely if it may be so
dangerous. malloc()/free() for now and a possibility to implement
something similar in QGIS.

In theory, somebody may want to implement some really thin client with
WMS only, without GDAL. Consider also Python bindings, readBlock()
should be /Factory/, it will be released by Python GC.

Dear QGIS list,

Finally, we have managed to put together a WEB site and download option for ENKI.

ENKI is a software framework for building and running environmental models; motivated by, but not restricted to distributed hydrological models. Within ENKI, you can assemble a model from a set of subroutines, which are separately built as dll plugins. ENKI comes with a selection of these dlls, and developers can easily add new ones to their library. 

The address is www.opensource-enki.org, and the download area is at a Google Disk page:
https://drive.google.com/?authuser=0#folders/0B3AI0j0BFI0-blBTSmM3U1JPMlU

You need to log in using a Google account.
ENKI is developed by SINTEF Energy Research, paid by Statkraft; and it is released under LGPL.

Our experience with running OS projects and the associated WEB infrastructure is highly limited, so please have patience...

Best regards,
Sjur Kolberg, SINTEF Energy Research
Oddbj?rn Bruland, Statkraft

Dear Massimo,

I am using ERIC4 for python project management. Connenct nicely with Qt as
well, and all works fine with QGIS 1.8 in Windows.
Good Luck,

Petros Apotsos

Dear Mr. Kolberg,

does the toolkit have polyline representations?

Also, does it have scalar map visualizations?

Thanks

Too bad - no way of overcoming this limitation?
All the best.

Jose,

That'll be two no...

At present, ENKI handles three types of data; rasters, networks (point covers), and scalars (all-region single values). It is possible to represent different types of data using a network. I regularly represent catchments by their outlet gauge stations or their centroids. 

I have thought of extending the list of data types, but so far the need hasn't been strong enough to defend the burden. I have also thought of replacing ENKI's internally defined data types, with data types from QGIS or GDAL/OGR, but I need (to avoid massive rewriting) all data types to be subclasses of a common GIS data set class. AFAIK, that is not the case in QGIS or GDAL/OGR (but I think it is in SAGA). 

Visualisation: ENKI is presently completely without any display of maps or graphs, this is simply a class of functionality that so far has been postponed. For now, this is why I'd like to see ENKI linked up to an OS GIS like QGIS, but for future development, I'll be happy to see at least the most common plotting routines as ENKI internals.

Another reason for postponing graphics is that ENKI's GUI is MFC-based. I'd like to switch to an platform-independent OS GUI library before putting a lot of effort into map and graph visualisation.
 
Sjur  :-)

can't you use directly QGIS for data display?

Paolo,

Sure QGIS could do the visualisation, probably even by function calls with data in memory, not having to export GIS data sets to disk for every time step.

But Statkraft released ENKI under LGPL for a reason. Linking ENKI too closely with GPL QGIS will make ENKI unavailable for the commercial software sector. That would be bad news for the hydropower industry I hope will continue supporting ENKI development. From what I see now, there will still be a need to maintain ENKI as a standalone program, in addition to making the EnkiAPI core available for a QGIS plugin. 

All the best,

Sjur  :-)

I understand this very well, and that's where sextante comes in handy: no linking
there, it's just python (sextante) calling the executable.
So, no prolem in keeping it LGPL.
Of course, if one needs an LGPL or proprietary visualizator, that's a different
story, but should be mainly a packaging problem (keeping the GUI and the backend
separated).
Hope this helps.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New plugin: Edge Densifier
Message-ID: <CAP13dT0wkOghn5964BLLHuP4E1o-BYWm_onMxLo7opZ5K0Ue9Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

Some times you need polygons with denser edges. Your map looks fine in
the 2D environment of QGis but when you need to convert your polygons
to 3D meshes so they can be shown in the globe, long lines should be
converted in arcs. A practical solution is just to add more vertices
to long lines in 2D.

You can use it by editing a polygon layer. I will appreciate any comment.

It works with a dialog for which you have to know in advance the
feature id and vertex index. I'd like to improve it in a way that if
you are using the Node Tool, when you select a vertex, my plugin's
dialog updates those inputs. Any idea?

Another solution I would like is an automatic polygon densifier which
add vertices depending on the length of the edges, not fixed like the
current FTools densify.

You can get the plugin from here until it is approved in the main repository.

Thanks in advance for any hint.

Hi Ren?-Luc

Thank you for this nice addition, WFS-T will certainly be a great 
contribution to QGIS server!

I tried to compile the wfs_server_transaction branch, but it fails with 
the following error message (QGS_NAMESPACE and OGC_NAMESPACE are not 
defined):

/home/marco/src/Quantum-GIS/src/mapserver/qgswfsserver.cpp:718:35: 
Fehler: ?QGS_NAMESPACE? wurde in diesem G?ltigkeitsbereich nicht definiert
/home/marco/src/Quantum-GIS/src/mapserver/qgswfsserver.cpp:721:39: 
Fehler: ?OGC_NAMESPACE? wurde in diesem G?ltigkeitsbereich nicht definiert


Maybe there is a commit that you did not push to github yet?

Then, looking at qgswfsserver.cpp, it seems that most of the 2000 code 
lines deal with GML. It would be good to separate that into a GML 
handling class on its own (which could also be used from qgswfsprovider, 
at the moment, the gml reading seems to be duplicated).

In QgsPostRequestHandler, the code looks for the environment variable 
QUERY_STRING. I thought QUERY_STRING is only defined in http get 
requests and in post requests, there is only CONTENT_LENGTH ?

Which WFS client did you use for testing (QGIS desktop)?

Regards,
Marco

Hi Marco,

I updated my branch with the definition of QGS_NAMESPACE and OGC_NAMESPACE.

For the GML, I'll update QgsGeometry class ?

For Query_String, I found the code with a google search.

I test WFS-T with a jQuery XML POST and with QGIS.

Cheers,

Hi Ren?-Luc

 >For the GML, I'll update QgsGeometry class ?

Yes, it will be good to have everything in one place (also for a 
potential redesign of QgsGeometry). But the GML methods should not be 
exported to the bindings, maybe you could add a comment in that 
direction to qgsgeometry.h.

Marco

Hi

The problem I have with changing / fixing the files is that they
represent 'valid' (from user point of view) qml files that a user may
have created so if they no longer render correctly in our tests, the
user is going to get a bad experience when they install QGIS 2.0 and
try to use it with their old qml definitions.

So we need to decide 'do we care about that'? I think we probably should.

Regards

Tim

I think it is realistic to guarantee backwards projects and styles
compatibility for the last 3 or 4 version, keeping them all will become
an useless burden.
All the best.

Hi Marco,

I updated the QgsGeometry Class to add :
* fromGML2 static method
* exportToGML2 method

If you want to test QGIS Server Transaction you need to use the QGIS of 
my branch, because I update the WFS provider to POST transaction with a 
query_string (in the case of QGIS Server the map parameter).

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Message-ID: <CA+3oMjtw-rQHnAhE=Vv1M7v=WUhDAxJn7=OJb7YfQ-MO79RO3w@mail.gmail.com>

Dear developers,

A long outstanding issue is (which is probably preventing QGIS from
being integrated into the "main" debian repository and the fedora
repository) that there are a lot of files inside our source tree that
have no or an unknown license with no copyright and so on ..

I took the freedom to make a short list and sort out all file which
have no license header ..

All in all I found 516 files without any license!
And bad news for Victor and sextante - 275 of them are in the sextante
subdirectories ;)

I encourage and kindly ask all developers who committed this files to
add a proper header to those files to get a bit closer of being
adopted into the main repositories of the big Linux distributions (not
to forget that having a copyright and license in the files is anyway a
good thing to have)

Find attached the list of the files (or if it does not go through the
server you can find the file in [1])

If you need any help drop me a note
thanks for your help

kind regards
Werner

Hi Werner,

but which license we should put in files? As I can see there is one open
ticket [0] and one closed [1] and both about GPL v3(+?). But in other hand,
most QGIS source files still contain reference to GPL v2+

Not bad news...as long as I can find a way to automate adding those headers :-)

I used to keep a license file in the head folder, and no license
headers in individual files. I guess this should have been considered
before moving the SEXTANTE code into the QGIS repo...

I will add the header and commit it. Suggestions if anyone has done
something like that before are welcome.


Thanks


Victor

Hi Alexander

Well - the person who has written the files can choose ;)
So just select a license which is expropriate to what you want
(preferably a Open Source License) .. ;)

To my knowledge the thing with GPLv2 vs GPLv3 is just that we still have
some files that have GPL2 _ONLY_ and not GPLv2 or later .. which makes
it a bit difficult ..
But I think most important thing for now is that every file HAS a
license ..

If you prefer GPL v2+ or GPL v3 or even BSD .. as long as it is open
source it does not matter.
So that we can say _whole_ QGIS is opensource ..

If you don't know which license to choose you can find some suggestions
in [1] and [2].
As a help for choosing the "correct" one I think that matrix at [3]
helps a lot ..

Just let every file have it's license from the creator/committer.. If
there will be some problems left - we can easily sort it out when we
have this big part ready ..

thanks a lot

P.S:

I guess the prefered license for any future files committed to QGIS
would be

GPL v3+

So if you don't see any problem releasing your file with that license it
is good to go with it ..

We are currently testing Cubewerx web services and are interested in testing their WCS support. Can QGIS use a WCS server and if so how can I use it to do that?

Also is there any WMTS support yet? We are interested in testing this also.

Thanks,

Yes, there is WMTS support.  Just make sure the WMS url contains SERVICE=WMTS
or /WMTSCapabilities.xml.

Bob,

You can also do WCS using the GDAL WCS driver.  I don't know if there
is special support in QGIS for setting up the connection.  If not you
can hand prepare a WCS service description file, and open that.  There
is some information on this at:

  http://www.gdal.org/frmt_wcs.html

Best regards,
Frank

J?rgen,
	When I try and add a URL to the WMS layer definition with a &SERVICE=WMTS parameter it is stripped out. Unfortunately that is the only part of my URL that is the difference with the WMS URL so without the WMTS service specified it defaults to the WMS service. So I haven't been able to get WMTS to work.

Yes, there is WMTS support.  Just make sure the WMS url contains SERVICE=WMTS
or /WMTSCapabilities.xml.

I forgot to mention that I spoke about master.   Did you try with 1.8?

some notes:

At the moment it is possible to have the same group name at the same or
different level in the tree. 
For example the following is a valid legend tree:
-- GroupGisAnalisys1
   |_ layer1
   |_ Layer2
   |_ Group1
      |_Group2
         |_Layer4
      |_Group3
-- GroupGisAnalisys2
   |_ layer1
   |_ Layer2
   |_ Group1
      |_Group2
         |_Layer4
      |_Group3

How can be possible to have direct access to a group by name?

For example:
legend =  qgis.utils.iface.legendInterface()
groupIndex = legend.groupIndex('group1')  [a shortcut for
legend.groups().indexOf (.....)]

will always return the index of the first group in the tree.

Even the groupLayerRelationship does not help too much.

I think that the best way to solve this problem is to give full access to
the legend tree in terms of QgsLegendItem(s) and avoid to put some logic
into the legendInterface. Each plugin will implement his own business logic.

At the moment QgsLegendItem is not exposed to python API and I'm not so
skilled to do it.

I tried to add the following function to qgslegendinterface and implement
it:
virtual QgsLegendItem * firstItem() = 0;
but I'm in trouble with sip binding because QgsLegendItem is not exposed in
sip.

Does anybody think that this make sense?
If yes, Can I expect that anybody will implement such behavior or will help
me to do that in the short term?

Any comment will be appreciated.

Massimo

Hi,

I know that there can be two or more layers of the same name, but I
think we can solve it in different ways:

1. the method providing access to layers by name could return a list /
array with layer references - if the plugin author knows/assumes that
the layer names in his project are distinct he can just pick up the
first reference in the list

* we could improve the method by allowing to specify a search path /
layer hierarchy, so the plugin author could filter the whole tree to a
subset - but the method would also return a list like in the other
solution above

The current way to access the legend tree is complicated and not
developer friendly - and currently it is buggy (returns the wrong index).

Hi all,
sorry to bother again about this. I know it's a stupid and minor issue,
but it does not look good for users, and causes a lot of puzzling and
frustration. It is very easy to fix, just copypasta: any volunteer, here
at the HF of away?
Thanks.

WCS support is available in master. If you compile QGIS with
CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE = Debug on Linux, you can also use qgis_wcstest
application to run automatic test on your server. For example:

qgis_wcstest --server http://my.server.org/mywcsservice --num 10
--version 1.0.0 --force  ./mycachedir

it also tests the same coverages via GDAL provider for comparison. The
report is written in ./mycachedir/index.html

You may still find some issues, please let me know if you find any problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] License Summary
Message-ID: <506D673B.1070705@gmail.com>

Hi!

I took the freedom to dig a bit deeper into what is in our sourcecode..
Licenses we have so far:

1475 Files: GPL (v2 or later)

508 Files: (*No copyright* ) UNKNOW -> We should definitely fix this!!

41 Files: GPL (v3 or later) (sqlanywhere and pal) -> Issues? Do we have
to switch do v3?
21 Files: zlib/libpng
18 Files: LGPL
6 Files: MPL (v1.1) GPL (unversioned/unknown version)
6 Files: MIT/X11 (BSD like)
4 Files: (*No copyright*) GENERATED FILE
2 Files: BSD (3 clause)
1 File: *No copyright* Public domain

So once we have cleaned those 508 Files with UNKNOWN we can decide under
which license the "QGIS" has to be (GPL v2+? GPL v3+)
There is also the possibility that some of the UNKNOWN do have a
copyright and these things do have a "wrong" header which is not caught

Thanks!

The java SEXTNATE code is MIT licensed, but I think that someone said
that QGIS plugins should be GPL. I am fine with both GPL 2 and 3, in
case you can add the headers yourself (thanks in advance!).

Alexander and Camilo contributed code as well. Do they have anything
to say about this?

Regards

Victor

Thanks Werner for the analysis. So we have two issues:
- missing copyrights (can we have a list of those files?)
- compatibility among licences and licence of the resulting final product.
For the first one, enquiring the original author(s) and applying what
they ant should be enough (I think our coding standard, we all promised
to abide to, already ask for GPL, am I right?).
For the second, I think it would be good to ask for advice, e.g. from
FSF legal offices.
Opinions?

Hi,

Layer or groups ?
Finding a layer in the legend is always possible even if there are another
layer with the same name using legend.layers() that returns QList<
QgsMapLayer * >  and then is up to you to distinguish the layer.


Andreas Neumann wrote

> developer friendly - ....

Programmatically move a layer to a specified groups is not a common scenario
but if you have to do that and you have nested groups there should be a way
to uniquely index a group.
Programmatically traversing the legend tree and keep track of its parent
group is not a common scenario too and groupLayerRelationship can not help
when there are groups with the same name.


Andreas Neumann wrote
>  ....- and currently it is buggy (returns the wrong index). 

I don't want to be annoying but please consider the following simple legend
example:

- Layer1
- Group1
- Group2
--- NestedGroup3
- Group4 

Suppose you want to use your test to move Layer1 in NestedGroup3
Your test code will fail and any other test will fail because
self.legend.moveLayer in QGis 1.7 and 1.8 considers only top level group.

I've introduced a different group indexing in 1.9 that is consistent with
legend.groups() indexing.
Now the same legend tree is indexed in the following manner:
- Layer1
- Group1   [groupIndex=0]
- Group2   [groupIndex=1]
--- NestedGroup3    [groupIndex=2]
- Group4   [groupIndex=3]

that is consistent with the list returned by legend.groups() and give a
consistent meaning to the groupIndex parameter used in the API
documentation.

I'm sorry for this drawback and I'm ready to contribute to a common solution
that accommodates all the needs.

In my case I need to :
- load a third-party "workspace" file with a tree of groups and layers.
- write a third-party "workspace" file with a tree of groups and layers
starting from a qgis legend

The main goal of the plugin I'm writing is to substitute a commercial
solution (viewer + plugin) that is obsolete and expensive to maintain that
is actually used by an Italian public administration.

Massimo

I don't see why sextante in qgis has to change from MIT to GPL, does
it really have to?

Or is it a policy that all new code in qgis be GPL2/GPL3/LGPL?

Is there any official guideline on requirements and exact version number?

No, it does not have to, from a legal point of view.

Hi all,

In Lizmap plugin, I need to display the layer and group tree. You can find
some code here :
https://bitbucket.org/mdouchin/lizmapplugin/src/9cdfa856b8f0/lizmap.py
Line 451 : populateLayerTree

There is some specific lizmap code in there, but you can probably use some
of it.

I do not think it has changed: java and python versions have no code in
common, so the author simply chose a different licence.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue with WFS Provider .so linkage
Message-ID: <506D8EBB.7080702@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Because of some changes in the QgsGeometry class with the QGIS Server 
WFS-T integration, I would like to update the WFS Provider.

I update it and I test it. The result is a segfault because of a 
undefined symbol.

I verifying the linkage between my 
build/lib/qgis/plugins/libwfsprovider.so and libqgis-core.so. I thought 
it is linked to my build/lib/libqgis_core.so unfortunatly it is linked 
to the installed libqgis_core /usr/lib/libqgis_core.so

There is an option for the compilation to force the linkage of plugins 
to the building libqgis_core ?

Thanks,

Ren?-Luc

Have you rebuilt the entire source tree or just the provider?

QGIS Gains a Gold Sponsor

The Quantum GIS (QGIS) project is happy to announce that the Asia Air Survey Co., Ltd (AAS), a Japanese international consulting company, has become a Gold Sponsor. AAS has committed to providing 9,000 EUR (~ $11,000 US) each of three years, beginning in November 2012. 

The AAS sponsorship is yet another indication that QGIS is a mature and stable project which continues to provide innovative open source GIS software. 

The QGIS Project Steering Committee (PSC) wishes to thank AAS for their continuing commitment. These funds will help further the development of QGIS, in part by allowing face to face developer meetings and code sprints (also known as hackfests).

The QGIS project has always relied on volunteers and community involvement. If your organization would like to become a sponsor, please contact the Finances and Marketing Manager: cavallini[at]faunalia.it. For more information on sponsorship levels, please see the QGIS Sponsorship page (http://www.qgis.org/en/sponsorship.html).

Michael,

thank you for the tip but your code fails under some circumstances. See
attached image.
<http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/file/n5006430/lizmap_error.png> 

If you think that you can fix it I will be happy to adopt your algorithm,
otherwise we can find a solution adding something to QGis API.

Just to make clear. I prefer the MIT license in the case of the Java
version, as it is meant to be used in many different apps (it is a
library). I the python case, it is just a QGIS plugin, so I do not see
much difference and i am happy with GPL as well. I think is a better
idea, so as to have a homogeneous licensing across QGIS code.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS python plugin, segmentation fault,
	what can I do?
Message-ID: <506D97AB.8040402@venus.uni-freiburg.de>

Hello,

I'm trying to write a python plugin to create an input file for an urban 
climate model (RayMan) out of three shape files.
Unfortunatelly QGIS closes when I try to load the plugin (Windows, as 
well as Linux, both 32bit, version 1.8.0). When I start QGIS from the 
Terminal (Ubuntu), I get "segmentation fault" when it happens. Thats all.
Is there some function that is known to crash QGIS or do you have any 
suggestions how I could  track down the error?

I put the plugin on our server if that helps. It can be downloaded from 
http://www.urbanclimate.net/shp_to_obs.zip.

Best regards!

Dominik Froehlich

Hi massimo,

You are right, we must add a id for each group in Qgis. For now, the group
is defined only with its name, which leads to this kind of behaviour. At
the contrary, layers do have an id in Qgis, so you can use the same name
for 2 different layers.

I think we must enhance a bit the way how groups are handled and provide
appropriate public methods like
group->id(), ?etGroup(id), etc.

In the lizmap example, I could only use  QgsLegendInterface::groups  wich
returns a string list of groups, and groupLayerRelationship which provide a
flat list of groups and layers. The latter returns ids of layers, but name
of groups, so there is no easy way to distinguish to groups with the same
name.

Michael

Michael,

the group Id could be the groupIndex. For example:
GroupA                               [groupIndex=0, itemIndex = 0]
	Layer1                        [groupIndex=0, itemIndex = 1]
	GroupB                       [groupIndex=1, itemIndex = 2]
		GroupC               [groupIndex=2, itemIndex = 3]
			Layer2       [groupIndex=2, itemIndex = 4]
	GroupA                       [groupIndex=3, itemIndex = 5]
GroupB                               [groupIndex=4, itemIndex = 6]
	GroupC                       [groupIndex=5, itemIndex = 7]
		Layer3                [groupIndex=5, itemIndex = 8]

In this way you obtain: 
- the groupIndex correspond to legend.layers() list
['0.GroupA','1.GroupB','2.GroupC','3.GroupA','4.GroupB','5.GroupC']
- you can use the groupLayerRelationship to reconstruct the exact hierarchy
in the same way you are doing now

But, from my point of view, this is like a patch to a fragile system. 
It would be much more useful to expose a property to access the legend items
in terms of QgsAppLegendItem.

The QgsAppLegendItem should be a sort of QgsLegendItem
(src\app\legend\qgslegenditem.h) that expose the following
 - type (layer or group)
 - parent (QgsAppLegendItem)
 - children (list of QgsAppLegendItem)
 - expanded
 - visible

Once you have an item you can do all your business logic.

Please let me know your opinion.

Regard 
Massimo

Hi massimo

I completely agree, and would like to avoid the "patch to a fragile system"
you mentionned.

Having the QgsAppLegendItem with properties and methods like you described
it the right way to go IMHO.
The children property will help to re-build the hierarchical tree (instead
of using my algo based on the flat object returned by
groupLayerRelationship, a bit hard to read and understand.).

So + 1 for me :)

While it woulf be good to expose legend api to python, it mught be a
lot of work.

would it be sufficient to have the following?

1) groups relations like this:
QList< QPair< int, QList < int > > >

2) layers within a group like this:
QList< QPair< int, QList< QString > > >
or
QList< QPair< int, QList< QgsMapLayer* > > >

this way, you have access to group hierarchies by id, and layers for each group.

You would use existing methods like setGroupExpanded() to work on
groups in a relatively simple manner.

kimaidou:

which objects are you referring to here?
group->id(), ?etGroup(id), etc.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Outcome of the finance and marketing report
Message-ID: <506DCAD8.4060505@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I try to consolidate the main conclusions of our discussion:
- companies listed in [0] will be requested to provide evidence of their
involvement with QGIS, and major facts will be listed in the page, to
provide a fair way for users to assess their contribution to the project
- we agree to start protecting our trademark, based on the guidelines in
[1], possibly others
- QGIS Swiss User Group will prepare a package "Build a QGIS User Group
in your country", in order to stimulate the birth of more communities,
and have financial support from them
- we agreed in started dealing with targeted donations, upon initiative
of QGIS community (not on request from users), using one of the many
services available; we ask our users and devs to help us finding the
best  of the bunch and more suitable for our purposes
- we agree reviving the course certification/participation initiative,
at least for basic participation certificates.
Am I forgetting something?
All the best.

FYI

I have created a QGIS plugin "Tile Index Viewer" (in the official
plugin repos, still marked as experimental)

This plugin can show a raster preview of the tiles on the canvas, and
also load rasters from selected tiles

1) using contextual menu on the map canvas
2) using theTileIndex plugin menu
3) setting the style of the layer to "TileIndex renderer"

cheers

the problem [1] is confirmed: it's present in all the QGis
installations that uses packages, both self-compiled or
from repository (nightly).

The issue is due to the current location of the console icons
in the QGis source tree.

I discussed together with Tim about the better way to fix it,
we agree that console icons and help should be moved in
the proper folders, i.e. respectively images and resources
located in the source root.

Salvatore, please could you fix it making a such change?
Thanks.

Regards.

thanks for this - shouldn't this be added to documentation, in the new

you can move the iconConsole folder to
/images/theme/default/consoleicons

and the helpConsole folder to
/resources/console_help

In you code you can get an icon by using
QgsApplication.getThemeIcon( "/consoleicons/myicon.png" )
which also takes care the theme.

To get the location of the help files use instead
QgsApplication.pkgDataPath() + "/resources/console_help/";

Hi Dominik,

Please check line 30 in shp_to_obs.py,
  QtCore.QObject.connect(self.Next, QtCore.SIGNAL("clicked()"), 
shp_to_obs.Next)

ShowDialog1 class doesn't know shp_to_obs instance.

Yes it could be a lot of work and I'm not sure about how to do it.

Using the index instead of group name is a good idea. Anyway, the groups
relations could be recursive in order to avoid a "complex" algorithm to
reconstruct the hierarchy.
Furthermore splitting the information over two lists cuts off the exact
sequence of layers/groups and any post processing logic will fail to
reconstruct  the hierarchy.

Thus I propose another solution based on QDomDocument similar to the one
adopted into the QgsLegend::writeProject method.
The returned document will contain only groups and layers names and indexes,
like the following example:
<!DOCTYPE Group Layer Hierarchy>
<Legend>
 <Group Name="G0" Index="0">
  <Layer GroupIndex="0" Id="L020120904162647883" Name="L0" Index="0"/>
  <Group Name="G1" Index="1">
   <Group Name="G2" Index="2">
    <Layer GroupIndex="2" Id="L120120904162647883" Name="L1" Index="1"/>
    <Layer GroupIndex="2" Id="L220120904162647382" Name="L2" Index="2"/>
    <Layer GroupIndex="2" Id="L320120904162644097" Name="L3" Index="3"/>
   </Group>
   <Group Name="G3" Index="3">
    <Layer GroupIndex="3" Id="L40120904162648624" Name="L4" Index="4"/>
   </Group>
   <Group Name="G4" Index="4">
    <Layer GroupIndex="4" Id="L520120904162649445" Name="L5" Index="5"/>
   </Group>
  </Group>
 </Group>
</Legend>

Hi all,

+ 1 for the proposal of Massimo using the DOM implementation. I will be
straightforward to use.

DOM approach would be fine for read-only access... for operations that
change the hierarchy (e.g. create group G5 within group G3, or move
layer L0 to group G4) it would be good to have classes that represent
the legend items, something like this:

class LegendInterface
{
  LegendItem* root(); // return top-level group (virtual)
}

class LegendItem
{
  ItemType type(); // either group or layer
  LegendItem* parent();
  QList<LegendItem*> children();
  int indexInParent();

  QString name();
  bool isExpanded();
  // + operations: rename, expand/collapse
}

class LegendGroup : LegendItem
{
  bool isVisible();
  // + operations: add child group, remove child group, show/hide ...
}

class LegendLayer : LegendItem
{
  QgsMapLayer* layer();
  bool isVisible();
  // + operations: move to different group, show/hide, refresh
symbology items ...
}

Like this we could get rid of much of the awkwardness of legend
interface. What do you think?

Hi

I am not a QGIS user or a QGIS developer (of the C++ variety), I am also not (currently) developing a plugin for the QGIS repository, but I am developing a QGIS plugin in Python that will be used by other QGIS users. Maybe I am missing something, but it seems like there is a niche between the QGIS User and QGIS Developer communities that could have its own community. I know there are good forums like  http://gis.stackexchange.com where Python programmers can get help and this qgis-developer list will often respond to specific questions also, but I am wondering if there is space for a QGIS Python Programmers community?

In my case, if the plugin is a success there could potentially be many new users to QGIS (at least in Ireland) and a version of the plugin could be added to the QGIS repository, possibly as part of the Hydrological Toolbox, so I think there would be a benefit to supporting such a community.

Unfortunately I am not at the Hackfest to promote the idea, but if this starts a discussion, please let me know.

Regards

Ian

Hi Ian,
I would not be in favour of fragmenting too much the community. I am
sure py developers are most welcome in the dev ML.
All the best.

OK, i see how this could fail.

xml stuff is good for export/import but not very handy for
modifications, so this isn't a viable solution

I'll give a -1 on your implementation as it's another stop-gap solution.

I'd support either Martin's solution or exposing the QgsLegend and
related classes to python. But even there,  GroupLayerInfo and
QgsLegend::groupLayerRelationship() have to be modified, or dropped.

cheers
Etienne

Just let me note that exposing QgsLegend is currently not really
possible as it is not (yet) a part of GUI library because there are
some dependencies on other qgis application specific classes that
would need to be removed first. Also, QgsLegend should really be
refactored to use more flexible model/view approach - currently it is
based on QTreeWidget convenience view and that does not fit so well
anymore with the functionality we need.

Hi all.
Plugin tags have been give very liberally:

I cleaned up most obvious mistakes, and I would urge plugin authors to
go and fix the others, removing the very specialized ones, and
correcting pelling UPPER/lowercase, etc.
This will make the tagging system far more useful.
Thanks.

Thanks to the fine script from J?rgen and hist help I can say we are now
down to about

186 Files having in UNKNOWN license out of 2073 files which should have
a license

I've seen there are a some in

GdalTools
db_manager
some in the scripts directory itself
grass
and some in the tests subdirectory

and then there are some which license unfortunately is not getting
recognised by the licensechecker and mistakenly set as "UNKNOWN"

but at least I see a huge progress in having lesser not licensed files
in the source tree ..

if you have time please have a look through your files and add a proper
header

thanks a lot

Werner

We could almost put something on the server side that auto  converts the
tags into lowercase.

Yes, but the main issue is that authors do not stick to general
categories, rather inserting all sorts of very specialized keywords.
I would suggest to use first of all very general keywords (vector,
raster, web, database) and then thematic ones (hydrology, zoology,
forestry, etc.).
Perhaps we should add this to the python uploader howto.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Why is it not possible to extract the z value of a
 wkb geometry with PyQGIS while it is possible with ogr or Shapely ?
Message-ID: <CAOpGmVDQHNGUuQE-isiVkPxQ0jiRCK_ELZ9kaJw0fASBuBwuOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
Why PyQGIS (which use the GEOS library) can not extract the z coordinate of
a 3D object while it recognizes that the WKB geometry is 3D  ?

For example, with a 3D point shapefile:
mylayer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
*mylayer.geometryType() == QGis.Point
True*
select the first object
sel = mylayer.selectedFeatures()[0]
geom = sel.geometry()
*geom.wkbType() == QGis.WKBPoint
False*
*geom.wkbType() == QGis.WKBPoint25D*
*True*
but no z in
*geom.asPoint()
(202586,89818.4)*
dir(geom.asPoint())
['__class__', ..., *'x', 'y*']
str(geom.asPoint().wellKnownText())
'POINT(202585.879480043950024992 89818.376070138576324098)'

*But if I use ogr or Shapely (also using the GEOS library) to treat the
resulting geometry,** no problem with the z value** :*

*With ogr:*
from osgeo import ogr
*wkb = geom.asWkb()*
geom_ogr = ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkb(wkb)
*geom_ogr.GetGeometryType() == ogr.wkbPoint25D
True*
and:
dir(geom_ogr)
['AddGeometry',..., *'GetX', 'GetY', 'GetZ'*, 'Intersect',...]
*geom_ogr.GetX(),geom_ogr.GetY(),geom_ogr.GetZ()
(202585.87948004395, 89818.376070138576, 168.35000610351562)*
geom_ogr.ExportToWkt()
'POINT (202585.879480043950025 89818.376070138576324 168.350006103515625)'

*With Shapely*:
from shapely.wkb import loads
wkb_shap = loads(wkb)
*wkb_shap.has_z
True*
and
dir(wkb_shap)
['__array_interface__',...,'*coords*',...,  'wkt', '*x'*, 'xy', '*y*', '*z*
']
*list(wkb_shap.coords)
[(202585.87948004395, 89818.376070138576, 168.35000610351562)]
wkb_shap.x,wkb_shap.y,wkb_shap.z
(202585.87948004395, 89818.376070138576, 168.35000610351562)*
# but no z in WKT.
wkb_shap.wkt
'POINT (202585.8794800439500250 89818.3760701385763241)'

Therefore, the z value is  present in the geometry obtained with PyQGIS and
it should be possible to to extract the z value. But it is beyond my
skills because
the qgis module is compiled (qgis.so)

Thanks in advance

Because Qgis geometries do not manage z data.

well, that is kind of against the tagging idea. maybe we should have tags
and categories?
for sure devs should check if there is already a similar tag to what they
wqnt to use and try to reuse tags where possible

Perhaps,  but that would allow to use these values ??in Python without using
the other modules, see  visualizing 3D data (Z values) or data with z

Ok, this is what I did so far:

* cleaned all stale tags (tags without a tagged item)
* transformed all tags to lowercase (now it's done automatically)
* trimmed spaces before and after tag strings (now it's done automatically)
* added a new RPC method: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/RPC2/

I'll check the autocomplete on the website, but this would be motstly
unuseful in any case, the tags must be defined inside the metadata in
the zip package, they are not meant to be defined on the website.

	application
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673n+5rx_S=nb9YQWv+5SSRcYbAXJT3in8f_oA4+JYQp2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

during the HF we introduced two new fields in the plugins web
application http://plugins.qgis.org :

* author
* email

this new fields are now mandatory for both the old __init__.py and the
new metadata.txt file.

Temporary documentation can be found at
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/docs/metadata.rst

Having the webiste user (which comes from OSGEO LDAP authentication)
decoupled from the plugin author and email makes now possible to show
a different author and email for each plugin even if uploaded by the
same website user.

All existing plugins author and email, when missing, have beeen
automatically filled using LDAP informations, but all new plugins must
now contain author and email metadata in order to be accepted on the
repository.

These new field must also be changed in the plugin builder, in
particular, the old authorName is now ignored and should be changed
(or maybe better copied ) in "author"

Please note that the __init__.py parser in the web application only
recognize functions returning quoted strings or boolean values.

Hi Ren?-Luc

 >If you want to test QGIS Server Transaction you need to use the QGIS 
of my branch

I'm using the branch wfs_server_transaction from your repo. Adding a WFS 
is possible, but QGIS does not show it as editable (the edit tool is 
grayed out).

Marco

Do you have a wfstlayers element in the QGIS project file ?
In this element I define the WFS-T capabilities. The server uses it to
define the layer capabilities. You can find its in the Query element of
your layer featuretype element.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] cmake variable WITH_GRASS broken?
Message-ID: <CABo5uVtYF=Kiyhcd+Ev64qqQ_iGvKkX2EwwUE4GQcEHHXUYoxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm compiling QGIS without GRASS. So I set cmake variable WITH_GRASS
to OFF. But qgis grass code is still running.

When I start QGIS I get this output:
...
Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 128: (init) GRASS gisBase
from GISBASE env var is:
Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 289: (isValidGrassBaseDir)
isValidGrassBaseDir()
Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 133: (init) GRASS gisBase
from QSettings is:
Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 289: (isValidGrassBaseDir)
isValidGrassBaseDir()
Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 148: (init) GRASS gisBase

Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 289: (isValidGrassBaseDir)
isValidGrassBaseDir()
Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 199: (init) Valid GRASS
gisBase is: /usr/lib64/grass64

Debug: src/providers/grass/qgsgrass.cpp: 237: (init) set PYTHONPATH:
/usr/lib64/grass64/etc/python:
Segmentation fault

This is after make and running QGIS from build/output/bin.

I'm compiling QGIS with latest GDAL so I cannot link to my GRASS
system installation and I don't want to compile GRASS now.

I had similar problem on some other computer with WITH_GRASS set to
OFF. The compilation was broken because it was still linking to grass.
But in this case I thought that it is my problem with some configure
and clean combinations.

Hi Ren?-Luc

Below is the capabilities response I get. There is a transaction element 
in it (so I guess publishing the layer as WFS-T worked). But the WFS 
client in QGIS does not seem to recognize it.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <507054B6.7070809@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Plugin migration towards the new repo is slowly proceeding. Does anybody
have a clever way of knowing which are not yet migrated from the various
repos? If we have a list, it will be far easier to decide how to proceed.
All the best, and thanks.

I'm changing the plugin installer to get author name from
"author" function, but for compatibility it'll check the
"authorName" function whether the author one is missing.

On QGis <= 1.8  the users can still install and use plugins from
the new plugin repository without updating the plugin installer.
The only issue using an old plugin installer could be it doesn't
show the author of plugins which uses the new metadata and
are only locally available (e.g. plugins removed from the repo).

Should we really release a update for a such problem?
I suppose no, but any opinion is welcome.

Regards.

no reply, so let's make it simpler: how can I obtain a clean list (name

Hi P?teris,

we talked about the next hackfest venue (spring 2013) and would now like
to come back to your offer for the next QGIS meeting in Valmiera. Are you
still interested?

If so, we could start to plan the date and organize the meeting.

Regards
Otto

Hi,

I'm cleaning the web app interface and I wonder if we should move the
very few contents of the snippets application to the wiki and shut it
down completely.

The first snippet is just spam http://plugins.qgis.org/snippets/13/ ,
hanging there from two months and nobody nocticed it...

We have had a dozen of snippets submissions in two years, certainly
not an exicitng rate.

Beside that, I think we have better alternatives for posting short
pieces of code, being the wiki the best candidate.

Any comment?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] HF: final remarks
Message-ID: <5071AF8E.3000907@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
This HF is over - only three Italians stranded in Essen, waiting for
their flights back.
I personally want to deeply thank Horst, Otto, and all those who helped
organize this very successful event. The location is simply ideal, no
waste of time, maximum concentration on coding and discussing (OK, apart
from the bad influence of IT Crowd, damned), a beautiful and quiet
place, a friendly atmosphere, and efficient infrastructure.
In my personal opinion, Villa Vogelsang is the best place we've ever
had, and I would suggest coming back here more or less regularly (e.g.
we could have one itinerant HF per year, and another one here).
Another thing I'd like is to make it easier for people from other
continents to participate (we are too Eurocentric at the moment),
without incurring in too high flight costs. Perhaps we could have
simultaneous HFs in each continent, and be constantly connected in audio
and video?
Thanks again to all for contributing to this success, that marks another

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New voting on plugins
Message-ID: <CAL5Q670ozEJabcRhdsirABrYLWXvF=9YT4sznEWhmXvU2vjPqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've implemented a voting system on plugins (1-5 stars), this is open
to anonymous users (they shouldn't be able to vote more than once in
the same browser session), the voting system can now be used to weight
the downloads count and create a more meaningful popularity index.

There is minor bug if you reload the page after voting and vote again
the vote counter is incremented on the web page even if the message
correctly inform you that your vote has been modified (the backend
correctly records only one vote and changes the score accordingly).

Please test it and report bugs on the qgis-django tracker:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django

If we need a RPC webservice to enable voting from QGIS client I can
easily create one.

Hi all,

just found that we have new version in redmine "Version X - Unplanned".
Is there any rules about usage of this version, e.g. when it should be

I suppose for all tickets that we formerly assigned to the latest (or upcoming)
version and constantly needed to move to the next version, when we missed that
version target -which in turn creating artificial noise on the tickets,
which somewhat mask real changes.

So that version should be the default target unless we explicitly plan to fix
something on a specific release.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q6700PV8oUumutixsQ+MwT157X6yD4yhwJ0v-CdBwL01X5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

with the new voting system we have the opportunity to sort the plugins
by popularity, we just need to decide the formula (SQL) to do the
math, this is what we have in each plugin record and can be used for
the SQL math:

* rating_score (sum of all scores)
* rating_votes (number of votes)
* downloads (number of)

the idea is that the number of  download is and index of popularity
but can be biased by how long the plugin has been on the repository,
the woting system should instead be weighted by the number of votes,
the simple average is not probably sufficient.

The score is an integer, ranging 1-5

This is the current quick and dirty scoring algorithm:

 SELECT downloads * (1 + (rating_score/(rating_votes+0.01)/3))

any idea (possibly avoid GROUP BY and SUM or other expensive computations) ?

Most likely you have leftover provider and plugin .so files in

Hi everyone,

Totally agree - the venue was extremely pleasant and professional at the
same time (a rare combination to get right).  If possible, it would be nice
to also pass this positive feedback to the owner of the venue as I'm sure it
will make them happy.  


Kind regards,

Hi all.
This HF is over - only three Italians stranded in Essen, waiting for their
flights back.
I personally want to deeply thank Horst, Otto, and all those who helped
organize this very successful event. The location is simply ideal, no waste
of time, maximum concentration on coding and discussing (OK, apart from the
bad influence of IT Crowd, damned), a beautiful and quiet place, a friendly
atmosphere, and efficient infrastructure.
In my personal opinion, Villa Vogelsang is the best place we've ever had,
and I would suggest coming back here more or less regularly (e.g.
we could have one itinerant HF per year, and another one here).
Another thing I'd like is to make it easier for people from other continents
to participate (we are too Eurocentric at the moment), without incurring in
too high flight costs. Perhaps we could have simultaneous HFs in each
continent, and be constantly connected in audio and video?
Thanks again to all for contributing to this success, that marks another
step in the history of QGIS.

DOM approach would be fine for read-only access... for operations that
change the hierarchy (e.g. create group G5 within group G3, or move layer L0
to group G4) it would be good to have classes that represent the legend
items, something like this:

class LegendInterface
{
  LegendItem* root(); // return top-level group (virtual) }

class LegendItem
{
  ItemType type(); // either group or layer
  LegendItem* parent();
  QList<LegendItem*> children();
  int indexInParent();

  QString name();
  bool isExpanded();
  // + operations: rename, expand/collapse }

class LegendGroup : LegendItem
{
  bool isVisible();
  // + operations: add child group, remove child group, show/hide ...
}

class LegendLayer : LegendItem
{
  QgsMapLayer* layer();
  bool isVisible();
  // + operations: move to different group, show/hide, refresh symbology
items ...
}

Like this we could get rid of much of the awkwardness of legend interface.
What do you think?

Dear List,
I think this is one (of the many) cases where modeling and documentation of
the application classes (Current and Desirable state) could really help.
AFAIK while it is totally possible to use UML to model the QGIS classes and
procedures (Python and C++ are OO, such a work has not been done and when
issues like this one arise, it is inconvenient to:
	1) Evaluate the current status quo.
	2) Share this knowledge with other community members
	3) Cooperate with other developers to reach to the desired results.
Please, correct me if I am wrong, as I would really like to see UML
documentation of QGIS.
I myself have started such a work, but it progresses really slow, due to
financial and temporal restrictions. In that framework, I will try to model
the current Legend Items and use this thread replies (and my own knowledge)
to model a new proposal.
Martin's Notation is really useful towards that goal, but not as easily
conveyable as a UML model.

Awaiting for your opinions & answers.

Hi,

good idea - the linuxhotel already asked, if we can provide some notes about
what we did / worked on during the hackfest and if we can write a short
report for their webpage with a photo.

Would be nice, if every participant adds some notes about her/his work in the
wiki and if based on these information we provide something for the qgis
community and the linuxhotel.

I started a Results section here:

Very good Martin!
I haven't thought about it, but do you think Globe could be a background to
do such visualisations (through Python)?

Sidenote: What I'm really willing is something to develop 3D spatial data
management/analysis... That's what really has moved proprietary solutions
steps beyond OS...

Hi all,
I have this error when I try to use Manager() from python multiprocessing

(Just start QGIS open Python console and execute the two following lines)

>>> import multiprocessing

>>> mgr = multiprocessing.Manager()

Traceback (most recent call last):

It happens in both 1.8 and 1.9 dev version on Windows X. Of course
everything is ok using QGIS on Linux!... :P


It seems something related to the main Python/QGis process startup and the
way the library tries to start a new process.... but I can't figure out any
workaround.


Any idea?

I'm testing it, today it doesn't work at all (except displaying
stars) though yesterday I was able to vote both as logged or
anonymous user.

Yes, this would really make the voting system valid.
Most of the users doesn't go to the plugins site, they
install plugin directly from QGis.

IIRC the installer/manager refactoring was discussed
in Lisbon (5th HF) and it should include a way to send
votes to the webapp.

A really nice feature! Is it possible to send votes via the plugin? So
that I can implement a button box with "Vote for the plugin" and
"Remmind me later" and so on. How to integrate it with python?

Hi,

I will add an RPC webservice for voting plugins. I'll let the list
know when done.

And thanks again for the perfect hackfest organization!

Works for me right now, but if you find problems, please file a ticket
adding your browser brand and version and all other details might be
useful to reproduce the issue.

RPC method is online:

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/RPC2/

it returns cookie informations, you can ignore it.

At the moment there is no control for double/multiple voting in the
WebService , you should take care for yourself that the user doesn't
vote more than once.

Great work!

We might be able to use something like this in the plugin installer

For this we need to put plugin rating into repo xml or provide RPC call for
getting vote for particular (maybe all at once?) plugin.

Seems, it is time for installer refactoring/update

Subject: [Qgis-developer] testing core python plugins from build tree
Message-ID: <20121008150208.GA25406@gnash>

I recently realized that db_manager plugin moved to core repository
and it was a pity to find out that such a move made development
process harder than it was.

When the plugin was out of code I simply symlinked its source dir
under ~/.qgis/python/plugins/db_manager, hacked, reloaded with
plugin reloaded and could immediately see the changes.

With plugin in core I can't do this anymore, unless (maybe, but
I didn't test) if I build qgis within the source tree, rather than
in a separate build tree.

I've seen there's a ticket for this problem already:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5879
would it just be a matter of installing the python plugins under
output/ dir and set an environment variable to force scan of
a dir before the others ?

But it is still possible to symlink core plugin dir to ~/.qgis/python/plugins/
create temporary makefile to compile ui and start hacking.

"create temporary makefile" doesn't seem that straightforward, but
sounds like the shortest path. Hopefully I can just symlink the Makefile
in the build tree...

Well, it wasn't enough:
 
  ImportError: No module named ui_DlgDbError

at this point I'm not even sure db_manager is supposed to work
even after install. Giuseppe, does it ?

 Makefile -> ../../../b/python/plugins/db_manager/Makefile

Where ../../../b is my build tree, so the Makefile generated
by cmake.

Massimo has made a pull request [1] to add a
groupLayerHierarchy method that returns a QDomDocument.

Here's my opinion (see the pull request comments):

> data (e.g between different QGis installations) and we already

I totally agree with Martin, we need to implement some
classes to give plugin devs the opportunity to work on the
legend using an API.

Furthermore I don't understand why having a new xml
document with it's own tags/elements.
The QgsProject.write(...) calls the QgsLegend.writeXml(...)
to write all the stuff needed to re-create the legend tree,
so we could just expose the QgsLegend.writeXml().

BTW, in the meantime the API is developed you could
save a temporary project file and parse it.
Note: you need to restore the project filename after done
because the QgsProject.write(QFileInfo) changes it.

Here's XML elements you need to know to get legend
info from project file:

*<legend>* is the legend root tag.
It can contains both *legendlayer* and *legendgroup* elements.

A legend layer can contains more sublayers,
it has the following structure:

<legendlayer name="mylayer1" checked="Qt::Checked">
    <filegroup>
        <legendlayerfile id="mylayer120121008125355262" />
    </filegroup>
</legendlayer>

where the *filegroup* elem contains the sublayers with their id.

Group info is stored into a *legendgroup* element,
it can contains both *legendlayer* and *legendgroup* elements:

<legendgroup name="mygroup1" checked="Qt::Checked">
    <legendlayer name="mylayer1">...</legendlayer>
    <legendgroup name="mygroup2" checked="Qt::Checked">
        <legendlayer name="mylayer2">...</legendlayer>
    </legendgroup>
</legendgroup>

Regards.

I meant QgsLegend.writeProject(QDomDocument)

and also here, no sublayers...
filegroup is there I guess only for compatibilty.

Btw., the legend code is quite old and probably needs a complete 
redesign to make it easier maintainable. I think it would be good to do 
this before exposing all the things in the legend to plugins (but I 
don't know if there is any volunteer for it?).

Regards,
Marco

So I think the ui_DlgDbError is being generated but in _build_ tree,
while the icon are only in _source_ tree. As a consequence there's
no way to find a directory with everything needed in it to use
for testing purposes. Is then the only solution to have the plugins
installed under the output/ dir at build time ?  What's blocking
that fix ? Can I help in any way ?

Wrong analysis, same problem when building in source tree:

  ImportError: No module named ui_DlgDbError

The only way to really try the plugin is by installing the whole qgis,
which is very unrecommended.

Thanks, meanwhile I tried two things. First, I renamed
/usr/lib/grass64 to something else and then run configure. It helped.
Second, I created completely fresh build directory and run
configuration (with not renamed /usr/lib/grass64). It worked too. My
impression is that problem was in CMakeCache.txt. So simple removing
of CMakeCache.txt could probably help too.

Hi all.
Apparently this is a very serious problem also in Korea, and I imagine
also in many other countries. People solve this by either downgrading to
1.7.4, or using a nextgis package.
I remember a lengthy discussion on this, but I cannot recall the conclusion.
Is there something I can do to help fixing it? I would like to at least
show a way for the solution at the FOSS4G Korea, in the next days.
Thanks a lot.

There is and option in master to disable shapefile encoding detection
"Settings-Options-General-Ignore shape encoding". Just check it
and choose proper encoding when opening shapefile

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to get all attributes from a non geometry
 PostGIS layer with Python in QGIS
Message-ID: <1349778995032-5007381.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi!
I'm struggling with a problem for a few hours and can't find a solution.
Maybe you can help me.
I'm developing a PythonPlugin for QGIS where the user first loads some
layers from a PostGIS Database via "Add PostGIS Layers" and then should
add/delete some Values from these Layers.
The Problem is that it seems Python in QGIS is not (yet?) able to
read/delete Values from non geometry Tables. (Adding new rows to non
geometry tables works...)
Can you confirm this? QGIS itself is able to work with these layers/tables
so I hoped this would be possible with Python.
(I also opened a thread here about this problem:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/35147/)


Another Question:
Is there an overview about all existing Python bindings for QGIS? 

Regards
Basti

Subject: [Qgis-developer]  Oracle Plugin Error Compiling QGIS 1.8
In-Reply-To: <20121009180908.2185b4ef@nature.speedport.ip>
Message-ID: <1349802002.49579.YahooMailClassic@web165006.mail.bf1.yahoo.com>

I am having difficulty compiling QGIS 1.8 in Windows XP using VC 2008.

The only plugin that is ending in error (the real problem) is the Oracle plugin. While it compiles without error, duing the linking I get these two unresolved external errors about two methods. I can not overcome these. Would anyone shed some light as to what libraries I am to add. I could see these methods in the OGR headers in the GDAL directory. I even added the header file and tried compiling, but it did not work,

I also was wondering why the plugins during linking do not generate the windows plugin dll's . I think prior to version 1.8 (in 1.7.x) they did generate the dll's and one did not need to do an install before getting the dll's.
 
Thank you,

Maaza

Yes, the solution is to copy plugin's source files to output/ dir
together with the generated ones during 'make' in addition to 'make
install'. But still you probably would want to symlink your plugin to
~/.qgis/python/plugins because otherwise you would need to run 'make'
every time after changing your source .py files to get it updated
within output/ dir.

Okay I removed the Oracle raster Plugin. 
I an not able to add to the menu. My C++ Plugin used to show up well at 1.7, what more has changed that it is not showing up in 1.8? I added the category property and made sure I have appropriate methods for it.  

Is there a place to read what has changed? If I have missed the communication, would someone point me to where I can find the changes? 

Thank you,

I'm not used to cmake, can anyone more skilled about it take care
of this ? Or is it something that needs to be done on a per-plugin
basis ? Is there any plugin doing this already ?

The symlink doesn't work if you build outside of the source tree
(built files and source files are in two different directories).
I don't mind running "make" on each change, I'm used to that :)

which has the ability to show specific "POI" if I say "jump to the
following coordinates...". The GUI should be minimalistic - only the map
and zooming buttons in an appropriate size (to use it with a touchscreen
while driving a shaking course e.g.). So, claimed capabilities should
be:

- Minimalistic GUI with big buttons
- jump to specific coordinates (with help of the API?)


Is it possible to realize it with QGIS and the Python plugin
capability?


Thanks/cheers
Chris

Sure, it is possible. For example look at Nathan's QMap [0]

Subject: [Qgis-developer] secure qgis.org - SSL certificate
Message-ID: <1349871980.5269.10.camel@kk-office.gslwd>

Hi,

at the HF we started to talk about making qgis.org a little bit more
secure.
At the moment, the password that is used to authenticate for the wiki,
bugtracker etc is transmitted in cleartext. I urge everybody to not use
the same password than for their onlinebanking at the moment (you
probably know that you shouldn't anyway and of course have not been
using the same password on different sites, right?).

Nevertheless, this needs to be fixed.

Short summary of options (incomplete):

cacert
http://www.cacert.org/
Open approach to certification, based on community efforts.
Unfortunately not installed by default on most browsers.

thawte
http://www.thawte.com/
Looks like they offered free certificates to opensource projects some
years ago. Maybe we could ask them if this offer is still valid.

comodo
http://www.comodo.com/
Pretty cheap offers

startssl
https://www.startssl.com/
Also cheap offers (starting from free)

Would we need a wildcard certificate? Probably yes, as we want it to be
valid for hub.qgis.org, wiki.qgis.org etc...

Here discussion I found for another opensource project which changed its
provider for ssl certificate:
http://drupal.org/node/1386548

In the end they ordered one on http://www.namecheap.com/

What do you think?

Message-ID: <CAMFSZzqLEJUgK26QOT0O5HV=unEUbfLYyP43whgPDh-M5x69Bg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am brand new to the QGIS and Linux developer world.
I have built QGIS from source and all has gone well.

I have also been following Tim Sutton's tutorials on this development, and
while attempting to add a raster layer (tutorial
4<http://blog.qgis.org/node/94>)
but am getting a strange error when compiling.
The qgsRasterLayer class
#include "gdal.h" which now gives me a file not found error.

I am sure that I am doing something wrong as I know that I have gdal 1.9.0
installed in the default path, and that the QGIS build found it without
problems.
Could someone please point me in the right direction.

Much appreciated

What version of linux are you on?

In order to compile you need to have the -dev version of various
packages (aka the source code of those packages). So you're probably
missing libgdal-dev

On Debian/Ubuntu the following will auto install what's needed for you:
sudo apt-get build-dep qgis

Though I thought the build would fail if you were missing those.

Enjoy,
Alex

I'm a little confused, both Gary and Tim are well aware of this issue (I
brought it up more than a year ago, and have asked them several times
about it). I've been asking them to get a free cert from StartSSL, once
done I can easily put it in place on the server.

I would have done it myself but I don't have official keys to the
qgis.org domain, someone who has those has to make the cert request.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,

not sure if there is another way, but I added something similar for
displaying XML Exception reports in the WPS client.

Have a look at the 'errorHandler' function in [1].

You need python-sip-dev

did you follow the build instructions in the INSTALL file? Those are
mainly for debian/ubuntu but general dependencies should be the same.

Is there a guide for building qgis on fedora?

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7wB_wFZgm3qVZ1107CrcwB8rssBQ5oShHQ4OSOVu6Tocg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I have just done a quick check for new plugins, and found one named "OGR
transformation". To my surprise, it is a SEXTANTE-based one! There is no
author information, but I would like to get in contact with the developers,
since some things, specially the DB-related ones, are something that I
planned to add to SEXTANTE. Also, I could help with the other algorithms,
with some improvement ideas.

So, if you are the author or this module and would like me to help you and
eventually including those algorithms in the core colelction of SEXTANTE
ones...just say something :-)

Regards, and thanks to everyone using SEXTANTE.

Victor

p.s. I did a quick search before pressing the "send" button....and I see
that, if I am not wrong Pirmin is the author. Anyway, I send the message
here to let people know that I am open to all kinds of collaborations
around SEXTANTE, so please get in contact with me if you are doing
something with SEXTANTE :-)

Hi

I am running Ubuntu 12.04, and as mentioned I was able to build Qgis
successfully.
It is when I attempt to use the Qgis libraries in a custom application
built in Qt Creator, that I get the error.
My first thought was that I need to include the gdal library in my
application as well, but that doesn't seem to work.

Any help would be appreciated

Thanks

Hi all.
I think our manual is already in good shape, but if Otto thinks QGIS
will profit from his participation to the Doc Sprint, I'd be glad, and
we can cover the extra costs.
All the best.

Hi all.
The security issue can be solved quickly also with a self-signed
certificate, right? I trust Gary more than Verisign ;)
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Yes, self-signing would be a possibility as well.
The Problem with this approach is, that anybody would have to accept
this certificate to be trusted and people who don't know Gary would
probably be scared away by their browser showing warnings all over the
place and offering a "get me out of here" button.

Cheers

well, that's what keysinging parties are for.
I think we (at least the PSC) mutually singed our signatures.
Otherwise, we can confirm them with other methods, it should be easy
these days.
All the best.

As far as I can see, key signing parties are to build a web of trust and
people outside this network will still see a warning in their browser.
Or did I get something wrong here?

no you got it right, I guess paolo's reasonement was that if you want https
is because you have an account so you should be interested in trusting us.
but i dont agree too much. we should aim for the lowest entry barrier as
possible.

Hi,

In my opinion we should either buy a real certificate (e.g. from
startssl.com) - we have some money in the QGIS account for such
expenses. It will save us (and especially our users) a lot of headache
if we use certificates that are accepted by all browsers. And it doesn't
cost a fortune nowadays.

We should probably opt for a wildcard certificate, allowing the use with
mutiple servers under the qgis.org domain, e.g. plugins.qgis.org,
www.qgis.org, planet.qgis.org, hub.qgis.org, etc.

A two year wildcard domain certificate costs 60 US$ at startssl.com: see
https://www.startssl.com/?app=39

I purchased certificates from StartSSL and it works fine. On initial
registration you have to file copy of your passport and they give you a
phone call to ensure that you exist at the address you registered. After
that you can issue one or more certificates.

Thank you for clearing Marco,

I think it might be a good idea to contact Thawte and ask, if they would
help us with signing.

Quote:
"Thawte is proud of its open source lineage. Providing free certificates
to community projects is just a small way of not only supporting the
community but returning the favor. Please spread the word."

I also found out that at godaddy you can get free ssl certificates for
open source projects (not wildcard certificates - but for single servers).

This is offered by:

* certum.eu
* thawte
* startssl
* godaddy

If you google for free ssl certificates for open source projects you
will find some links.

a 1-minute google search with keywords "fedora building qgis" leads to
this howto

http://www.surfaces.co.il/?p=340

Although it is slightly outdated, it suggests you install the
sip-devel package, which you probably have not installed yet.

Please try searching before posting multiple emails to lists.

Hi, that tutorial is quite old, and qgis has changed quite a bit since
then...

most probably your gdal.h is not in the include search path.

Did you instal libgdal-dev with your package manager?

If not you need to set CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH and possibly C_INCLUDE_PATH to
the include dir where you installed gdal.

cheers

I am interested in getting documentation for QGIS improved. I am one of those who yells at the top of my voice and I seem to get no response. I am willing to put some time in to this project. 

I think a comprehensive documentation at least for the development side would be an excellent addition to QGIS. 

Please check out the research document produced, largely from QGIS built plugin toolset at the following link http://transweb.sjsu.edu/project/1005.html . Download the PDF document and you can see the modeling done using QGIS, you may even enjoy the bikie map of San Jose at http://www.axumcorp.com/sjbikemap.htm .

I live not very far from the Google's office and if my current availability continues I may be able to devote at least three days to the project. Is there any other person interested in pursuing this?

Maaza

Dear GSoC mentors and org admins,?

Google Summer of Code in collaboration with Aspiration and FLOSS Manuals is hosting a "Doc Sprint Camp" at Google's Mountain View headquarters (California) Dec 3 - 7, 2012.






The 2012 Doc Camp will feature:


1) An unconference on free software documentation topics - facilitated by Aspiration

2) 2-5 Book Sprints to produce books on free softwares - facilitated by FLOSS Manuals

Building on the success of the 2011 GSoC Doc Camp we are proud to bring you the 2012 GSoC Doc Camp. Like the previous event the 2012 GSoC Doc Camp is a place for free software communities to meet, create a book for their project, attract new people to their efforts, and share their documentation experiences. The camp aims to improve free documentation materials and skills in free software projects and individuals and help form the identity of the emergent free documentation sector.







Individuals and projects can apply. Food and accommodation for all individuals will be provided and travel support (full or partial) can also be applied for.

Be a part of this exciting event ? propose a Book Sprint on your favorite free software or come and help others write a book on their favorite project. Guaranteed to be a lot of fun, productive, and a fantastic place to advance your documentation efforts and experiences.







For more information or to register to take part, please see?https://sites.google.com/site/docsprintsummitv2/.?
Please note proposals are due by October 26, so get yours in ASAP!







Cheers,
Carol Smith, Allen Gunn, Adam Hyde

Hi Otto and All,

sorry for delay in my response, we spent all this week thinking - to be 
or not to be. And the final decision from my and my colleague side is - 
TO BE!

So we are ready to take responsibility about next Quantum GIS hakcfest.
The proposal still is available here: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tZT1gpsw0W51WDn0U4TeRb4bDYwuvi0tGi2DrxjcVdk/edit#heading=h.bowsa9ffbdr7

For us is very important ASAP know the dates so that we are not making 
collision with garage48 event (this year it was 27-29th April and seems 
that next will be in similar time).

Unfortunatly, it's not working. I forgot to comment old line wich was:

        settings = QSettings("HKEY_USERS\\S-1-5-21-135220595-821698489-1543119021-16853\\Software\\QuantumGIS\\QGIS",QSettings.NativeFormat)
and is working, but it's not a permanent solution.
The last one I mentioned is not working:
        settings = QSettings( QSettings.NativeFormat, QSettings.UserScope, 'QuantumGIS', 'QGis')
I use InitQGis in my app, but  QSettings() return nothing, so maybe here's a bug...

Thanks for interest!

You  are right. With no args QSettings outside Qgis return nothing. After consultinq Qt doc and with your help, this code is working:

QSettings( QSettings.NativeFormat, QSettings.UserScope, 'QuantumGIS', 'QGis')

Diving into Python, Qt and Pyqgis since few months, I have new questions each day, and each day, I find answers...

Great job made by all developpment teams and plugins developpers , where I can find lots of code.

Hi Pierre,

yes this is the right approach.  However, you must make sure that the proper organisation (QuantumGIS) and application (QGIS) are set.  Your problem is probably because the QSettings is initialized with some default values.

This is done automatically when using plugins in the qgis app, but not if your are creating an external app.

Although it should happen when calling QgsApplication.initQgis() - you might want to file a bug report for that.

BTW - you might get more feedback if posting to the qgis-devel mailing list.

Hi Victor,

I did a short a presentation of the OGR and INTERLIS transformations plugin in 
Lyon, where we met! The source code is on https://github.com/pka/qgis-
ogrprocessing-plugin and there is a (german) screencast using the plugin: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dx-wOAVGfhc .
I'm very interested to integrate the DB related stuff into Sextante, but didn't 
have enough time for a complete Sextante patch. I hoped thet Sextante gets a 
separate git repostory , which would make it easier to send pull requests.

Regards
Pirmin

Hey Pirmin, you mentioned that in lyon and I remember discussing that
with you...but now it is much bigger! there are several algorithms and
some more advanced stuff... I guess that when I talked to you I did
not expect that you were going for such a large plugin :-)

I can put your code into the SEXTANTE  folder in the QGIS repo in a
new branch and we can work there. I am interested on it, for sure.

Just tell me what you think

Thanks!

why in a branch? I do noth think it will cause harm to put it in main,
and it will be easier to have more feedback.
Thanks!

Hi P?teris,

good news :) and thanks a lot for your offer again. We are looking forward to
having a hackfest in Valmiera.

For the date, maybe you propose one or two dates to the list, because you
know what is the best time to be in Valmiera. As you know, usually the
spring hackfests are in (around) april, but I guess we are open to your
suggestions.

Kind Regards
Otto

FYI, there may be an opportunity to organize an more global OSGeo codesprint 
in Paris beginning of June. It's still in the early stage of discussion, but 
there are good chances for it to see the light.
In that case if some devs want to attend both, it's better if they are not too 
close in terms of dates.
I'll try to get some infos as soon as possible, but that is just an 
information for the moment, it should not be a real blocker for any date for 
next QGIS hackfest.

Keep in touch,

Vincent

Hi All,

so the best dates from our side:
a) 11-14 April - it's +/- typical hackfest time;
b) 2 - 5 May - because holiday week in Latavia, typically already nice 
weather;
c) 9 - 12 May - alternative for option b + someone who stays longer has 
an additional option to promote QuantumGIS :)

If these dates are OK we can make some Doodle, to decide.

Best,

Thanks for bringing this up Paolo.

I would like to go to a QGIS hackfest, but the European venues are not
financially feasible for me (and probably not for others as well). The
hackfests seem to generate very positive momentum for the project, as
well as code.

I am definitely in favor of attending one here (in the US). If it
could coincide with another going on in another part of the world,
that would be very cool.

If one were to be in the US, obviously having it in a locale with an
international airport seems logical. How were accommodations for
FOSS4G in Denver (2011)?

How many are interested in a sister hackfest in the US, ideally one
video- or audio-linked to another in Europe (or elsewhere)?

Regards,

Larry

Gary and I have chatted about this. The west coast is somewhat ideal and
the further north the better (in terms of shorter/cheaper flights,
especially for the Alaska crew).

The main characters that I know of to involve would be:
Larry - Dakotas
Aaron Racicot - Oregon
Gary Sherman - Alaska (+ a couple of people Gary works with)
Alex Mandel (me) - Davis, CA
Bob M.(cgsbob) - Sacramento, CA
Jctull - Reno, Nv

Seattle or Portland seem like good candidates with CUGOS and PDX-OSGeo
chapters. OSGeo Sprint was outside Seattle last year. Also there is the
OSGeo North America in Minnesota this April.

Of course I'm willing to host at UC Davis if it helps, since I can get
rooms relatively easily but we need help organizing donations to keep us
fed.

Thanks,
Alex

Apologies, if I left anyone out - please add yourself to the list if
QGIS HF sounds good to you (we should probably start a wiki page).

Hi

I guess it's due to some restructuring .. I missed it at the same moment
but cannot tell you what happened .. looking directly at the server
there are some rst files and different directories with languages ..
Seems that Otto is doing something there ..

Yes, I think having multiple simultaneous HFs would be good, so that
also the Ozzies and the Far East communities can join in.
Of course more HFs=more people=more expenses, so we have to be careful
about costs. Ideally every community should be able to raise local
sponsors to cover, at least partly, local costs.
All the best.

I'm going to see if I can get some interest to get a Aussie QGIS HF going
here.  Will try and make it line up with the next one.

Somehow the sphinx-build failed - rerunning it solved the problem.  Maybe that
was also related to the system upgrade - same for the nightly builds btw.

I suppose Otto got an automatic email about the problem, but also didn't find
time to get to it yet.

Hi list,

is it possible to send an input (API?) with coordinates of a specific 
point of interest to QGIS and make the map to render/jump to this 
specific point?
Background fire services: a alarm address (coordinates) should be shown 
on the map to explore the structure and the area around.


Thanks and cheers,
Chris

Hi,

I'm developing a python plugin in QGIS 1.9.0-master that makes QGIS
segfault when I call Qgsvectorlayer.select() inside a geometryChanged
signal handler

My code looks like this:

...

layer_A.geometryChanged.connect(self.onLineGeometryChange)

...

@pyqtSlot(int, QgsGeometry)
def onLineGeometryChange(self, featureId, geom ):
  ...
  layer_B.select( someRectangle, False )
  ---


Is it illegal to call "select()" inside "onLineGeometryChange()"?

By the way, I'm not really interested in selecting features. I only
wanted to find the existing features inside a map area, but I didn't
find any other way but using "select()"


Thanks in advance and best regards,

Hi again,

I forgot to mention that QGIS only segfaults when using the node tool
of mDigitizeToolBar.

It does not crash when I use the move feature tool.

Hi,

see various panning/extent functions in qgsmaplayer

http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsMapCanvas.html

You would probably want to use setExtent(), by calculating the
rectangle you want, centered on your point of interest.

Also see the qgis cookbook map canvas section

http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/canvas.html

cheers
Etienne

Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yLikvPC-OzJEpBmgNts_2=qd-40oJqKZzAgzi7yE=0fQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

I was thinking about starting a blog to post QGIS-related stuff,
mostly tips&tricks about the SEXTANTE plugin, but also about other
things, but since there are other people doing something similar (and
writing really great posts), I think it would be a good idea to
coordinate this a bit. To make it short...anyone fancy the idea of
creating a collective blog to write small tutorials, recipes, etc,
about QGIS? I think that would be good for the QGIS community, and it
should not be hard to manage. It wouldn't be an official thing (by the
way, is the official QGIS blog dead?), but with all the people that
writes about QGIS, and with a little effort to make good posts and
give them some homogeneity, it can become a reference point for the
community of QGIS users and developers.

It might be just a silly idea, so feel free to tell me your opinion on this.

Cheers
Victor

Isn't the QGIS Planet intention to be exactly that ?
http://qgis.org/planet/

Only difference is that posts are only aggregated there, avoiding the need of 
yet another one dedicated tool.

Hi

I have installed the library as suggested, and have included it in the
search path. Still no Joy.
With regards to the tutorial itself, seeing as it is obsolete, is there a
more recent tutorial highlighting the basic features of the newer version
of the API?

Thanks
Justin

Hi,

I would opt to stick with our current solution of distributed blogs
and the planet aggregator.
>From where I stand, it makes no sense for me to start posting my QGIS
posts somewhere else than on my blog. I think others feel the same
way.
Also, it would blow up our web infrastructure one again ...

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi

Thanks for you replies!

I am aware of the QGIS planet, but the idea I had was a bit different.
It does not replace the aggregator, of course, it is just another
blog, but created by a group of people instead of just one, which
would allow to have a more homogeneous stlye (not just in terms of
appearance, as the aggregator can do, but in terms of approach,
quality, etc).

I have seen that idea in other fields, where several bloggers (in many
cases, having themselves very popular blogs that they keep on writing
in parallel) associate to create a new one.

Anyway, I have ideas for many posts and I would like to start this
kind of "QGIS cookbook" blog, so if anyone is intererested in joining,
just let me know.

And of course, please keep on writing in your blogs, you are all doing
an awesome work :-)

Best
Victor

By the way, that one is different from this one:

http://planet.qgis.org/planet/

Are these two different applications (the number of aggregated blogs are 
different for both).

http://planet.qgis.org/planet/ is showing some minor css issues here 
with me in Firefox.

hi!
I think this are all the things that should be consolidated .. we have
toooo many different pages with the same goal ..
In terms of usability and mainainability we should move content and
delete a lot of those pages like it is considered to be done with the
main page - once we have a design and a "howto move".
But it seems to me that people are afraid of breaking something when
we delete/move something ..
Of course there will be people complaining about not finding or not
being to link to a page anymore but .. otherwise it will soon be not
managable any more .. :(
It's nice to offer a lot of different opportunities but we have to
think about our main direction ..

kind regards
Werner

Hi Marco and All,

1) I have made a doodle to vote (http://doodle.com/zayzu69vptqwfzks 
<http://doodle.com/zayzu69vptqwfzks> ) for best dates. It would be good 
to decide till end of next week  - 26th October.
2) Maybe is worth to move our proposal and event description to Quantum 
GIS wiki or do it immediately after 26th October?

Regards,

It's just idea to invite someone to geography students field coureses to 
make some persentation for them and other profesors, lecturers and 
teachers. It's approx 100km from Valmiera, but this idea must be 
discussed more detailed with Maris Nartiss.

Hi P?teris,

could you move your proposal to the wiki and add all information and points
we need to discuss there? I started a wiki page here:

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/9_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Valmiera_2013

Otto

Thanks P?teris,

looks good! :) I added a link to Upcoming Events on qgis.org and the Doodle
link to the wiki page as well. I think we wait until 26th or End of October
and maybe the can then already make a decision about the date and all other
things.

Regards
Otto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] updating pyspatialite on windows
Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4E43ED942C1@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>

Hi,

I would like to update the pyspatialite library in Python :
Windows 7
Qgis 1.7

I 've downloaded last package available (3.01), assuming QGis 1.7 version is 2.6.2.
I'm using gcc (cygwin) to compile.
After solving some problems, I'm stuck !
I think it's a path format (Unix / Dos) conflict :

Pirmin,

I have been checking the plugin and I think it make sense to put it
into SEXTANTE. Just a little favor: could you write some text to
describe how to install the software that it is needed by the plugin,
so I can add it to the "configuring 3rd party apps" doc?

Thanks in advance

I hope I can work a bit on your code and add some other algorithm (for
instance, the execute SQL one is nice, but if the SQL sentence
generates something that can be put into a layer, that would give a
lot of possibilities in the modeler, so I might create an additional
algorithm to handle that situation)

Great work! Thanks again!

Davis would have the added benefit of being a reasonably short drive for me. :-) In addition, it is accessible by BART and train from SFO. Portland and Seattle are also great venues, so it might depend on the costs for Gary and others that would be needed to really pull off something useful. I don't have coding skills, but can happily test, debug and provide opinions, assuming timing and locale permit attendance.

Hello all,
first - it would be nice to decide on dates as early as possible as
then we can make agreement with venue space provider (VBII) about
reserving particular time just for us. As soon as venue is booked,
there's no hurry any more.

second - please discard Peteris idea about promoting QGIS during field
course. My liver wouldn't survive such event. Still it's probably
possible to arrange a presentation lecture at the University of
Latvia, faculty of Geography and Earth sciences (located in Riga), if
any of QGIS "representatives" is willing to do so.

Maris.

Andreas, I think this also should be added to the mind map.

	October 2012
Message-ID: <20121016160610.14ebaaf7@nature.speedport.ip>

Dear QGIS Community,

based on the wiki entries I added a website with a few notes on our recent
hackfest / community meeting in Essen from 3-7 October:

http://www.qgis.org/en/developer-meetings/essen-102012.html

If others have posted similar articles about their experiences or pics it
would be great to add a link to this page. I already added a few.

The QGIS Porject just wanted to say publically a very big THANK YOU to our
sponsors and to everyone who donates to the QGIS project - your funding
allows us to hold these meetings which really help the project to keep its
momentum!

Looking forward to the next one!

Hi, new to the list and already one suggestion.
Up to now i didn't know anything about QGIS planet, but i really believe
that a central website which supplies people with open source (Q)GIS
information is really needed. For example, i am a big fan and regularly
visitor to the r-bloggers <http://www.r-bloggers.com/>website. Maybe a
similar set up could be established with concrete tagging and sorting of
posts (QGIS development posts, new features, plugin presentations,
tutorials, ... ).
If it runs, other open source GIS software like GRASS could be included too.

Don't forget that http://planet.osgeo.org/ exists as a central place
for FOSS4G posts.

This copy of QGIS writes debugging output.

I am not sure what procedure it needs. I can only see that I am using a
different Spatialite library. It may be that spatialite dropped some methods
that were present in 2.4.0.
  Is there any other requirement I am missing when I copy the "dll" file? Is
there a diffrence in the library. I downloaded the source using GIT and the
version was 1.8 Master.

Hi,

I'm developping a standalone apllication with python qt and pyqgis and I would like to update this tools
I'm triyng to migrate from 1.7 to 1.8, so from python 2.5 to python 2.7...
My IDE is pyscripter.
With env 1.8 when I run my dev from pyscriter it's slower than with 1.7 and there's messages in the output window like that :

d:\src\qgis-1.8.0\src\core\qgsproviderregistry.cpp(364) : (QgsProviderRegistry::provider) Library name is C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS Lisboa/apps/qgis/plugins/spatialiteprovider.dll

d:\src\qgis-1.8.0\src\core\qgsvectorlayer.cpp(4521) : (QgsVectorLayer::setCoordinateSystem) ----- Computing Coordinate System

It's just like each cpp QGis function run in a verbose mode.

It wasn't like this with 1.7.

How can I solve it ?

It seems to be Rails competing with redmine and a compile process with
gcc in the background ..
struggling for computing time ..
and then apache and mysql are jumping in to complete the field ;)

probably time to move some processes on different machines?

you could use nice -19 to gcc processes...

So the minutely sphinx builds are gone now?    Three of them were competing to
update the website, when I looked.   I changed the cron entry to run it every
15 minutes and added locking to the script - so just one process runs at a
time.

But still redmine is consuming a lot of resources although nobody (even Pirmin)
knows exactly why...

I suppose something is indexing redmine again - yesterday googlebot and baidu
visited simultaniously, but I'm not sure that was the actually issue...

AFAICT only redmine is consuming lots of CPU.  Not sure what to do about it...

I changed the sphinx cronjob to 4 times a day.

Hi!
Regarding Bug #3349] (Closed) Histogram is wrong if raster has
negative values, Giovanni Manghi closed the issue saying:
"In QGIS master they seems ok to me. Reopen if necessary."

I do not have master. Could anybody please use this tif file
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/testhist.tif

and send me an screen capture of the qgis histogram to verify?
As a reference, an screenshot
http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3180464/histproblem.jpeg

of what I currentely get with QGIS and the correct histogram in R

(I actually tried to implement this and other tools using the R
interface in Sextante, but I did not get
that interface to work)

Hi!
Maybe there is a new redmine version available? Probably I have time
to check later this evening ..
And maybe we should really stick to "up-to-date" versions and seperate
some things..
As building machine I can offer a VM at the (powerful) server of a
friend of mine ..

You built qgis with debug mode enabled.

You can suppress debug output by setting env. variable QGIS_DEBUG=-1

or run cmake again with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release and re-build qgis

Hi all,

Le mardi 25 septembre 2012 15:47:14, Etienne Tourigny a ?crit :

We at Oslandia are working on 3D processing in databases and visualization.

We have an early piece of code opening a 3D vector layer in QGIS and feeding 
it to QGIS Globe. This works with real 3D objects loaded from database, and 
should work with 2.5D (x, y, z) shapefiles too theoritically.

We have to get it in a better shape before starting to provide pull requests 
on this, but you should see this coming in a couple of months.

Then this will open a whole new range of needs with 3D data, but one step 
after the other...

Message-ID: <507EDD9C.8060004@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently we can use a variety of expressions in field calculator.
UNfortunately, they cannot be saved (if not copypasting as text). It
seems feasible and reasonable to save them as an XML, so we can reload
it. If saved with the same name and in the same dir as the original
file, they could be autoloaded just as we do for styles. In this way it
would be easy to keep calculations updated.
Thoughts?
All the best.

Native fTools. Regular points and grids are not available in SEXTANTE yet.
This and others missed tools are in my TODO. I already reviewed Analysis
and Geoemtry tools groups in SEXTANTE and fixed some bugs. Will continue
to work on porting other tools and bugfixing

Your cmake command looks a little shy on options. This is what I use:

# force llvm instead of clang under XCode 4.4.1 (uses GNU 4.2.1)
export CC=/usr/bin/llvm-gcc
export CXX=/usr/bin/llvm-g++

/usr/local/bin/cmake -D
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="/Users/larrys/QGIS/github.com/QGIS_Apps" \
    -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="RelWithDebInfo" \
    -D WITH_ASTYLE=FALSE \
    -D ENABLE_TESTS=TRUE \
    -D WITH_INTERNAL_SPATIALITE=FALSE \
    -D WITH_PYSPATIALITE=FALSE \
    -D SPATIALINDEX_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/include/spatialindex \
    -D SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY=/usr/local/lib/libspatialindex.dylib \
    -D QWT_LIBRARY=/usr/local/qwt-5.2.2/lib/libqwt.dylib \
    -D QWT_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/qwt-5.2.2/include \
    -D BISON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/local/bin/bison \
    -D WITH_MAPSERVER=TRUE \
    -D WITH_APIDOC=FALSE \
    -D QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=2 \
   ../Quantum-GIS

Of note, the SPATIALINDEX_INCLUDE_DIR and SPATIALINDEX_LIBRARY are
necessary for CMake to properly find the way libspatialindex is
installed. Also, either your copy/paste failed, or you are building in
the source directory (i.e. your command ends in just one .). Consider
doing an out-of-source build as outlined in the INSTALL doc. My build
directory is beside the QGIS git directory.

These cmake options are extraneous to a basic build and can be removed:
WITH_ASTYLE, ENABLE_TESTS, WITH_APIDOC

You can use 'ccmake .' from your build directory to access a curses
interface to all the pertinent cmake options, if you are not using a
script to configure.

My build script may be of some use to you:
https://gist.github.com/2902743

You will also want to manually install QScintilla2 and compile its
Python module, which the new Python console uses (instructions are not
currently in the INSTALL doc for Mac, but I will add it today):
http://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/download

These are the basics (for 2.6.2):

# install BEFORE compiling PyQt4 (or re-compile PyQt4 afterwards)
cd <QScintilla source dir>
cd Qt4Qt5
qmake -spec macx-g++ qscintilla.pro
make -j <max number of cores on Mac>
sudo make install

# compile/install PyQt

cd <QScintilla source dir>
cd Python
python2.7 configure.py
make -j <max number of cores on Mac>
sudo make install

# reference my build script on how to patch the module into the
completed/installed Mac QGIS build.

You may want to reference this previous mailing list thread:
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Building-QGIS-in-Mac-OS-X-Mountain-Lion-i-e-10-8-with-QtSQL-support-tp4992577p4993235.html

Lastly, if you can't get QGIS to compile, you could consider using the
nightly build for Mac:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/Download#421-Nightly-Builds

Note, I do not use homebrew for anything; I just follow the INSTALL
docs (which basically work for 10.6, 10.7, 10.8).

Larry

the source compiled and installed version (C++ install) that I have locally
but not the official OSGEO windows release. All the plugins show up on the
locally compiled version of QGIS. But on the OSGEO version only those
without the docable windows show up.

QGIS version 1.8.0-Lisboa
QGIS code revision c64bb9d
Compiled against Qt 4.7.1
Running against Qt  4.7.1
Compiled against GDAL/OGR 1.9.1
Running against GDAL/OGR 1.9.1
GEOS Version 3.2.2
PostgreSQL Client Version 8.3.10
SpatiaLite Version 2.4.0

See the log, from my own compiled version, that the plugin is loaded in my
own installation from the source
Loaded Bike Network Analysis (Path:
C:/qgis1p8p0/plugins/bikenetworkplugin.dll)  0


While both QGIS 1.8 and 1.9.x Master from OSGEO print the following message,

This copy of QGIS writes debugging output.

I am not sure what procedure it needs. I can only see that I am using a
different Spatialite library. It may be that spatialite dropped some methods
that were present in 2.4.0.
  Is there any other requirement I am missing when I copy the "dll" file? Is
there a diffrence in the library. I downloaded the source using GIT and the
version was 1.8 Master.

But in my case QGIS_DEBUG must be set to -1

Objet : [Qgis-developer] migrating from 1.7 to 1.8

Hi,

I'm developping a standalone apllication with python qt and pyqgis and I would like to update this tools
I'm triyng to migrate from 1.7 to 1.8, so from python 2.5 to python 2.7...
My IDE is pyscripter.
With env 1.8 when I run my dev from pyscriter it's slower than with 1.7 and there's messages in the output window like that :

d:\src\qgis-1.8.0\src\core\qgsproviderregistry.cpp(364) : (QgsProviderRegistry::provider) Library name is C:/Program Files/Quantum GIS Lisboa/apps/qgis/plugins/spatialiteprovider.dll

d:\src\qgis-1.8.0\src\core\qgsvectorlayer.cpp(4521) : (QgsVectorLayer::setCoordinateSystem) ----- Computing Coordinate System

It's just like each cpp QGis function run in a verbose mode.

It wasn't like this with 1.7.

How can I solve it ?

The build now only runs when it actually pulled updates.
 
Anyway, apparently the bots are indeed the problem (see [1]).  I blocked them
in robots.txt and now the load seems back to normal.  Maybe there is a better
option in redmine to do something like that - now nothing is indexed anymore...

Message-ID: <CAGe1dXvgx4Z-B7yux_3Hs1q5bPO0-tK_Na6scX=czAqgmoALfQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I have similar problem as Paulo:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2012-April/016557.html
I am trying to compile QGIS against the latest GRASS 7. But ccmake
refuses to set variable LIB_PATH correctly, it uses its default one
(/usr/lib/grass64/lib/libgrass_gproj.so).

***
GDAL 1.9.2, released 2012/10/08
GRASS version: 7.0.svn
GRASS SVN Revision: 53433
GIS Library Revision: 52468 (2012-07-28)
GDAL/OGR: 1.9.2
Python: 2.7.2+
wxPython: 2.8.11.0
Platform: Linux-3.0.0-26-generic-pae-i686-with-Ubuntu-11.10-oneiric
***

Is it possible to build QGIS against GRASS 7? Why does ccmake set the
variable to default?

Not his fault, but my fault...

I am doing some work with a WPS provider, but forgot to start a new
branch. I did later, but it seems that this change remained...

Thanks for the fix

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Problem with a plugin to select polylines
Message-ID: <1350586304750-5009694.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello All,

I am starting to develop my own plugin by starting and following
instructions at www.qgisworkshop.org but the plugin does not work when the
data is a polyline.  Below is part of the plugin that deals with feature
selection.  What do I need to change so that it will select polylines?

def selectFeature(self, point, button):
       QMessageBox.information( self.iface.mainWindow(),"Info", "in
selectFeature function" )
       # setup the provider select to filter results based on a rectangle
       pntGeom = QgsGeometry.fromPoint(point)
       # scale-dependent buffer of 2 pixels-worth of map units
       pntBuff = pntGeom.buffer( (self.canvas.mapUnitsPerPixel() * 1),0)
       rect = pntBuff.boundingBox()
       # get currentLayer and dataProvider
       cLayer = self.canvas.currentLayer()
       selectList = []
       if cLayer:
               provider = cLayer.dataProvider()
               feat = QgsFeature()
               # create the select statement
               provider.select([],rect) # the arguments mean no attributes
returned, and do a bbox filter with our buffered rectangle to limit the
amount of features
               while provider.nextFeature(feat):
                       # if the feat geom returned from the selection
intersects our point then put it in a list
                       if feat.geometry().intersects(pntGeom):
                               selectList.append(feat.id())

               # make the actual selection
               cLayer.setSelectedFeatures(selectList)
       else:
               QMessageBox.information( self.iface.mainWindow(),"Info", "No
layer currently selected in TOC" )

Thanks for the help,

Ed

seems natural; one problem, however: sextante bugtracker has a large
number of categories, which would disappear if moving. I think keeping
them is useful for the project.

Thanks.

Hey Paolo,

Yes I have thought about this, just never got the time to flesh it out.
What would peoples choice be for saving expressions. I have thought
about the last 10 used but having them per layer could be handy to, or
maybe both.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Saving expressions
Hi all.
Currently we can use a variety of expressions in field calculator.
UNfortunately, they cannot be saved (if not copypasting as text). It
seems feasible and reasonable to save them as an XML, so we can reload
it. If saved with the same name and in the same dir as the original
file, they could be autoloaded just as we do for styles. In this way it
would be easy to keep calculations updated.
Thoughts?
All the best.

To me, having them per layer, and loading them automatically if saved
with the same name, seems the most logical way.
Thanks.

Paolo,

The expression text is evaluated against the first feature in the
layer. If the expression doesn't evaluate for first layer there will be
no text. I can have a look at a way to maybe make this better

Hi all.
The preview in the field calculator expression builder is often missing:
is this confirmed? Anyone working on this? Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

For me personally, copy/paste works fine. No need for load and save.

I do not fully understand the use case for autoloading (association with a layer). Can you explain why this is desirable? Do you really always want the same expression in all projects for one particular layer?

In my experience, expressions are used in very specific situations and are generally not really reusable too often.

Thank you for further explanations.

Andreas

I think users will fin useful to have their expression per layer, so
they can refresh a field with the same calculation, without the need to
rememberwhich formula they used (very stupi example: refreshing the AREA
field). In this way, a DBF can be used almost like a spreadsheet.
For advanced users it is probably useless, for newbies it can save a
loto of time, effort and frustration remembering which expression they
used, what is the exact syntax, where (if) they copied the expression
somewhere, etc.

All the best.

 Hi Paolo,

 What do you expect from the loading? Automatic application to the field 
 calculator (sounds scary to me), or just the ability to choose from past 
 expressions?

 If the latter, then maybe a central expression storage (per user) would 
 make more sense than a per layer expression store. Because you may want 
 to reuse the same expression on another similar layer, even in different 
 projects.

 To me the expressions do not have a natural 1:1 match to a layer like 
 the .prj or the .qml file has.

 But I can see value in a central storage of expressions used in the 
 past, regardless of layer and QGIS project. But it would just be used as 
 a way to load and save expressions as templates to start from and not an 
 automatic application to some calculation or the label engines. These 
 settings should be better stored in the project itself rather than in a 
 separate file.

 Do we agree on that or did I misunderstand you?

 Andreas

Dear Shiva:
I use windows and I followed the build instructions found in the link
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Development should help you. If you can
not follow it, at least you must give some indication of where you
experience a problem by posting errors that you get during your compilation. 

I think the build instructions for Linux should be much more easier than
Windows. I would trust you can overcome your problems. Keep at it, do not
give up.

Hi,

I could imagine having several expressions for one layer (depending on 
the field I want to do calculations on) so autoload needs to depend on 
the layer and the field. On the other hand I could imagine having an 
area field in many layers which I want to update with the geometry's 
area. So a possibility to choose from saved expressions (independent of 
the layer) would come in handy, otherwise I end up copy-pasting the same 
expression from one layer to the other :-(
Besides: Shape files are only one data format. If we save only the 
expressions (last ten, or in a user-defined structure) we can apply them 
to any vector data) or the layer expressions are saved in the project(?)
So Nathan, for me it would be both then :)

just some thoughts...

regards

Bernhard

I was able to get the Oracle plugin to compile without errors. The geometry
library files were missing from the OSGeo download. I also added the path to
the headers that were missing (geometry headers) to the project.

Still QGIS 1.8 and 1.9 is not recognizing my plugin, while the locally build
version recognizes them.

We can always have a save button that the user can pick to save a
Application based expression (saved in the QGIS settings), or saved in

Yes, but a list of the expressions used for that table would be useful

This is not my original idea, but I agree it is an interesting
alternative, with its advantages.
Kind of a log of the expressions used per user is a slight variance of this.
All the best, and thanks.

The most useful info here is in the Rlog file that you will find in

That tells us what was the problem with R (if any). Could you please send it?

Hi all,

With a friend of mine, we identifying a bug on Ubuntu with R in sextante.

The bug is : The python subprocess doesn't execute the command.
The solution put the parameter shell to False on linux for the 
subprocess Popen construction.

Python doc 
http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor :
On Windows with shell=True, the COMSPEC environment variable specifies 
the default shell. The only time you need to specify shell=True on 
Windows is when the command you wish to execute is built into the shell 
(e.g. dir or copy). You do not need shell=True to run a batch file or 
console-based executable.

If you want I can open an issue and provide a patch.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Message-ID: <50812FE7.4040102@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
With current osgeo4w, PST fails with:

  File
"/home/paolo/.qgis//python/plugins/pointsamplingtool/doPointSamplingTool.py",
line 273, in accept
    self.sampling(outPath)
  File
"/home/paolo/.qgis//python/plugins/pointsamplingtool/doPointSamplingTool.py",
line 345, in sampling
    ident = rastLayer.identify(point)[1]
AttributeError: 'QgsRasterLayer' object has no attribute 'identify'


Is this related to:
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/commit/b5412cbf950d489c824ff322e0ae9a312f4a06da
and fixed with it?
Thanks.

AFAICS the identify method has moved to QgsRasterDataProvider, and has
changed the signature (now you pass the type of identify).
The pointsamplingtool should be upgraded.

I notice that the identify type is not required.
Simply changing:

ident = rastLayer.identify(point)[1]

to

ident = rastLayer.dataProvider().identify(point)[1]

should work...

Hi guys,
Personally I think saving expressions for every layer is unnecessarily complicated.  Have you thought of just having a drop-down list of recently used expressions, and the ability to "pin" your favourite expressions to the list?  Do people really need expressions to be saved alongside the project/layer?
How are you thinking about doing the gui?  Even if you do implement "program" and "layer" lists of expressions, you could do something like that for the gui: display a list of recently used expressions grouped under "this layer" and "other layers", and with the ability to "pin" favourite expressions.

I agree with Alister that saving expressions for every layer seems
overly complex.

Maybe we could just have an interface similar to Spatialite GUI where
there are forward/backwards buttons besides the SQL input area. They
allow to go back in command history.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

Looking at the source code in the git repository I found out that most
of the Qgsvectorlayer::select() functionality resides in the data
provider, so I decided to write the layers to disk and switch the
layer data provider from "memory" to "ogr".

The problem still persists, so I decided to file a bug report (#6547).

I would liek saving expressions in file and a directory of my own choosing
would be ideal. At least that is what ArcGIS had (As far as version 9.3,
that I have used in the past.)

I would ask for simplicity and ease of use. Why make the project file
bloated and prone to corruption by adding field calculations data into it?
What would happen if a field is deleted and there is a calculation is to be
done against it? I have had to edit some project files because they were
crashing for missing layers.

Admin or Trusted author?

I'm enough mad to trust him :-) (done!) so he doesn't
need to ask for approval, but I cannot grant him any
admin permission.

If he also needs the admin privileges someone else will
grant him admin rights.

Cheers.

Hey, cool!!

Given the work Marco is doing for NIWA's custom version of QGIS, including a random stratified survey design & analysis tool, there is some further synergy, as I have funding to migrate about 30 fisheries research databases to Postgis (from a commercial RDBMS) and I plan to make use of strk's Postgis topology capabilities to manage survey stratum creation & management.

This should all come together nicely...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PLUGIN_INSTALL CMake macro
Message-ID: <20121019232258.GA25555@gnash>

I've pushed a PLUGIN_INSTALL macro for use by the core python
plugins to specify files to be installed (now that I write this
I realize it could have been called PYTHON_PLUGIN_INSTALL).

The macro will generate an "install" rule to put the given list
of files in the final system destination _and_ a rule to always
install in the output/python/plugins/<plugin>/ at build time.
This is to allow full usage experience when running qgis from
the output dir (test before install).

Example usage:

 PLUGIN_INSTALL(db_manager . ${OTHER_FILES} ${PY_FILES} ${PYRC_FILES})
 PLUGIN_INSTALL(db_manager ui ${PYUI_FILES} ui/__init__.py)

Signature:

 PLUGIN_INSTALL(<plugin_name> <subdir> <list_of_files_to_install>)

I hope it'll help moving further with http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5879

I think you miss understand what is meant by saved expressions.  It
would only be the expression text that is saved in the project file
with maybe a name:

name : expression
name : expression
name : expression

when the expression builder is open we just look in the project and
read in the expressions into the tree on the left so the user can pick
from a pre-saved on.  Think of them as favourite expressions.

Saving with the layer isn't really that complicated as we already do
it for the qml files so the code is already all there just needs to be
tweaked for expressions.  Although I do see project based and
application wide expressions to be of more use then per-layer.

I'm really not a big fan of those back and forward buttons.  My idea
is to have a save button with three options:

Save as
- Application favourite
- Project favourite
- File

All just save out a key value pair of name : expression. The
application one is stored in the QSettings for QGIS, the project one
in the project file, and the File one writes a file out with name :
expression in the file.

When you open the expression builder it will load all the name and
expressions from QSettings and show them in the tree on the left in a
node called: Favourite Expressions (App wide).  It will then read the
project file and do the same but put them under: Favourite Expressions
(Project).  After that the user can then load an expression from the
file using the Load button much like the new Python console.

This way a user can open the expression builder and pick a saved
expression by name and it will be loaded into the expression text
area. When the user single clicks on the named expression the
expression text will be show in the help section on the right so that
the user can see what it is without loading it.

delimited text provider parses quoted strings as expected
whether you choose the "plain character" option.

The "Selected delimiters" instead uses a regular expression,
so it doesn't parse strings within quotes.

I don't know, I didn't tried with a such character within the
string, that wasn't the goal of my fix.

yes. My change doesn't improved the current behavior,
I just fixed the "plain character" option, now its code is
shared between the Add delimited text dialog and the
delimited text provider.

Ok, I guess I can fix it by making the "selected delimiters"
option working like the "plain character" option whether the
user chooses one delimiter only, but anyway it won't work
selecting more delimiters from the list.

How about saving expressions in a "Clipbook"?  An expression can be pasted
into a "Clipbook" which would also bring up a dialog to enter a name for
the expression.  Several "Clipbooks" can be created in order to organize
these saved expressions.  This would be handy in the Python console too.
Btw, this how the text editor called Textpad works.

If the saved expressions were 'named' (as you suggested, Nathan), it
would go a long way towards realizing better, extensible tokens in the
Print Composer [0].

The only difference would be the pasting of a token, based upon the
name and storage location (qgis, project, and possibly file; e.g.
[%qgis:mypagecount%] or [%prj:mycrstxt%] ) instead of the expression
itself being hard-coded into the label text (though that's already
much better than before, thanks Hugo).

It would be handy to embed tokens inside of tokens, i.e. named
sub-expressions inside of other expressions, but that might be getting
a bit crazy.  :^)

Allowing the user to edit, or at least overwrite, a saved named
expression would also be a useful feature.

Message-ID: <508279AF.9090106@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I noticed that in most plugins there is no separate licence file, and in many there
is no licence whatsoever.
I think this should be a requirement for accepting a plugin on the repo, and should
ask authors to fix this.
Any objection about establishing a standard way to add it (e.g. provide a LICENSE
file and put license header to all sources), and implement it?
All the best.

Great, Ii assume this solves the problem
Victor,
Will we have a new version of the Sextante plugin soon or do we have
to apply the patch ourselves?

Hi all.
This is part of the larger problem: how do we set up a core plugin release cycle
independent of that of master? Still do not have a clear solution.
I agree it would be important, especially for the fast-moving ones like sextante.
All the best.

Agustin,

There are a few importante changes since last version, but I would
like to close a couple of bugs before releasing a new version. The
patch, I will apply it today and it will be in the github repo.

In short, I guess you can count on a new version in less than a month
(there is not a well defined roadmap at the moment, but that is a good
estimate). If you want to always have the most recent version (with
unstable stuff as well...), using the github version is the
recommended way of doing it.

i understand the hassle, but from the point of view of R scripts in
Sextante this is not a bug, it is
that Sextante is totally unusable for this purpose. My intention was
to include this Sextante capability
within my (hopefully) forthcoming presentation on geospatial
capabilities of R in a R users meeting, (and have
been trying using it, see
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/R-scripts-for-raster-layers-in-External-Apps-of-the-Sextante-Toolbox-plugin-td4998046.html).
I will try the git thing (now that Ii know hot to use svn...), if I
find directions on how to do it.

Agustin

2 quick things:

1) I am going to prepare a document with instructions to use the
latest version from git. That might help you and others as well.

2)If you are doing a presentation about SEXTANTE, that puts you in my
list of "privileged" users :-) That means that you can (and you
should) ask me for direct help or to prepared a tailored version so
you have it ready for your presentation.

Anyway, do you have any deadline for that?. I am presenting SEXTANTE
at the Russian FOSS4G conference in mid november, and I should have a
new version ready by that time. In the meantime, as I said, and if you
do not manage to use git, I can send you just a zip file with changes
that affect the R engine in SEXTANTE, so you can just unzip them in
you QGis plugins folder and test them.

Regards

Victor

Hi Victor,
I also apply for this privilege ;)
I have just done a 3-days course on QGIS analyses, and obviously Sextante
featured prominently.
Moreover, I?m going to present what?s new and analytical capabilities of
QGIS in verious venues, including FOSS4G-jp.
The experience is generally positive, but several bugs are quite annoying,
and in general there is a feeling of a minefield, as we can never know
which command is going to work.
I?m with Tim here: having a nice test suite that just check if each module
gives an output would be of paramount importance for both usage and bugfix.
Even better when we?ll be able to check the validity of results, but simply
checking its presence would already be a big improvement (and probably not
too difficult to do, recursively for all backends and modules).
Obviously I?m ready to help.
All the best.

Victor,
If my abstract is accepted, my presentation will be on geospatial
capabilities of R, and I will devote a significant part on links to
GIS packages. manageR and Sextante are very important, as they
offer access to R from within a GIS platform. Obviously, I would like
to present them as operational tools.
If you recruit a team of beta testers for Sextante, you can count on
me to help testing the R part.
Let me know how to access to the doc on git that you are preparing as
soon as you have it ready, the meetings will be 15-16/11
Thanks
Agus

Agustin

Thanks for your help

I will write down how to use the git version so you can have a working
version to test

Once you get your scripts working (the ones you are trying now but do
not work), the best way to help us test things is to write your own
new scripts.

If they work...perfect. If not, we will try to fix them (and hopefully
on time for you meeting).

Thanks again for your help

Victor

you are already on top of the list :-)

I share that opinion. I can staat working out an automated test with
dummy values. This might work for most algorithms, but fail in some of
them. Those can then be adressed individually with tailored parameter
values. I think this is a good starting point.

Any recomendation about unit testing for QGIS plugins? Any plugin that
already has some good unit tests?

Thanks

Victor

Hi Victor,

Not sure if you know, but Tim did a short talk in Essen about python 
unit testing. You can view it here:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhRcvXvHUSg

Actually we were all encouraged to create at least one python unit test 
during this hackfest...

Hi Ale, all
I just tried to add Victor's new blog to [2] and noticed few "grave"
problems :/
from worse to least:
- login doesn't work for planet. on [3] I see logged in as mbernasocchi
and the logout link, I move to [1] and I see the login link and I can't
login. It takes me to the login page, I enter my pass, I get sent back
to [2] and the login link is still there.

- "About plugins" in the nav bar points to [1] which is the same as [2]
(the aggregator). Nothing to do with plugins.

- the page keeps on waiting for connecting to media.djangoproject.com

- A css issue solvable by changing 3px to 20 in #leftcolumn
padding-left: 20px;

- searching google for "qgis blog" or "qgis planet" always finds [4]
first (this has been mentioned before and it is really annoying. and
easy to solve for an admin, just put a redirect to [2] in [4]

thanks a lot, and if I can help let me know, I know my way around ssh
and serverish :)

Done. One issue: how can we cover the 100 km from the airport to the
venue? What are the options, and how much will this cost?
Thanks.

Options are listed here: 
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/9_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Valmiera_2013#Traveling-Riga-Valmiera-Riga
In one direction max 5 EUR.

As mentioned in WIKI - Depending from arrival time and participants from 
Riga we can try to organize some transportation also by car.

Very strange...

BTW solving the URLs mess will probably solve the login too.

Yes, we know, this must be fixed.

a redirect from planet.qgis.org to  plugins.qgis.org/planet whould probably do.

Maybe better to rename the main app to web.qgis.org  (or something
like that) and then have a couple of redirections or transparent
rewrites:
plugins.qgis.org ->  web.qgis.org/plugins
planet.qgis.org -> web.qgis.org/planet

etc. etc.

We can ask Werner to make the redirects with apache mod_rewrite.

no idea...

You could git pull & push the CSS fix, please always add a class
selector which applies to planet pages only otherwise you will
probably break other parts of the site (like happened in the past).

I can load the changes on the server when done.

the whole project is all on qgis-django on github.

Just to make it clear, I developed only the plugins.qgis.org part of
the site, all other stuff (planet, usermap apache config etc. etc.)
was done by someone else (who should probably take care of maintaining
and fixing it too).

Message-ID: <11FEFB79BB74EC488B17BFF8961A4E7B71EA72@mx.edisoft.pt>

Hi!

I developed a Quantum GIS plugin layer using Microsoft Visual studio and
placed it in my plugins folder of my customized quantum gis application.

I now intend to debug the DLL using Microsoft Visual Studio 10.

I have Quantum GIS 1.8 sources with debug information successfully
compile and also try to debug my dll using this environment without
success.

My question is: How can i debug a Quantum GIS DLL using Microsoft Visual
Studio 10?

Thank you

Marco

I don't have VS installed right now, but in the past I used to Debug
attaching to an external process. This is an option VS gives you in the
debugger configuration.
Let's say you start your built QGis and the systems assigns it PID XXXX.
Attach the VS debugger to that PID and you're done ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] #6535 Support WFS Post GetFeature Request in
	QGIS-Server - Review
Message-ID: <508573CB.2050402@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have created a branch on my github to implement the issue 6535 :
https://github.com/rldhont/Quantum-GIS/tree/6535
I supplied a patch on hub.qgis.org
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6535/

Because I updated the filter capabilities, I added spatial filter 
capabilities, I would like a review or test about my implementation.
I made test with OpenLayers and its WFS Protocol. I tested BBOX and 
Intersects, but I added Contains, Crosses, Disjoint, Equals, Overlaps, 
Touches and Within filter capability.

Marco, if you think I can merge or apply the patch, I'll do it.

Regards,
Ren?-Luc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Merging of incompatible changes
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfqjG-h6NMtwXV8BA=mzYbVMgap9H7CZcTxKfotPnbQBQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

recently I have been brewing some backwards incompatible API changes
that will 1) enable introduction of threading, 2) simplify API for
developers. I would like to merge the changes soon to master branch in
order not to drift too much from master.

The changes will break lots of plugins, if not all of them... as a
part of the changes I would like to switch PyQt4 to use to QString API
2 and QVariant API 2. Basically that means:
1. all QString instances will be automatically translated to 'unicode'
python type and vice versa.... e.g. layer.name() will return 'unicode'
instead of QString. This removes the headache from distinguishing
between QString and native string api in python plugins. It also
avoids the common error of converting QString to 'str' type which
represents 8-bit strings (Qt equivalent is QByteArray) and so there
should be fewer errors in plugins related to handling of international
characters.
2. QVariant instances from Qt are converted automatically... to get an
attribute of a feature, you would write feature[0] to get 'int'
instead of having to write f[0].toInt()[0] - definitely less clumsy.
Also let me note that the above mentioned API v2 are defaults in PyQt4
for Python3, so once we choose to move from Python v2 to v3 there will
be less porting necessary. For more details please refer to:
http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/static/Docs/PyQt4/html/incompatible_apis.html

In general this means with these changes we will split everything into
two worlds: 'legacy' (QGIS 1.x release) and 'future' (QGIS 2.x). Until
now you can run all (most) plugins for 1.x also on QGIS from master
branch - but that will definitely change. What I am worried about:
1. plugin repository - is it ready for QGIS 2.0? Is it possible to
keep a plugin in two branches of development: 1.x vs 2.x? Right now
you can distinguish just between stable/development version, right?
Maybe we should create another instance of the repository for plugins
for 2.x to keep them clearly separated?
2. python plugins in QGIS source repository - mainly SEXTANTE - we
will probably need to create a branch to allow continuous development
of the plugins for QGIS v1.x and then port them to master.
3. it will no longer be a good idea to recommend users to use qgis-dev
version because all the cool plugins they have downloaded will break
apart. But that's the cost of incompatible changes, right?

What do you think, any ideas?

Regards
Martin

Hi!

Short answer from me

+1 and go ahead .. As I remember we all knew that on the way to 2.0
there will be some API Changes - but as long as it improves QGIS at a
Project I see no Problem for it ..

The only thing you are worrying about are the Plugins .. but hey - there
is still 1.8 ..
And once all those changes settled in (upcoming) 2.0 - from my point of
view it would be time for a new release ..

Probably we should introduce a max.Version to plugins too? ;)

Anyway - all of your advantages sound good to me ..
What's the current plan for 2.0? Maybe we could do some "Sprint" in
Latvia and release 2.0 as a Party there?

regards
Werner

Great news! Looking forward to see this in master

I think we anyway will make this changes, so better to made this now.
Some plugins already not worked in QGIS master because of raster API
changes and if I remember correctly we already make announce that qgis-dev
is not recommended for most users.

Well, there is a 1.8.0 and previous qgis-dev builds

Why not mark plugins for 2.x as development?

Right, if we will continue with supporting backward compatibility we will
never see 2.0


So +1 from me and +1 from NextGIS

This sounds excellent. Are those newer APIs going to significantly
increase the base Qt version install requirement (like to 4.7)?

If the new APIs are to be used, maybe QGIS master (2.0) can use a
different plugins directory, e.g.

~/.qgis/python/plugins_v2

This would allow any version 2 plugin repository to be loaded into the
installer and work independent of any already installed <=1.8
versions. (Similarly, it might be a good idea to change the app name
for QSettings to ensure two different settings files, as well.) The
plugin installer for master could maybe also show (and note) plugins
from the 1.8 repository, so those plugins could be installed in the
plugins_v2 directory for testing/migration purposes.

Often with major API changes like this, it is very beneficial to offer
a 'sniffing' script that plugin authors can run statically on their
code to log line/column numbers (and maybe line content) for potential
areas of incompatibility. This might help authors move their plugins
to version 2 quicker, assuming such a script can be crafted. Maybe
Phil Thompson has some ideas?

agreed, this should solve most of the headaches.
I think we should advertise the breaking of the ddev version widely, as
many users (we spoiled them) have become accustomed to it, even in
production.
All the best, and thanks Martin!

Hello,

I can't find how avoid QGIS stores users logins and passwords from 
PostGis in the QGIS project.
If I add the PostGis layer manualy from the QGIS menu, if I disable the 
store user name and store password options, works corretly, the user and 
password don't are stored. But if I add the layer using pyqgis from a 
plugin, the information is stored, and I dont know how avoid that.

If I use this code:

         uri = qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI()
         uri.setConnection(host, port, database, usuario, password)

         # set database schema, table name, geometry column and 
optionaly subset (WHERE clause)
         nombres=nombreCompletoTabla.split(".")
         if len(nombres) < 2:
             raise Exception("Falta el nombre del esquema en el nombre 
de la tabla")
         esquema=nombres[0]
         tabla=nombres[1]

         uri.setDataSource(esquema, tabla, campoGeom, 
condicionSeleccion,campoGid)
         vlayer = qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), tabla, "postgres")
         if not vlayer.isValid():
             raise IOError, "Fallo al abrir la capa espacial"
         # add layer to the registry
         qgis.core.QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)

QGIS write that in the QGIS project:

             <datasource>dbname='propiedad' host=localhost port=5432 
user='usuario' password='xeiraaixo' key='gid' 
table="src25830"."elem_interiores" (geom) sql=id_trabajo in (select 
id_trabajo from comun.trabajos where 
municipio='12032;Borriana/Burriana')</datasource>


How can I avoid that from pyqgis?

Thank you for your time.

AFAIK this is impossible. QGIS needs this information to load layer.

 Hi,

 I don't know how this works from Python, but you can manually load 
 Postgis layers without storing the password in the project file (just 
 uncheck the store user/password in PostgreSQL checkboxes). But the 
 drawback is, that when you reopen the project it will ask you for the 
 password.

 Sorry, I don't know if you can also do this from Python.

Don't set username and password - otherwise they'll get saved.
But in that case QGIS will ask interactively for a the credentials via
QgsCredentials.  You might be able to avoid that using [1], before adding the

Hi All,
a user point of view: 
Go ahead, but advertise us! Thoses changes sound good. 
+ 1 for Larry's proposal of separating Qsettings versions, since we all
spend some time running 1.8 AND master on the same machine and same user ...

 Hi,

 For me it is ok to go ahead and break the API. That was our goal for 
 version 2.0.

 But perhaps we can especially mark the version before those big changes 
 in github and create a parallel version in OSGeo4W that still works. I 
 don't ask to work on two versions in parallel, just to keep a working 
 version around for those who already work with master and want to 
 continue using their improvements and plugins.

 J?rgen, can we organize a "frozen" parallel version in OSGeo4W before 
 the big breaks? We can remove it again, once the situation gets 
 stabilized in master.

 Andreas

 QgsDataSourceURI with spatialite connexion on addFeatures
Message-ID: <374F2A33A0F46242B3A1F52EB8A1E8B4E43EDE15B3@EXCHMBX-V.cg67.fr>

Hi,

Got more information about my problem (http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2012-October/019815.html) .
In my app I'm connecting twice to the same spatialite DB :
one to get layers ,

            uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
            uri.setDatabase( self.dirDBcanal )
            uri.setDataSource( "", layername, "GEOMETRY" )

one to get non-geographical data to display them into several Qt Widget,

        self.db = QtSql.QSqlDatabase.addDatabase("QSQLITE")
        self.db.setDatabaseName(self.dirDBcanal)
        self.db.open()

The problem occurs when I build a model to display information in a Qtableview :
        self.mdlAOT = QtSql.QSqlRelationalTableModel(self.aotGui, self.db)

If I bypass this code I can insert data with the provider, if not I can't

I've tried to enable Sqlite share-cache mode, but with no effect

      self.db.setConnectOptions("QSQLITE_ENABLE_SHARED_CACHE=1")

May-be do I have to the same for QgsDataSourceURI ? (QgsDataSourceURI. setParam function ? but what param ?)

Thanks

I think all changes should be made backward compatible unless the development
cost in doing so is higher than the development cost of upgrading all plugins.

Hi all,

I second Andreas with the idea of a frozen master version which is very 
usable for end-users who need the last improvements.

Greetings,

Denis

What problems are with settings? AFAIK new settings are added and old
may be left unused but settings meaning is not changed.

It may be a lot of work to copy all servers (W*S, databases) through GUI.

 users logins and passwords from PostGis

Message-ID: <50866A70.3060502@gmail.com>

Hello,

I can't find how avoid QGIS store users logins and passwords from
PostGis in the QGIS project.
If I add the PostGis layer manualy from the QGIS menu, if I disable the
store user name and store password options, works corretly, the user and
password don't are stored. But if I add the layer using pyqgis from a
plugin, the information is stored, and I dont know how avoid that.

If I use this code:

##############
	uri = qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI()
         uri.setConnection(host, port, database, usuario, password)

         # set database schema, table name, geometry column and
optionaly subset (WHERE clause)
         nombres=nombreCompletoTabla.split(".")
         if len(nombres) < 2:
             raise Exception("Falta el nombre del esquema en el nombre
de la tabla")
         esquema=nombres[0]
         tabla=nombres[1]

         uri.setDataSource(esquema, tabla, campoGeom,
condicionSeleccion,campoGid)
         vlayer = qgis.core.QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), tabla, "postgres")
         if not vlayer.isValid():
             raise IOError, "Fallo al abrir la capa espacial"
         # add layer to the registry
         qgis.core.QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(vlayer)

#########

QGIS write that in the QGIS project:

             <datasource>dbname='propiedad' host=localhost port=5432
user='usuario' password='xeiraaixo' key='gid'
table="src25830"."elem_interiores" (geom) sql=id_trabajo in (select
id_trabajo from comun.trabajos where
municipio='12032;Borriana/Burriana')</datasource>


How can I avoid that from pyqgis?

Thank you for your time.

Hello,

Thanks you for your answer,

I found the solution for my problem. Only need change the user and 
password params for "" value. QGIS ask that interactively only one time 
and loads all layers from PostGis.

         uri = qgis.core.QgsDataSourceURI()
         uri.setConnection(host, port, database, "", "")

No problem.

BTW please don't hijack threads - just saw your other mail which had roughly

I generally agree, I'm just worried about missing too many plugins along
the road, not being upgraded. To prevent this, IMHO we should:
- centralize all relevant plugins from local ones to the main hub
- help plugin devs, by providing them with scripts and howtos to make
upgrade easier.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <50869417.6030408@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
The discussion of this evening brought a nice idea: since we have many
different types of users, whi not having a "first usage wizard" that
simply asks the user which profile (s)he prefers, and then starts QGIS
with only the needed menus and buttons activated? The profiles can be
easily produced via the customization menu, so this seems trivial to
implement, and can greatly help first-time users and special interest
groups.
Of course we have to have a prominent menu to re-run the wizard, and
change the choice.
Opinions?
All the best.

Sounds like a good idea. Not too difficut to implement, but might help
first-time users to try a bit longer and not be intimidated at first
sight...

Hi Martin

In your changes, are there also other api-breaking things besides the 
Python changes ( related to 1) enable introduction of threading )?

I second Andreas too.

I'm currently finishing a project using 1.9-master because some
bugfixes like the ones for bug #6550 or in commit 32978fb4, so keeping
a version in OSGeo4W would be great for me, even if it is "frozen".

Message-ID: <CACH1WLCOcT=tL0BcU=x6Y_cYUcODa+867KqG3nyS=KxW755QPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

A connect() that works OK on 1.9-master for Linux fails in Windows
with this message:

    vLayer.geometryChanged.connect(self.onNodeGeometryChange)
TypeError: connect() failed between
geometryChanged(QgsFeatureId,QgsGeometry) and unislot()

The code looks like this:

    vLayer.geometryChanged.connect(self.onNodeGeometryChange)
    ...

  @pyqtSlot(int, QgsGeometry)
  def onNodeGeometryChange(self, featureId, geom ):

I am missing something or is there a specific issue on the Windows build?

I had a similar problem in Linux with QGIS 1.8 wich was solved
upgrading to master after being aware of commit 32978fb4
(http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/repository/revisions/32978fb4e9a6b115bed3245a90c4c038ed3fb04c)

Hi Marco

yes there are (will be) also other changes, mainly:
- QgsVectorLayer + QgsVectorDataProvider: select(), nextFeature(),
rewind(), featureAtId() replaced by getFeatures(), feature request and
feature iterator classes
- QgsFeature + QgsField: attributes are stored in a vector instead of
a map (for more efficient access).

That means everyone who does something with vectors is affected (c++
or python). At some point I will start preparing a porting guide.

I agree with Radim. We can use the same QSettings - it should have the
benefit of keeping the settings for both versions in sync.

In order to support QGIS 1.x and 2.x plugins simultaneously we just need:
- a new section in QSettings to store which plugins are active in v2.x
- a new directory e.g. ~/.qgis/python/plugins2 to store user-installed
plugins for v2.x
- a new URL for plugin installer to fetch plugins for v2.x
Like this, it should be possible to run either version of QGIS without
getting messages about broken plugins etc.

Since QGIS 1.0 released on January 2009 (nearly four years ago!) we
have been maintaining API compatibility - even at a cost of slightly
weird situations like having two vector rendering engines and two
labeling engines. But after some time it is necessary to remove old
stuff in order to keep moving forward. We realize that plugin authors
may not like the changes in API, but without that we simply cannot
improve the core libraries. The core dev team is small compared to the
community of plugin developers.

I am just afraid that with such profiles the users may forget after a
while they have chosen a "first-time user" profile that disables a lot
of functionality and then users will ask/complain about missing
features...?

btw. Personally I'm quite intimidated by the amount of toolbars and
icons that QGIS shows by default (i.e. first run). I think if we could
cut that down to a one line of icons, that will be a good start.

-1 from me.
This is against the release plan we agreed on the hackfest.

IMHO, current master can be a great 2.0 release with many new features in a 
few months.
Your additions are the begin of the next level - an even greater 3.0 release.

So I would strongly prefer to have these changes in a "plugin-ng"-branch 
instead of starting a "frozen" 1.9 branch.

Pirmin

Please can you be more specific about what has been planned at the
hackfest? What should get into 2.0 and what not? I had the impression
there was no roadmap for 2.0.

I am afraid that postponing those changes to 3.0 will essentially need
redoing all the changes again from scratch for 3.0 - master branch is
a quickly moving target.

But who will maintain that branch? I do not have enough free time to
keep a separate branch up-to-date with master for a long period (until
3.0)

Also given that we do a release around every six month, or so, it will
be a long while before we ever see a 3.0.  The API is already broken I
think we should get it all done with now and move on.  Once we release
2.0 we are locked to that API for a long time and threading will be a
no go.

Hi all.
I think we should be extremely careful on this choice, as it has the
potential for disrupting our otherwise rather smooth path. Many other
software got stuck in the middle of breakages like this. I think we
should avoid like hell remaining in the middle of the transition, with
half of the things working well in one version, and the other half much
better in the other. The proposed one is a much welcomed change, and it
is naturally risky.
So, in short, I think we should have a detailed plan about timing for
core development and on how to migrate all relevant plugins.
All the best.

sure - the first natural candidates are all the "load
vector|raster|etc." buttons, as the same functionality is in the
browser: what do we miss if we remove them now?

Totally agree, it was widely announced that 2.0 _will_ break api
comptibility. We need to us this rare oppurtunity to really make big
cleanups.

Gidday from down under...

FWIW, when we commissioned Quantum Map
(https://www.niwa.co.nz/software/quantum-map, one initial objective was to create a less intimidating GUI for first time users. 

We based this on potential user's feedback & the GIS users pyramid (described with a very ESRI centric perspective here http://www.directionsmag.com/articles/gis-nostalgia-at-the-base-of-the-gis-pyramid/123099 )

but essentially:
????? /??????? \
???? /create\
??? / ? edit??? \
?? / analyse? \
? /? visualise? \

ie: the bottom (largest) tier of real or potential GIS users just want to see their data as a map (layer) on a screen. Maybe query features. Some want to analyse data, & the GIS professionals tend to do most of the data creation. Of course, some users move up the pyramid with experience (& some don't fit the model at all :-)

>From our perspective this has been very successful, Quantum Map does simple things simply, & if you like, provides a stepping stone to QGIS if people are ready to use the extra capability.

So I think the idea of selectable profiles to enable a simple default & add (unhide) capability when you are ready for it is a good idea. Going beyond the existing selectable menus, to a list of user levels, rather than explicit functionality. 

What do the terms "Digitising" & "Advanced digitising" mean to inexperienced GIS users? It is confusing at best, intimidating at worst. 

Ahhh, the simple days of QGIS 0.2 as my primary desktop mapping tool!? :-)

Message-ID: <CAO4ZAE1+bnvzDyoRcbecOvX=pk1HkAeRk7v6kk5JTOxfTpj1DQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello QGIS Devs,

Greetings. I posted this question at GIS Stackexchange didn't get any
fruitful response.

I would like to setup keyboard shortcuts for GPS data capture with QGIS in
the field.

In the GPS Information dialog box,

I want to add shortcuts  for these

 "Add Point" - Key "P" (Any combination with ALT or CTRL etc)

"Add feature"  - Key "F"

and "Add track point" - Key "T"

Later, I can use a programmable Mouse such as CM Storm Sentinel Advance II
mouse with my Windows 7 laptop.

I would be grateful if you show me how to do it.

I appreciate your time.

Thanks, Thiru

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Joining tables without geometries,
	version 1.7.1 vs. 1.8.0.1
Message-ID: <007c01cdb191$41e17000$c5a45000$@com>

Dear list

 

I try to relate the attached two lists (Measurement and Parameters) using
their primary and foreign keys (attributes PK and FK_*). The definition of
the columns are attached as well in the *.csvt files.

Using the table properties -> Joins I define the relation between the two
tables.

 

As soon as I click the OK on the property form of the table, QGIS 1.8.0.1
crashes. The crash is replicable by using *.xls files and PostGIS tables
(without geometries) as well.

 

I Checked the same dataset with the version 1.7.1 and it works without any
problems.

 

Well, it seems that between 1.7.1 and 1.8.0.1 something basic changed in the
table handling. Is someone aware of a workaround as a short term solution?

 

Looking forward,

Yvo

Yes, I can see why you might want to offer some default "profiles" to control which toolbars and panels are visible, but I don't think it is a good idea to use the customisation feature to hide any functionality.

Me too.  I'm more of an enthusiast than a frequent user, but I imagine the features most users would need to use frequently are on the "navigation", "digitizing" and "attributes" toolbars, so you would probably get away with showing only these by default.

I'm not too sure about the panels - maybe just "layers"?  Or "layers" and "overview"?

I think there might be a ticket with a discussion of this, too... or maybe there was just a previous discussion on the mailing list.

Hi Paolo,

I think Matplotib package is not install in by default in any other
system. You have to download and install it by yourself.

Anyway, you can download in Willam's site (below) and install it very
easily in Mac OS X.

http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/python

The package works as well for Mountain Lion.

Yes, the long row of "add layer" buttons is the most prominent
candidate. The idea is to merge all the buttons into one and offer
unified load layer dialog that would contain the browser tree +
provider specific options. Nathan has produced some mockups how this
could look like... Now we just need someone to implement that :-)

The browser tree dock widget is a good thing, but it cannot replace
the add layer dialog completely as it is missing some power when it
comes to provider-specific options - select ID of a postgis view,
select style of a WMS layer or open a CSV layer...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] again on encoding problems
Message-ID: <5087962C.9010904@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Here in the Far East the encoding is a serious problem hampering the use
of QGIS.
I was just pointed out a problem with the GRASS plugin on Win:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4547
and the solution the use:
http://osgeo-org.1560.n6.nabble.com/Qgis1-5-Grass-tt3730164.html#a3730165
basically they set up the entire environment in EN, but this is not
optimal, as the translation is actually there, as we can see e.g. on osx
and of course on Linux.
It looks a very simple problem, anybody has an idea on how to solve it
more elegantly?
All the best, and thanks.

ok, thanks a lot for this. Still, I think it should be included in the

wouldn't it be better to add this to the browser, instead of having (one
more) double solution?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] setPkgDataPath issue
Message-ID: <20121024072254.GA3817@gnash>

Larry, I commented out the setPkgDataPath line because with
that load of GdalTools plugin out of output/python/plugin path
fails with this message:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "/usr/src/qgis/Quantum-GIS/b/output/python/qgis/utils.py", line 188, in startPlugin
     plugins[packageName] = package.classFactory(iface)
   File "/usr/src/qgis/Quantum-GIS/python/plugins/fTools/__init__.py", line 53, in classFactory

which seems to mean that the startPlugin function, loaded from output dir,
finds the __init__.py file in the _source_ dir rather than finding the one
in output dir. 

The same kind of error happens with _all_ the plugins, not only GdalTools.

I understand from your commit log that something else broke without that line,
can we find another way to fix it ? Can you explain what the problem was ?
I don't know what "crssync" is...

Hi, 
Browser needs at least 3 improvements to get reed of an extra button:
 1- ability to reorder folders and files by name or  date. If sometimes have
seen mixed up folders in browser, without knowing why...
 2- ability to connect ("mount") a shortcut to a location like in Arcmap.
This is because data can be stored in very long folders tree, to large for
browser panel. Navigation becomes quickly uncomfortable.  
Thoughts ?

In addition to what we discussed on irc, i.e. why that setPkgDataPath
call should stay as is, it sounds more like an issue with sys.path. If
the interpreter is finding modules in the source directory before
output, maybe prepend the staged output dir to sys.path, so it is
always searched before the source dir.

So what was the conclusion about threading? I had to leave HF during
the discussion but my impression was that threading was marked as
important and it should go to 2.0. If Martin is finally willing to
merge threading we should support him. The threading branch (the
knowledge) could also be lost during the years until the 3.0 release.

Is there the 2.0 changes list written on flip chart on HF somewhere on
wiki? If not, I'll start one. Is there a photo?

I checked sys.path and it does NOT contain the source dir at all.

Did you try to load python plugins from output/bin/qgis ?
With and without the setPkgDataPath ?
Because with the call they don't load, without they load.

The same applies with the console, too:

In browser, we cannot choose the encoding of e.g. Shapefiles. At least
when opened directly from Zip, German Umlaute are always messed up.

While it sounds like a good idea I think the browser falls short on a
few usability issues that I think having a separate diolog for would
resolve.

      - No sorting (how would you sort a tree of items?)
      - expanding a item with a large count of subitems now means I
have to scroll up and down to find other folders/connections
      - Limited room in the UI
      - Tree views become a pain to use if they become to large

I like the browser dock as a quick shortcut to load layers but I don't
think it should replace a good open layer dialog.  The open layer
dialog that I did a mockup of does use a tree view but it's only for
the top level items like connections and the layers are shown in the
right hand side.

Hello Paolo,
I haven't seen how QGIS GRASS plug in is built, still my 0.02 from
GRASS side. Some time a go I investigated encoding problems in native
GRASS on Windows (WinGRASS) and my conclusion was - it is not possible
to fix it for GRASS 6 due to character encoding handling in Windows.
Reason was simple - there's no single coding to cover all use cases in
Windows (CLI has one system (OEM), GUI has it's legacy system (ANSI)
and add to all also Unicode in more recent code). As GRASS strings
might come in all three encodings, unless the source of string is
known, it's impossible to convert/display string correctly.

Somebody with greater QGIS part can correct me, if I'm wrong (as I
would like to be :) ).

Maris.

Hi!

Probably I missed something in Essen but to my knowledge it was always
clear that 2.0 will have _a lot of API Changes_ .. And I missed them
already. So now someone (Martin) is starting to bring us to a point
where a 2.0 really earns its big number change.
I am really looking forward to have threading (and a lot of other
things that makes the 2 a real 2) included.

For the "frozen" release .. well .. What about keeping the last
"nightly" version before martins changes as a package on the page? -
Will not change anything about the current situation and will keep
people able to do their work (personally I do not expect that Martin's
changes will break whole QGIS and I also expect that the most
important and used plugins will get adjusted soon).
Waiting for a 3.0 is probably way too long for such important changes
and Martin would have to do his work a third time again ..

As I already know the great community around the project - I am sure
we will manage it somehow to keep the release straight.. with an even
greater, faster and better QGIS 2.0.
What about an real Roadmap? And a more or less aimed date to release
2.0? Is there already anything like that? I think that would probably
focus the aim

kind regards
Werner

There is also something else to remember here.  These changes that
Martin is proposing to merge are not the threading changes, it is the
API to allow threading to be added later.  Even without threading
being added the API update is worth it.  Having a cleaner API is
always a good thing.

Cleaner APIs == Happy developers

Hi!

my 2? regarding profile.

I personally find the Interface crowded with far too many icons. The
big problem I see is that for every person working with QGIS other
icons(functions) are important to have directly clickable available.
That leads me to the question I shortly discussed with Tim at the
Hackfest in Essen.

What about providing only basic functions to the user (Like I assume
it was meant by Martin) AND provide some kind of "create your own
toolbars". I think it's overhead to give an iconspace on the
mainscreen to every plugin you install which leads to more space
crowded by icons than real "workspace". Keep it simple and let the
user easily choose his own (one ore more) toolbars.
Probably some kind of question while installing a plugin would be
"Would you like to add an icon for this plugin to the main workspace?"
and then poping up the (to be created) "toolbar adding" tool.
I hope my explanation is not too complicated and you all know what I mean.
I think that would save a lot of space (adding new functions _only_ to
menu and not automatically adding a icon to the screen) and let the
User choose.

kind regards
Werner

Hi All, 
As Martin asked, could we know more about 2.0 roadmap planning and feature
list? 
My concern is that we deployed QGIS in prod for 300 users, but we still miss
some bugfixes and features to definitly switch. As long as I maintain two
GIS solutions, I have double work, and I can't dedicate more time to QGIS. 
I would like to support prioritary issues before feature freeze. In the
other hand, I can't wait until end of 2013 to fix 1.8 issues (raster print
KO.. for example). We also just supported, with others of you, great tools
like Atlas.. If a stable version with it is not released within a year,
users will start to get annoyed, and will tend to use master for production
use.. which is not a good target for any of us.

So what is the community plan?
What should we do as users and sponsors?  Should we ask (and support) a 1.8
bugfix release if 2.0 target moves again? Should we support a 1.9 release
for 2013 spring, and let major API changes for 2.0 be planned to end of
2013?  Does community have enough ressources to release a 1.9?

Please tell us, we love QGIS and its community.. but we also like very much
stability and visibility (and the captive users in my corp' too)
R?gis

 Hi Pirmin and others,

 Tim should correct me - but as far as I remember we said that threading 
 support is one of the major things we want to see in QGIS 2.0 (along 
 with raster redesign, atlas printing and others). But none of us were 
 sure in what timeframe Martin can work on it and when it will be 
 finished. Therefore we decided not to make it a blocker.

 We also decided that the geometry refactoring (for arcs, splines, 
 z-values, m-values, multitype geometries, etc.) should be done after 
 QGIS 2.0. I am not sure if this would again mean API breaks ...

 So I am against postponing the multithreading work and I had the 
 impression that this was the conclusion of others as well.

 Andreas

Well, my own reasoning is mostly that I don't like lots of duplication, it just bloats packages for a small convenience.  QGIS package is 75MiB, Matplotlib is 53MiB.  I don't do a standalone package any more because there were problems (although now fixed I think) and of all the shared parts (GDAL, SQlite, python stuff, ...) are useful on their own (but only useful to QGIS in a standalone) and to other packages like GRASS, MapServer and PostGIS.

Also, when QGIS 1.8 was released, certain plugins were not rewritten to use it yet.

My 2 cents.
I agree with all of you about the need to remove some default toolbars.
Following the proposal of Werner, what about having a "View" menu, where
the user can choose which toolbars activate and not? And as an improvement
to this, one could provide a system to "Add custom buttons" to the toolbar
space.

I knew that toolbars are already able to be switched on and off.. My
intention was to create those custom toolbars because currently you can
switch whole bars on and off.. But what if I use only one tool from a huge
bar?..
So I tend to keep the default small.. And create my own toolbar..

Invert color was missing in pseudocolor renderer, fixed. The question
is what is it expected to do. I have used
      red = 255 - red;
      green = 255 - green;
      blue = 255 - blue;
which is used for multiband color (both master and 1.8) but in 1.8
pseudocolor red and blue were switched instead.

You are probably expecting the classification to be done in reverse order?

I think that invert color has little/no sense for pseudocolor and
multiband color as it is implemented in master or/and was in 1.8. For
pseudo color it should be moved to "Generate new color map" options,
for multiband color just removed.

In any case, legend is not correct if invert color is used.

Hi defs

Yes, the decision was that multithreading branch should be in 2.0. 
Personally, I'm in favor of merging it as soon as possible (to give the 
dev team enough time to get used to the new classes and to handle 
possible side effects). Martin, is your planned merge already the full 
threading branch merge or a part of it?

Pathon changes: I don't have a strong opinion here, but most people on 
the list seem to be in favor of them ( they are not afraid to adapt 
their plugins for 2.0).

 >We also decided that the geometry refactoring (for arcs, splines, 
z-values, m-values, multitype >geometries, etc.) should be done after 
QGIS 2.0. I am not sure if this would again mean API breaks ...

I think that can wait until version 3...

Regards,
Marco

I'm waiting for Tim dropping into the discussion as well... In Essen, we 
decided against integrating major new features (like multithreading) into the 
next release. We did decide filling the missing gaps to fully replace old 
symbology and old labelling (Paolo: Kickstarter pledge on the way?) and 
polishing the many new features already integrated.

We already have some API breaks. I've spent quite some time in Essen to get a 
full list of it:
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20#Full-diff
My estimation is, that about 1% of all existing plugins are affected by the 
API changes in the current master branch. So we're talking of about 2 of 160 
plugins in the central repo and maybe 160 of 16'000 unpublished user plugins 
(any better estimation than 1:100 between published and unpublished plugins?).
Martins proposed API change means we break 160 of 160 and 16'000 of 16'000 
plugins. It will take years to bring them all in sync with QGIS again.

And we're not only talking about plugins. We're talking about a possible 2.0 
release with WMTS, WFS-T, huge raster improvements including performance 
factor 4 with PNG/8, Atlas printing, Sextante and minor things like fixed 
Shapefile support in Q1/2013. The other option is a new QGIS with release date 
far in 2014 and a giant gap between users working with QGIS 1.7.4, 1.8++ and 
developers working on a new QGIS and releasing plugins in a separate 
repository. Companies like ours will get paid for maintaining branches for 
customers who need stable and compatible releases. There will be 1.8 custom 
branches with backported fixes/features and a garanteed non-frozen 1.9 branch. 
I will remind Marco in 2014 of his +1 when he's still compiling QGIS 1.8 and 
investing a lot of time backporting fixes to a single-threaded version. I 
would very much prefer let him work on *new* features, which are a profit for 
*all* users, like in recent years.

We are on a developer list here. As a developer I like the proposed changes 
very much. QGIS is made by developers, but is also made for users. And 
sometimes we should care about users - even the 99% Windows users. That's why 
I'm voting for a polished 2.0 release in a few month with the great feature 
set we already have.

Regards
Pirmin

I would be more conservative with such estimates, maybe 500 plugins
altogether? But that's not really important for the discussion.

I understand your concerns - but I can imagine that if the API changes
are postponed to QGIS 3.0, in three years there will be five times
more plugins and therefore several times more code that would need
updating. So will we again shift the changes to QGIS 4.0 in order to
not break them?

My point is that there will be always push from users not to break
anything - and we need to decide at some point to do the necessary
cleanup and do not postpone it forever.

What about other changes, like removal of old symbology and old
labeling? Those will also break many plugins...

Martin

Hi Marco

First I would like to merge API changes that are required in order to
get threaded rendering in place. I am trying to write unit tests so
hopefully there won't be many regressions. After that I will be
reintroducing threaded rendering. In case that we would find out that
threaded rendering is not ready for prime time, it should be easy to
disable it in order not to wait with 2.0 release just for it... so we
should be still able to ship 2.0 sometime in spring/summer 2013 with
or without threading.

Sorry, no progress on this. I've asked for some feedback and help, got
none. Very little time now, planning to do it ASAP. Any help welcome.

I understand both Pirmin and Martin concerns. I think seriously breaking
the API and all the plugins will be good *if* we have a serious plan on
how to migrate the plugins. At this stage, we cannot afford releasing a
2.0 without plugins, as nobody will use it, and we'll get stuck in the
middle of the transition. This had proved to be a major problem for many
software, sometimes effectively killing it, and we should really
seriously avoid them.
I think it is realistic, on the basis of the response to the request to
move plugins to the new infrastructure, to assume that many developers
will not do the migration in time: are we willing and capable of
upgrading them ourselves, or do we plan to leave them as such?

+1: let's release ASAP.
Please note that, as said in Essen, we can start preparing for a 3.0
release as soon as 2.0 is out, no need to wait years for that.

One side note: current stable version is basically unusable as a default
for all double-byte-characters people (> half of the world population).
The needed change is trivial, a new release could fix this easily.

All the best.

In the region I'm working in (Southeast Asia), QuantumGIS' adoption rate is
quickly rising, in big part due to fact that ArcGIS doesn't properly
support UTF-8.

Keeping these new adopters passionate about QGIS - as well as increasing
user base - with an healthy release cycle is IMO really important. There
are so many good new features that have been pushing into 1.9, kind of
hurts to think it won't be available to a larger crowd until mid 2013.

One way forward would be to put official 2.0 milestones out. For e.g.,
before merging the threading work, it might be good to release a QGIS 2.0
beta 1 to the public. There are net advantages in doing so:
- Prevents long period of inactivity in-between official release for those
who do not want to work with nightly builds
- By making a more accessible development build (i.e. more people will
download a standalone "beta" installer than a nightly build), you'll get
more feedback and users testing the code
- Easing pressure of releasing a new QGIS version, giving more time for dev
plans

QGIS would go from two to three flavors: i) official version, ii) beta
version, iii) day-to-day dev build.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 'cubic' resambling for "zoomed in" (scale > 100%)
 rasters creates undesired visual glitches
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=qNHwR_abmV2yY1e_kWMqbB2jt5xKHyazHvGmXjuyLDkA@mail.gmail.com>

Steps to reproduce visual glitches:

1. Load a raster; for the sake of this example, please use 1:10m ocean
bottom available @
http://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-raster-data/10m-ocean-bottom/as
it shows this issue quite well
2. In the layer property window, retrieve the min/max values of RGB bands
with these settings:
(*) cumulative count cut 2 - 98%
(*) Full (extend)
(*) Estimate (faster) (accurary)
3. Set contrast enhancement to "Stretch to MinMax"
4. Set zoomed in resampling to "Cubic"
5. Apply the change, then zoom in (raster zoom scale must be > 100% to
activate cubic resampling) a region of the raster (if using the above ocean
bottom raster, glitches easily to spot in southern china sea, among other
places)

You'll notice weird visual glitches which are not there if using the two
other types of resambling. I'm attaching a screenshot of the problem [1].

Here is my train of thought:

If there was a system of different profiles, I imagine they should be task oriented, e.g. "raster analysis" or "hydrological modelling" (rather than "view", "edit" and "analyse" or "beginner", "expert" and "master of the known universe").

If the profiles used the "customisation" mechanism, they would not just control which toolbars and panels are on or off by default, they would control which toolbars are actually visible in the right-click menu and able to be turned on or off there.
As well as hiding toolbars and panels, it is natural that specific menu entries and toolbar buttons would be hidden in each profile, and when a user needed a specific feature they would need to switch through several profiles looking to see if it existed, or alternatively look for it in the customisation dialog and enable it there (which would kind of defeat the purpose of the profiles).  Essentially the hidden features would be a lot less discoverable.

How would the default profiles work with user customisations (including the user simply turning a toolbar on or off)?  When a user switches to a different profile, would their own customisations be automatically saved to the first profile?  Would they be prompted to save the changes to a new custom profile?  Is this complication really necessary?

If the menus are organised into a nice logical hierarchy (as they should be), shouldn't it be easy for people to find the features they need, and shouldn't there be no need to hide features to protect people from them, because people naturally won't go into the parts of the menu that contain the features they don't need?

Does QGIS really need a system of standard profiles?  Will that actually address the things that are bothering people?  Or are other fixes or improvements required to address these?
e.g.:
- make the "customisation" feature actually capable of hiding buttons in the plugin toolbar.
- make "customisations" apply without a restart (I presume this already works on systems, otherwise I don't know what the "apply" button would be for).
- make it possible for users to create extra toolbars, and even drag-and-drop buttons between different toolbars.
- gui cleanups like the famous unified add layer dialog.

When is "on time"?
Is it "before 2.0 is released"?
When people use software like Firefox they are accustomed to a lot of extensions becoming "incompatible" if they upgrade to a new version when it is released.  In that case there is seldom any real benefit associated with the upgrade.  But the threading is a major performance improvement, which is worth breaking compatibility isn't it?  And people have been eagerly anticipating it for years already...

Would you assume that most of those developers who have migrated their plugins to the new infrastructure will also update them for API changes?
Wouldn't that mean there isn't much of a problem, because whichever plugins won't be updated aren't available to users in the repository, anyway? ;)

Or has someone now migrated a significant number of unmaintained plugins to the new infrastructure?  If so, how many?

Hi Alistair,

My QGIS setup has 4 toobars across the top of the screen.? If I introduce someone to that, who is not familiar with GIS, their eyes glaze over... one lost potential user. Multiplied several times.

Is QGIS intended to be used by everyone, from novices to GIS experts?
It does not do that well at present (IMHO) hence our significant investment in the simpler Quantum Map application.

The current toolbars/menus are confusing. Related tasks are not obviously grouped together - the feature select tool is a critical part of digitising, but the icon is in a different menu... which is confusing and not that logical.

QGIS became popular because it could be downloaded & used by almost anyone. The enhancements from v1.0 to now are a fantastic step forward, and bring QGIS to a huge range of more expert users, but at the expense of the traditional ones. I'm sure the current flexible toolbar options can be enhanced to provide a QGIS which can be set up a a simple to learn & use mapping tool, to a bioinformatics or hydrological, etc, GIS workstation.

Having dockable toolbars, which users can add & remove icons to/from, & with icons able to be added to multiple toolbars would allow? a range of "interface settings", simple, mapping, vector editing (digitising), etc, but also a hydrological, etc toolbar. Plugins could be added to whatever toolbar the user required, to meet their needs.

I don't see how adding this capability makes using QGIS harder for anyone, especially if it can be installed with several initial example configurations to choose from. 

Perhaps the user could manage a set of toolbars (create/delete/edit) and can add whatever icons (tools) they want to any toolbar.

Plugins are added as types of tools, & can be added to toolbars. Having an interface to manage tools & toolbars creates a facility which it is very hard to hide tools or functionality, if well implemented. Tool metadata cold be supported, so users could search for "hydrological:, or "digitising" to find a list of those available.
Any configuration could be saved & reloaded (even uploaded to an online repository of QGIS GUI congigurations, much like plugins...)


Or does something along these lines not have wide appeal? 

Cheers,

? Brent Wood

Here is my train of thought:

If there was a system of different profiles, I imagine they should be task oriented, e.g. "raster analysis" or "hydrological modelling" (rather than "view", "edit" and "analyse" or "beginner", "expert" and "master of the known universe").

If the profiles used the "customisation" mechanism, they would not just control which toolbars and panels are on or off by default, they would control which toolbars are actually visible in the right-click menu and able to be turned on or off there.
As well as hiding toolbars and panels, it is natural that specific menu entries and toolbar buttons would be hidden in each profile, and when a user needed a specific feature they would need to switch through several profiles looking to see if it existed, or alternatively look for it in the customisation dialog and enable it there (which would kind of defeat the purpose of the profiles).? Essentially the hidden features would be a lot less discoverable.

How would the default profiles work with user customisations (including the user simply turning a toolbar on or off)?? When a user switches to a different profile, would their own customisations be automatically saved to the first profile?? Would they be prompted to save the changes to a new custom profile?? Is this complication really necessary?

If the menus are organised into a nice logical hierarchy (as they should be), shouldn't it be easy for people to find the features they need, and shouldn't there be no need to hide features to protect people from them, because people naturally won't go into the parts of the menu that contain the features they don't need?

Does QGIS really need a system of standard profiles?? Will that actually address the things that are bothering people?? Or are other fixes or improvements required to address these?
e.g.:
- make the "customisation" feature actually capable of hiding buttons in the plugin toolbar.
- make "customisations" apply without a restart (I presume this already works on systems, otherwise I don't know what the "apply" button would be for).
- make it possible for users to create extra toolbars, and even drag-and-drop buttons between different toolbars.
- gui cleanups like the famous unified add layer dialog.

Hi

I understand Paolos and Pirmins concerns. Software like kde4 or gvsig 
had or still have a long time of problems with major new versions. On 
the other hand, I don't want to postpone the threading changes again and 
again.
Would it be an option to branch a 1.9 from current master just before 
Martin merges the first breaking changes? That way, there would be a 
version with all the nice 1.9 features and very little API breaks (and 
99% of the plugins working). Plus the shapefile encoding fix.
I remember though that the 1.9 option was shortly discussed in Essen and 
the release team was not very pleased about it. I can't remember the 
exact reasons, maybe it is worth to reconsider?

Regards,
Marco

Thanks maris.
Are grass dev aware of the problem? Could we then display grass in English when on windows, for these languages?
 It seems important.
 All the best.

 Hi,

 This could be a solution. Release 1.9 this year (potentially a 
 Christmas present) with the new features we have now and then 2.0 in 
 summer or autumn 2013. We could do the feature freeze of 1.9 quite soon.

-1, of course let's release ASAP, but without creating future problems.

And break the API again? The API should be stable at least 5 years
IMO. Postponing the vector API change to 3.0 means just pushing the
problems we have to solve anyway to future. We have already broken
API, if we know that a new important feature cannot be implemented
without an additional API change, such change should be done in 2.0
(especially if it is ready to be merged and there is a person willing
to do that).

As Martin wrote, multithreading may be easily disabled in case of
problems but the API should be ready for it, I believe.

I see three alternatives:

1) Refuse vector API break in 2.0, release 2.0 (with non vector API
break and plugins broken) hopefully in spring 2013,  start immediately
work on 3.0 with vector API break, release  3.0 (with multithreading
and vector API break and plugins broken again) in 2014-2015.

2) The same as 1) but postponing 3.0 release to 2018 (to avoid
breaking API and plugins too often).

3) Accept vector API break in 2.0, release 2.0 (with API break and
plugins broken) in spring 2013 (possibly with disabled threading in
case of problems).

My favourite is 3).

Very bad idea IMO. That would result exactly in what we don't want:
having multiple broken versions with different (not) working features
available in each one. Again the same problem with breaking API twice,
not enough resources to concentrate on both 1.9 and 2.0 etc.

Hi all,

I don't know if somebody already brought up this (the discussion is
already rather long), but is there no possibility for including legacy
methods?

For the iterators this would probably mean, that there is a reserved
iterator running single-threaded for any calls to the old API.

I don't know what would be necessary to make a legacy string API.

This would bring us the benefits we need and leave old plugins running
(probably throwing out lots of big fat red warnings).

Regards,
Matthias

I also think 1.9 isn't a good idea.
Rather if there's some manpower, a 1.8.1 would be nice, to fix any
bad bug which is preventing users from staying in 1.8...

sounds reasonable. so, our main problem seems to plugin breakage.
I suggest we build a task force to fix the broken plugins in time for
2.0, in case plugin devs are lazy. Of course I'm talking of plugins in
the new webapp, not others.
How much work would it be?
All the best.

And instead of API cleanup add new deprecated calls? I prefer to break
API once and then live next 4-5 years with new shiny stable API.

If we postpone Martin's changes to 3.0 number of plugins will grow
and fixing all of them will require more time and manpower than now.

IMO QGIS really needs threading support, rendering is slow even in
compare with ancient ArcView 3.2

That's what I mean. There would be nobody preventing you from using the
new API while the old one would not be broken. So the breakage would
still only happen once, after giving the dev's some time to port their
plugins and keep the user from the frustration that all their plugins
are suddenly broken.
What are the downsides? I'm more worried if it's really possible

I agree on both points.

Hi,

Is there something as the "good" choice given the limited workforce 
available ?
Is the release's multiplication a good choice ? It has already been 
tried...

The frequent feedback I get from institutions using QIGS is that they 
want :
- bugfixes but no new functionalities
-> but new "useful" functionalities (just for their specific use cases 
of course)
- less frequent release to ease the software validation and their 
internal documentation process
-> but a faster, better, cleaner software

Hard to conciliate ! Even without a multithreaded 2.0 these companies 
will be asking backported bugfixes as described by Pirmin.

Multithreading has been waiting on the side for years, I recall showing 
the 1.5 multithreaded branch ! Now Martin is able to finally start 
getting it back in trunk, this task isn't postponable as it would 
depends on his future availability and it would be complicated by all 
the master changes done during this time.

The API is already broken, the segmentation of the work will just make 
the migration of the plugins longer. If a plugin is not ported to the 
cleaner and simpler API, it should be considered as unmaintained. Should 
the project slows its pace for fear of unusable obsolete extensions ? 
ESRI has made the choice of killing their gigantic Visual Basic plugin 
base, MapInfo MapBasic is often breaking compatibility, etc. so this 
kind of situation is not unknown by all our "big" users. The difference 
is that they pay for licenses.

 +1 for a spring or mid 2013 release of 2.0 with API break + plugin task
force. I was afraid that API change could lead to end 2013. 

I would be please to support such an effort. I agree we need multithreading
enabled, and a polished API. But I remember the amount of effort needed to
release a version without blocker like in 1.7.1-1.7.3 period.
Of course we have a test environnement now, but, 1.9 have so many new
features... and still very blocking issues without a clue to solve them
(crash in composer for high resolution exports, shp network performances, 
It makes me think we should'nt underestimate work to have a stable 2.0.

I also agree with Radim saying an API must last +/- 5 years.

-1 for keeping a legacy API call method, because I estimate actual API
really need improvements. If we wait, plugin repositories will have more and
more plugin bases on old API, and migration effort will be even higher.


Then I insist on the fact that users in professionnals environnements need
regular stable releases so that master is not to far from stable branch. (I
don't want to pay for special releases for my own use... this is wasted
money and dev time)

+ 2 with Jean-Roc. Moreover, I can tell that one release a year is enough,
because I don't have time to test and deploy and train users more often ! 
That would be very nice if we could stabilize an annual release planning, so
that every developper or decision maker knows it clearly.

In my GSoC 2010 work I have done exactly that thing: support old API
backed by the new iterators. But it has proved to cause trouble when
combined with locking - imagine this case:
1. a function calls layer.select(). The old API support will
initialize an iterator and acquire a lock.
2. the function reads just one feature, then exits. Lock is still
acquired by old API support, because it is not possible to tell
whether some more features won't be fetched. If the function would
3. user triggers redraw of the canvas
4. renderer tries to acquire the lock... but it's still being held by
old API support, so the rendering thread has to wait... indefinitely

Normally if a function reads all data served from layer.select() that
would be not a problem, because the lock would be freed.

So this lead me to the decision that keeping old vector data fetching
API is not an option.

How does the new API handle this?

Is there only one iterator at the same time allowed which has to be
released to allow another iterator on the same object?

In this case it truly is a problem. I imagined parallel iterators, where
update could just claim another iterator and not care if anything else
is iterating on the same provider. Although it's probably a considerable
higher amount of work to implement this on all data providers.

There is an iterator class that you would use like this:

QgsFeatureIterator it = layer.getFeatures(request)
while (it.nextFeature(f)) { do_something; }

The constructor typically acquires a lock, when the iterator gets out
of scope, its destructor calls close() so the lock is released.

In python you could use just this:

while f in layer.getFeatures(request): do_something

Yes, with the current design only one thread (iterator) can read
particular data at the same time.

This is where I would like to get in future. But as you noted this
approach needs greater amount of updates in providers:
- claiming another iterator means establishment of a new connection to
the resource (file, db/web connection)
- necessity to keep a pool of connections (to avoid the overhead of
establishing new connections) and cleaning of the pool when idle to
save resources
- make sure that modifications happen only when no iterators are active
- ...
But these are really things related just to internals of providers, so
no API changes will be necessary. In any case, this is not crucial for
rendering as usually there aren't concurrent requests for data (from
other parts of QGIS) while rendering - but if they are, they need to
be solved somehow - hence the locking mechanism.

Hi devs,

My humble opinions :

* We should go for api breakage asap, or we will postpone it next time we
will speak again about it.

* +1 for contacting every plugin author and give them a documentation on
how to migrate their plugins to the new api.

* if plugin authors do not respond, we consider their plugin(s) are not
active anymore : if someone has time to replace the author and port the
plugin to the new api, it is great. If not, this must not be a blocker.
Because unmaintained plugins are ... unmaintained. If users really need
theses plugins, they will provide ressources (human, time, money) to help
some other devs to upgrade it.

* ok to have a release every year : it will let devs organize themselves,
and user will have the habit to wait for a new version only at one time of
the year (merry christmas). It will help companies like our to build a
strong commercial offer around Qgis, Qgis Server, and to build up to date
training courses.

* we could release every 6 month like ubuntu, but I am not sure we have the
manpower to do so. If yes, this will be the best IMHO


Hum... reading my text above, it sounds too simple : I do not take into
account the need for bug fixing. One year without a bug fix can be very
long. And backporting means to have time and manpower... ARg, stuck again !

For me it's not a problem if we release every 6 months. The most important 
thing is to release fixpacks (i.e. 1.7.1, 1.7.2, etc). For example, we 
cannot use 1.8.0 because of bugs not present in 1.7.4 and it seems that we 
never see a 1.8.1 bugfix release.

But now there are no backports too. There is a release (currently 1.8.0) and
nightly builds for those who need them or want latest features/bugfixes.
Same with your suggestion: one release per year and nightly builds

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to load DLL plugin map layer?
Message-ID: <11FEFB79BB74EC488B17BFF8961A4E7B71EA9D@mx.edisoft.pt>

Hi!

 

I developed an external DLL map layer plugin and i'm trying to load it
at my application start up....but without success?

My intention it is to provide a layer to my application, similar to the
one developed in python "openlayers".

My application framework uses the Quantum GIS api and i intend to add a
layer using my external DLL as it is done by open layers, adding google
layer to Quantum Gis!

I kindly ask, just a few hints on how to accomplish it!!

 

---------------------------

Another interesting thing that i have in my environment it is that when
i run Quantum Gis in Debug mode in Vusial Studio 10, blow up and do not
start Quantum Gis:

blow up at this line, mpPlot = new QwtPlot( mpHistogramWidget ); //file:
qgsgpsinformationwidget.cpp

when running in release version, it start up Quantum Gis successfull.

 

Thanks for your help

Marco

Hi,

I think this is happening with all the plugins that collect data from raster layers. For example, 

Value tool:

Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "/home/pedro/.qgis//python/plugins/valuetool/valuewidget.py", line 285, in printValue
??? isok,ident = layer.identify(pos)
AttributeError: 'QgsRasterLayer' object has no attribute 'identify'


Profile tool:

Traceback (most recent call last):
? File "/home/pedro/.qgis//python/plugins/profiletool/profileplugin.py", line 189, in doubleClicked
??? self.doprofile.calculateProfil(self.pointstoDraw,self.mdl, self.plotlibrary)
? File "/home/pedro/.qgis//python/plugins/profiletool/tools/doprofile.py", line 79, in calculateProfil
??? self.profiles[i] = DataReaderTool().dataReaderTool(self.iface, self.tool, self.profiles[i], self.pointstoDraw, self.dockwidget.checkBox.isChecked())
? File "/home/pedro/.qgis//python/plugins/profiletool/tools/dataReaderTool.py", line 117, in dataReaderTool
??? ident = layer.identify(QgsPoint(xC,yC))
AttributeError: 'QgsRasterLayer' object has no attribute 'identify'

I notice that the identify type is not required.
Simply changing:

ident = rastLayer.identify(point)[1]

to?

ident = rastLayer.dataProvider().identify(point)[1]

should work...


2012/10/19 G. Allegri <giohappy at gmail.com>

AFAICS the identify method has moved to QgsRasterDataProvider, and has changed the signature (now you pass the type of identify).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QtSQL location has moved PySide
Message-ID: <5089ED40.4050703@wildintellect.com>

On some OS it looks like the location of the python bindings to qtsql
has moved and is causing any plugin that imports to fail.

Specifically on ubuntu 12.04 and newer it's inside pyside. I'm not sure
if this affects other systems (Win/Mac). So it might be advised for
plugin authors to do an if statement or a try/except to catch the right
load.

Old:
from PyQt4.QtSql import *

New:
from PySide.QtSql import *


Quick hack to get them working, on your system if you need the plugins
to work and can't wait for them to be fixed upstream. In you
/home/user/.qgis/python/plugins folder run
find . -name "*.py" -exec sed -i -e "s/PyQt4.QtSql/PySide.QtSql/g" {} \;

Hi all.
I noticed that changing raster resolution for GRASS from the pupup
(GRASS region settings) does not seem to have any effect. Could anyone
confirm? Is it a problem of the QGIS plugin, or it comes from further up
in GRASS?
Thanks.

Hi,

In Japanese Windows environment, GRASS commands output xml text of interface
description that begins with the following line.
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="CP932"?>

CP932 is the system default encoding of Japanese Windows environment.
QDomDocument has ability of detecting encoding, but it doesn't recognize
encoding name "CP932". See http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/QTextCodec.html

Just a quick note to let you know where the problem is.

Minoru Akagi

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to have a better QGIS: let's manage targeted
	donations
Message-ID: <508A24DA.2090809@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
For the smooth and fast release of 2.0 to happen, we need some help from users.
We decided to fix at least:
- new symbology, replacing the old one
- new labelling, replacing the old one
- sextante
- new web site
- manuals completed in the new infrastructure.
Moreover, it is likely that we'll need some work to fix plugins, broken because of API changes.
We agreed in starting to handle targeted donations, with one of the several systems available (e.g. PledgeBank etc.; I've also seen the system recently introduced by Ubuntu [0]; nice but too invasive for my taste).
I do not have experience in any of those, so I would ask all of you to share your knowledge, experience, and preferences.
Also, I would greatly appreciate if someone would step in and help in the management of the system.
In the meantime, I would ask developers to check if they have time do complete one of more of the task, and estimate the necessary resources.
If we can tap on this, I am pretty sure our development cycle will improve, with benefits for all users, so please come and help.
All the best.

Hi Alex

are you sure it has been moved? PyQt4 and PySide are separate
projects, both of them should have their own QtSql module. Isn't that
just missing python-qt4-sql package on your side? Maybe your fix
works, but I would be afraid of some incompatibilities between PyQt4
and PySide that are hard to predict.

Ah I think I was having trouble finding the pyqt version of it. I think
I found it now in the package:
python-qt4-sql

Will double check that one works.

Hi All


Firstly my apologies for taking so long to join in to this thread (and
for top posting) - I haven't been able to come up for air since
leaving Essen. In terms of the release roadmap for 2.0 the following
items were discussed in the hackfest in Essen as being the key
features we would hold the release for:

1) Raster overhaul
2) WMTS Support
3) Atlas integration for composer
4) WCS Client support
5) Transactional WFS support for QGIS Server
6) SIP Bindings revision
7) Symbology overhaul (needs support for random colour assignment and
property change on multiselections)
8) Sextante
9) Threading (non blocker wait fro 3.0)
10) Labelling overhaul
11) Diagrams overhaul (and remove of old implementation)
12) Oracle support (non blocker for 2.0)
13) Web site and docs update
14) Universal usage of expression builder

We agreed that when these features are present we will roll out the
release, with the hope that that could take place early next year.
Come end of December I think we should take a look at the items listed
and if any are obviously not making headway we should remove them from
the blocker list or find out if there is a way to bring them to the
foreground. The list above was also not intended to be exclusive, so
if other developments are offered for incorporation they will be
considered and accepted / declined on their merits.


<release manager hat off>

* My opinion on whether or not to include Martin's work is that we
should include it as I prefer one large disruption (along with raster
and other API breaking changes) rather than that we have a succession
of them. As Martin pointed out we have maintained 1.0 compatibility
for around 4 years and it would be nice to have a stable API again for
the next few years.

* I also think we need to be pragmatic here - we have a window of
opportunity with Martins work that may not come around in the near
future again - if he gets busy with his job etc. we may land up back
in the situation we had with the last threading branch.

* Adding a max version identifier as has been suggested (with max 1.8
being assumed if min version <= 1.8 and max version not explicitly
given) seems like a pragmatic way to deal with marking plugins as
unsupported.

* One of the major limitations I and the many people that contact me
about QGIS experience is lack of performance. Just yesterday I got an
email from someone in Sudan trying to use QGIS to work with ~300 000
point records and it taking 4 hours to do some simple operations on
the dataset.  I know you can deal with large datasets more effectively
in e.g. PostGIS but this is beyond the skill level of many of the
users who naturally gravitate towards QGIS 'because it is easy' - I
think we tantalise people with an increasingly rich feature set and
then frustrate them with slow performance. Putting in threading (and
other performance boosting improvements) will help to improve this.

For these reasons I vote +1 for Martin to merge in his work.

<release manager hat off/>

A few other general thread responses (with my release manager hat back
on again):

- no bugfix releases for 1.8 are planned unless someone wants to
volunteer for the maintenance, release and packaging process we simply
don't have the manpower
- no 1.9 release - we have broken API already and following
http://semver.org/ this precludes us doing another release.
- release cadence - releasing yearly is probably unlikely developers
(and developer funders too) need to see their work rolled out into
public releases regularly. If you want a yearly cadence, simply pick
one release a year and hold off on deploying newer releases in that
year.
- managing expectations  - I think it is very important that we (the
docs and community team especially) really prepare good materials to
accompany the release explaining the implications of the release and
the path to follow to get their preferred tools working on 2.0
- as Code PSC representative, Marco H ultimately should be the one who
facilitates the decision as to whether Martins work can be merged,
>From a release point of view I would support its inclusion assuming
Marco is happy that it is stable and doesn't break QGIS in new and
mysterious ways.

A last 'dreaming of a nicer vector api' note for Martin: Since you are
adjusting the feature iterator API, wouldn't it also be nice to
support this:

for reading:

    while myProvider.nextFeature(myFeature):  # or equivalent in new api
        myGeometry = myFeature.geometry()
        myFooValue = myFeature['foo']
        .... do stuff .....

And for writing:

            myNewFeature = QgsFeature()
            myGeometry = QgsGeometry.fromWkt(myRectangle.asWktPolygon())
            myNewFeature.setGeometry(myGeometry)
            myNewFeature['foo'] = 'bar'
            myResult = myMemoryProvider.addFeatures(myFeatures)
            myMemoryLayer.commitChanges()

In otherwords, the AttributeMap is nice for feature introspection but
its heavy baggage when all you want to do is write or read features.


Regards

Tim

In other words, if somebody needs a bugfix release, they are welcome to
jump in and support the backporting and the release, nobody will stop
them (and probably lots of people will thank, maybe even support).
All the best.

+1 for me too. I only think it is vital for the health of the project
that we make sure we do not release a 2.0 with hundreds of broken
plugins, in case plugin developers do not upgrade them in time. Believe
it or not, many users cannot use QGIS without their preferred plugin.
BTW, could please somebody move the important plugins still missing in
the new repo?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Custom CRS handling
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP431C8BF6A9549CE63C94932BA7D0@phx.gbl>

Hi developers,

I am a heavy user of custom CRS (not by choice !)and the current custom 
CRS definition dialog is not very intuitivein my opinion, so I started 
to work on it to replace it with a new versionallowing to:
* see the list of custom CRS (instead of browsing them one by one)
* copy an existing CRS to a new custom one (custom CRS are mostly based 
on standard ones with some modified parameters)
* use the dialog OK or cancel buttons to save the modifications instead 
of having to saveeach modification
* use functions taken from the QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem class to 
improve validity checks and maybe later allow other syntax than proj4
* I think it would allow me later to remove the warning about different 
CRS I get from some tools when I use the same CRS but with different 
proj4 strings.

However, I realized the QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem::createFromProj4() 
function always checks the CRS database and adds the CRS to it if it is 
not present already, with an automatic name "Generated CRS". This means 
I cannot use it to manipulate any CRS not yet saved in the database.

Do you think it would be a good idea to separate the creation of the CRS 
object and the saving to the database ? Was there any special reason to 
join both?

Regards,

Leyan

I think such cases should be handled by only fetching a sample of the
data for visualization purpose, rather than the full set. And similarly
only a subset of vertices could be fetched when facing dense vectors.

This is something that might need an API change too, as you would need
the providers to be told when the data has to be fetched only for
visualization (thus generalization is possible) or for editing (thus
you want all the data, possibly forcing a restriction on extent).

Just my 2 cents.

Thanks for the clarification. Even though I do not not fully
understand some items, it gives an idea of the plans. Would be good to
have a wiki page with few more details and status of the items: not
started / in progress / done.

Good news, that's on the branch already ;-)

The changes on the branch make adding such improvement possible:
requests are encapsulated into QgsFeatureRequest class, so the
generalization could be implemented with a new flag within that class
- some providers could support it, some would just ignore it (or fetch
all vertices and let GEOS simplify the geometry before rendering).

Hi all,

There's quite a bit of activity on the Sextante plugin, and I'd like to
keep up with the latest developments. It seems things have changed recently
so I have a couple of questions about the best approach:

1) As far as I can tell, active development is now happening on GitHub QGIS
core rather than svn; if I fork the QGIS repo, can I use just the sextante
plugin with old faithful QGIS 1.8.0, or could I run into conflicts?

2) I am encountering quite a few bugs which are relatively easy to fix. If
I do so, should I log them on hub.qgis.org and supply a patch, or is it
better to initiate a pull request on GitHub?

Thanks,
Rudi

Yes, you can use SEXTANTE from core with older QGIS versions.

Better to issue pull request with bug description. But also you can
create ticket
and add link to pull request in it.

I confirm, SEXTANTE do not use any newer stuff from QGIS. I myself
test everything on a stable 1.8

I do not know if I will get a notification if there is a
SEXTANTE-related pull request in the QGIS repo, but I guess that is a
good idea. Opening a ticket in the SEXTANTE bug-tracker with the patch
is also a good idea

Thanks in advance!

AFAIK all devs get notifications about all pull requests and comments to them

Sounds like something worth considering.
Something else I have been thinking of and what would increase
performance pretty good in some situations would be to be able to select
by an expression:

myFeatureSet = provider.select( QgsExpression( 'attr1 = 1 AND attr2 > 5'
) )
while myFeatureSet.nextFeature(myFeature):
  do interesting stuff...

I'm working here on a dataset with several thousand lines and I want
create a rubberband on some of them (Lets say 500).
Possibilities now are:
 * Request each single feature by id (It's based on a pg view which
takes 0.5 seconds to be built, multiplied by 500: 250seconds...)
 * Request all features, iterate and check if it's in the list. This can
also consume a considerable amount of time depending on the total cound
of features.

I guess what I'm talking about could be called Database Abstraction
Layer.

Thank you for clarification.
In this case +1 from me for breaking the API.

Maybe most plugins can even be fixed with sed? And for others grep can
give a hint where you have missed something.

I'm already looking forward to this.

good questions. I think for those on the new repo, the downloads and

one more reason to move the remaining ones (especially several
digitizing plugins).

I have cloned the GitHub repo, and have symbolically linked the
~/.qgis/python/plugins/sextante directory to
Quantum-GIS/python/plugins/sextante.

When I load QGIS, it does give me an error, stemming from
sextante/about/AboutDialog.py; in particular, 'from ui_aboutdialogbase
import Ui_DlgAbout' produces an ImportError (No module named
ui_aboutdialogbase).

I imagine this should be provided by PyQt

I imagine this should be provided by PyQt4.QtGui? Am I using an outdated

Okay, I see I'll have to figure out CMake... Is there an easy way to build
just the sextante plugin, or do I have to build the whole QGIS system?

You do not actually have to build SEXTANTE, just a couple of GUI files
(the about dialog and a resources file). I guess Alex can give you
better advise in this, since he introduced that changed. Until that, I
was doing the GUI files directly without using the pyQt tools (not the
optimal way, I guess...), so no build was needed, but now you need it
to get the .py files from the resource files.

You have to use pyrcc4 and pyuic4 to compile those files. I guess you
can do it manually if you do not want to build using CMake

As Victor said, you only need to compile resource file and some dialogs
(currently only About dialog). Just run commands

pyrcc4 -o /path/to/sextante/resources_rc.py /path/to/sextante/resources.qrc
pyuic4 -o /path/to/sextante/about/ui_aboutdialogbase.py
/path/to/sextante/about/aboutdialogbase.ui

You can create custom makefile that will do this for you.

But note that I plan to move all SEXTANTE dialogs to .ui files because
this simlifies maintenance and makes code cleaner. So maybe it is
better to build full QGIS. Now python plugins correctly loaded from
build dir. So you can symlink SEXTANTE from output directory to your
main QGIS plugin dir.

Thanks, that did the trick. I can see that building the full QGIS would
make sense though, so I'll get my build environment set up to do that. For
now it's good to know how to just compile sextante though.

Thanks,
Rudi

Thanks I will be moving the checklists from the wiki into the

Wohooo! Does that work for C++ api too?

Yes I think there are heaps of similar optimisations we could make (we
had some nice discussions about other possible optimisations in
Essen). Does anyone know what became of the GSOC project to generalise
features on the fly? It would be great to see that merged if the
results of the work are usable.

Yes, this is another feature I have in my mind, something that could
be later added to QgsFeatureRequest. Actually for expressions there
are two choices: expressions for QgsExpression and provider's native
expressions (e.g. SQL supported by PostGIS). The difference is that
the former ones should work for any provider, while the latter ones
only for those with some native expression language - those are likely
to be faster since the expression would be executed in the backend, so
less data transfer and thus faster fetching.

For now the support for attribute fetching by field name is like this:
value = feature.attribute("foo");
But I guess there's no problem to implement operator[], too:
value = feature["foo"];

() is fine - I more meant does the concept work in C++. Great improvement!

By the way, what is the URI for your branch / repo - is it in a usable

Tim, my branch is available here [1], but I haven't updated it
recently because I have been modifying QgsFeature attributes from a
map to a vector, and that is not yet complete. Still you can find
QgsFeatureRequest, QgsFeatureIterator classes already there.

Hi Martin

Could you write an e-mail to the developer list once you have updated 
the branch? It will be good to let people play a few days with the 
branch before merging changes to trunk.

Do you have a roadmap/timeline when you plan to merge the two steps? 
Tim: is the feature freeze end of December?

I'm looking forward to the new code!

Regards,
Marco

The former one (native expressions) should be pretty straightforward to
implement and will surely be useful for some very specific tasks and
allows to use the full potential of the backend.

The later one could be inspired by OpenDBX [1] or similar (I have no
personal experience with this. It would be nice if somebody who has
could give advice). I would very much like this approach as it would
allow developers to support all database backends without additional
effort. For the end user there would be a reduced risk for a lock-in
[2].
I think this could be implemented in the data-provider as an abstract
method, which filters all the data locally. Each data provider can then
implement a set of basic expressions supported by the backend to be
evaluated there (and maybe fallback in case of new expressions not yet
implemented in a specific dataprovider)

Message-ID: <508D6EEA.5000302@carto.net>

Hi,

At the HF in Essen I promised to create a mindmap representing the quite
distributed infrastructure. Here it is:

http://app.wisemapping.com/c/maps/81444/public

Before we officially publish it I would like others to add and correct.
Please let me know your email if you plan to contribute - this is a
web-based mindmapping tool where you can edit the mindmap in your
webbrowser.

I tried to add URLs and comments with a short explanation and the
responsible administrators.

Best greetings,
Andreas

 Hi Paolo,

 You can mouse over the little icons to the left of the text to see the 
 comments and the links.

 If you want to edit I need to register you as an editor (in the sharing 
 settings).

Andreas,

That is looking really good.  Nice to see where things are in relation
to everything else.  Might be good to have the different build servers
and some notes about who maintains them and their specs.

The Linux builds are done in the www.(plugins/plant/hub).qgis.org VM (It's a 
single VM!). The Windows nightly builds are done on a internal machine of jef, 
AFAIK.

I would conctentrate on the technical dependencies of the QGIS infrastructure 
and therefore remove the Commercial support componies, etc.

 Hi Pirmin,

 I removed the commercial support and QGIS associations and added the 
 build servers.

 I added Paolo and you in the sharing settings so you can correct and 
 edit the mind map. You should have received a separate email with the 
 link.

Very nice! Oh you can add the android build server is on linfiniti's server

Is the mind map downloadable in a re-usable form? Might be nice to get
it as a graphviz file or similar.

I think we had enough time to think about the date, so let's proceed. I added
the date to the website and you could change to wiki page, please, so we

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geometry operation (python) crashes QGIS
Message-ID: <508E67E1.4080003@venus.uni-freiburg.de>

Der QGIS developers,

I'm trying to write a python plugin to reate input data for one of our 
models. It basicly converts three shape files with special fields to a 
text file.

I have a buildings vector (polygon) layer containing three polygons 
(which I created for testing). This layer is called "build" in the code. 
To extract its geometries, I wrote a little function:

def extract_poly_geometry(self, layer):
feature = QgsFeature()
geom_list = []
while layer.dataProvider().nextFeature(feature):
geom_list.append(feature.geometry())
return geom_list

In the main part of my program it is called by "theINPolyShapeField = 
self.extract_poly_geometry(build)". "len(theINPolyShapeField)" returnes 3.

Later I iterate over the polygons and try to run some code for each of them:

for a in range(0, (len(theINPolyShapeField) - 1), 1): # going through 
buildings (polygons)
thepoly = theINPolyShapeField[a] # extract building number a
QMessageBox.information(None, "DEBUG:", str(thepoly))
# polyarea = float(thepoly.area()) --> carashes QGIS (segmentation fault)
QMessageBox.information(None, "DEBUG:", str(thepoly.asPolygon()))

I use the QMessageBoxes for debuging. The first one returns 
"qgis.core.QgsGeometry object at 0xbbe889c", which I assume is correct. 
The second one however deliveres an empty list, "[]".

I then tried to convert the geometry to MultyPoint by 
"str(thepoly.asMultiPoint()" and was trying to display the result using 
"QMessageBox.information(None, "DEBUG:", str(thepoly.asMultiPoint()))" 
to have a look at the points, but this also crashes QGIS with 
segmentation fault?

I checked the type of thepoly on the console by 
"print(thepoly.wkbType())" which returns "3". According to Quantum GIS 
API Documentation this means "WKBPolygon". So thepoly is a polygon, is it?

I tried thepoly.validateGeometry() on the python console to track down 
the error. When I tried it for my first geometry, it returned "[]". A 
call for the second one crashed QGIS with segmentation fault?

I'm afraid I'm stuck?

Regards,
Dominik

The problem in your code is that you are storing QgsGeometry instances
which are owned by the QgsFeature instance. So when another feature is
stored into your QgsFeature instance (in nextFeature() call) or when
feature instance goes out of scope, the geometry instance becomes
invalid - you still have a python object, but it contains a dangling
pointer, hence the crashes. The solution is to store a copy of the
geometry:
geom_list.append( QgsGeometry( feature.geometry() ) )

Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Points from polygon's geometry vertices
Message-ID: <508E999C.6040507@venus.uni-freiburg.de>

Hi again!

Maybe you could also help me with an other issue: I need to save the 
coordinates of the polygon vertices to a list for later processing. I 
tried with "thepoints = thepoly.asMultiPoint()" but get an empty list.
In the API Documentation I found that the function asMultPoint() needs a 
MultiPoint-geometry as input (what makes no sense to me, as I don't need 
to convert it if it is already MultiPoint??).

Is there an other function that does what I want, or am I calling the 
asMultiPoint function wrong?

Regards and sorry for disturbing again!

Dominik

Dominik,
if you have a polygon, then you need to use asPolygon() method. It
will give you list of rings (and each ring is a list of vertices). The
list of rings always has at least one ring (the outer one) - if there
are more rings then your polygon has some holes. The function
asMultiPoint() works only for geometry type MultiPoint (which is
something completely different, see [1]).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatial Operator in QgsExpression
Message-ID: <508EBC5A.9040204@gmail.com>

Hi all,

As Marco has said for the review of POST WFS GetFeature Request in 
QGIS-Server #6535, it would be interesting to use QGS Expression for 
OGC:Filter instead of an old code wrote just for the QGIS-Server.

I've started writing Spatial Operator in QgsExpression, You can see the 
code here :
https://github.com/rldhont/Quantum-GIS/tree/6535

I would like to know how you imagine the dump and the text version of 
OGC Spatial Operator (BBOX, Intercets, Crosses, Contains, Disjoint, 
Within, etc).
I've started with text like this :
* SpatialOperator('The geometry as WKT')
What do you think about this ?

It would be better for the invert ramps to be inside the "Generate new
color map" box, and invert the order of the color ramp, instead of
inverting the rgb colours.

Like the 1-band raster colour table plugin did (it does not work with master).

Unless someone disagrees I'll look into implementing that.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Cloudflare for qgis.org sites
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8mz+ZmYNibFAfHA06_+bdnqSJb4SugYn_aoZL=GTeWCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The recent downtime of qgis.org sites reminds me of several corporate
websites I've worked with that, due to design requirements, needed to
remain with older server software and code base. The older sites could
not handle the bot traffic, and needed extra up-front security and a
cdn system to remain viable as their traffic grew.

I've been involved with Cloudflare.com shortly after its inception
[0], and I can definitely recommend using its services as a web-based
reverse proxy in front of sites that can use the advantages it offers:
off-site caching, threat blocking with API (great for blocking DoS
attacks), auto-insertion of Google Analytics, worldwide content
distribution netowrk, site offline notices, inexpensive SSL etc. All
of this without any changes to the sites, and only small changes to
DNS records and server configs.

The free plan with them will do a lot to start, though the Pro plan
offers the SSL and other nice features [1]. They are also pretty good
to work with, and may be able to extend a price break for the project,
in return for sponsor status and recognition.

Basically, using Cloudflare reduced the server load on my recent VPS
instance by ~30%, before tweaking cache headers, etc. (cloudfare ->
nginx rev proxy -> apache/php )

Regards (and no, I'm not affiliated with them),

Larry

Does:

ldd /usr/lib/qgis/plugins/libogrprovider.so

show any library issues when run from the same environment as where
your standalone script runs?

Hi,

It sounds very very interesting but unfortunately they run closed
source proprietary software, even if is SAAS I would stay away from
that.

Does anything similar exists in the FOSS world?

BTW, yesterday I saw from "top" peaks of 6 to 12 load average,
probably caused by a combination of C++ code compilation, dpkg
packaging, a couple of bots indexing content and ruby/python web apps
running, probably too much for a VPS, but the website has been running
without major downtimes during the past 2 years.

Let's see if we can do some further caching/optimization and if the
renice of packaging has any effect. If the problem persists we must
obviously find a solution.

You could checkout the earliest versions from the git repo but I think
you would have trouble building it.

Yes, this would be indeed a good thing to use QgsExpression to
evaluate OGC filter expressions, thanks for working on that!

I would have few comments regarding your code:
- I don't think that creation of "spatial operator" class is the right
way to go. Spatial operators can be handled as ordinary functions -
there is already generic support for functions, so let's use that.
Also, the functions should be able to handle arbitrary geometry, not
necessarily just the one stored in the feature... the geometry stored
in the feature could be just another special column, e.g. "$geom"
- The geometry is just another type of value, so it is preferable to
store it within QVariant, so it can be passed around as a normal
value. You will need to enable its use in QVariant with
Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(QgsGeometry*)
- geometries need a way to construct them - currently you build them
explicitly from GML... I would suggest creating functions like
GeomFromWKT and GeomFromGML that would take a string parameter and
return a QgsGeometry* inside a QVariant. One could also consider
adding simple geometry accessor functions like GeomToWKT.

So, to answer your original question, the syntax would be e.g.:
Intersects($geom, GeomFromWKT('POINT(10 20)'))

In future I would like to have support not only for spatial operators,
but also general spatial processing (intersection, buffer etc) - that
should be rather easy to add once we have some support for geometries.

Regards
Martin

Message-ID: <F76DC1C7-41D8-4BF3-8178-60DB0EC91835@archtech.gr>

Hi all,

Im using qmake to build a C++ plug.

On mac I get a .dylib and I can't load it in the same way as in other OSs.

Im not sure, but I think has something to do this the dylib, as the cmake official build is producing .so files for the plugs.

Even though I search I can't make qmake produce a .so lib on mac.

Any ideas? help?

Best,
Tasos

it might help to run any non-critical processes with nice and ionice like this:

You need to use a MODULE type for the cmake ADD_LIBRARY().  I don't know how to do this with qmake, but the linker flag is -bundle instead of -dylib.

Hi,

So something like that should work:

macx:QMAKE_LFLAGS_PLUGIN -= -dynamiclib
macx:QMAKE_LFLAGS_PLUGIN += -bundle

But it didn't.
I still get a dylib file and if I rename it to .so QGIS will crash (as it really a dylid and qgis is confused) or not load at all (if I leave it as dylib and move it to the plugin folder).

Thanks
Tasos

If you are doing both of those at the same time, I'm guessing that dynamiclib (probably synonym for dylib) is overriding bundle.

You can figure out what it really linked as with:

  file /path/to/your/plugin

But then, the difference between a dylib and a bundle is not a big one - a dylib can be loaded like a bundle.  Maybe there is a different problem?

Im not doing both together:
one in "-=" and the bundle is "+="

This is what I get
g++-4.2 -headerpad_max_install_names -FXXX/lib -arch x86_64 -single_module -bundle -Xarch_x86_64 -mmacosx-version-min=10.6 -o libTest.dylib debug/XX.o ?.

file libTest.dylib              
libTest.dylib: Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library x86_64


Im not sure if Im don't something else wrong. On linux everything work perfect.

Where should I put a dylib file in order to load it as a QGIS plugin on a Mac OSX?

Best

That's very odd.  The -bundle option should create a bundle but you're getting a dynamic library.  The only thing I can think of (and equally very odd) is that the linker sees the .dylib extension on the output file and thinks you really meant a dynamiclib.

Anyways, as I said, a dynamiclib (that's what they are on linux, linux doesn't have the shared lib/module distinction) should still be loadable as a plugin.  As long as it has a .so extension (it will not load a .dylib as a plugin), and it's in the plugins folder with the rest of the plugins, QGIS will load it.  if it is causing a crash, then something else is probably wrong (and it's beyond my skills).

The crash log might help figure out what's wrong.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Flow Trace plugin too slow
Message-ID: <1351623547038-5012357.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello All,

I have written my first Qgis plugin and I am currently testing and improving
it.  The plugin is called "Flow Trace" and it selects all lines upstream of
a selected line feature.  The lines are selected by extracting upstream and
downstream coordinate values and getting a distance between the values.  If
the value is less than a tolerance than the feature is added to a selection
list and is then repeated for each feature in the selection list.  I will be
using this plugin to make sure all lines (sanitary sewers) are flowing in
the right direction.   It can also check a line shapefile is connected to
each other line as expected.  The plugin works for what I need but it is
very slow.  How can I make it faster?  Below is the basic outline of the
plugin.

Get selected feature upstream coordinate
Iterate thru ALL features, comparing upstream coordinate to downstream
coordinate.
Repeat for each feature found if distance is less than tolerance

I attached the file because it was too long to embed into the email
flowtrace.py

Alessandro,I don't understand what you mean 'unfortunately' here. If
their service is non-FOSS, what bearing does this have on the project?
I don't see how it would create any licensing issues, either.

The service they provide is a global internet utility, like the
proprietary software on much of Cisco's hardware, or storage solutions
like Amazon S3. While I fully understand the desire to be 100% FOSS,
I'm not sure users of the sites will care, if the sites stay up; or,
that a FOSS alternative can even approach what Cloudflare (or another
commercial solution) has built.

What's wrong with paying for (or possibly getting for free) a
proprietary product if it provides a solid solution on top of existing
infrastructure?

Quoting Alessandro:
a redirect from planet.qgis.org to  plugins.qgis.org/planet whould
probably do.

Maybe better to rename the main app to web.qgis.org  (or something
like that) and then have a couple of redirections or transparent
rewrites:
plugins.qgis.org ->  web.qgis.org/plugins
planet.qgis.org -> web.qgis.org/planet

Hi all.
Just tested a connection on Asus Nexus tablet, and it asks to overwrite

anyone confirms? Is this a genuine bug?

Probably the package was not downloaded fully or correctly.
Please try again, and make it sure it is complete.

Technologically speaking: nothing.

Politically speaking: something.

Mine was just a personal opinion: some of us dedicate a lot of energy
and efforts to promote FOSS solutions, I know there are many different
point of views about this topic, I just wouldn't use a service
advertised as "Our proprietary technology .... "
(http://www.cloudflare.com/features-cdn) in the context of an OSS
project.

Message-ID: <CAMFSZzoqvDpGj63K780VNx66rZZ2LF0du6dVhbAZW5X-u5+muA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I would like to know how to change the renderer type in a PyQGis
application.
The vector layer (Spatialite) is a singleSymbol type currently. (Point
geometries) and I need to change the symbols depending on the value of an
attribute in the layer.
I am new to Python and QGis so have no idea how to do this. (I notice that
there is no setType method on the QgsFeatureRendererV2, which i would have
assumed would do the trick)

Any help appreciated
