 "QPen::setWidthF: Setting a pen width that is out of range"
Message-ID: <004401da25d5$155c8e60$4015ab20$@gmail.com>

Hello,
I have a PyQGIS app, that generates a PDFs from an Atlas.
If I generate the PDF directly from QGIS Desktop all PDF generate correctly.
But If I generate the PDF with my PyQGIS app, some PDF don't generate
properly (some elements do not appear) and give error "QPen::setWidthF:
Setting a pen width that is out of range".
The first PDF contains all the elements, the other PDF are parts of first
PDF, so the elements are missing in some PDFs that are in the first.
One year ago, this app works perfect.
I have tried to change all PDF export options, but the error continues.
I make this question in Gis StackExchange, and no one give any answer:

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Report for Qt-for-python evaluation
Message-ID: <87v89ehqnv.fsf@julienlaptop.home>


Hi PSC, devs,

I wanted to report for the work being done regarding Qt-for-python evaluation.

This work was funded by QGIS.org using a special budget first allocated to Denis Rouzaud, who transferred it to me regarding the work that I had done on it recently.

Main goal was to set up a functionning CI and trigger python tests on QGIS core to better ascertain the feasability of providing a python binding using Qt-for-python instead of PyQt.

I managed to this and tried to fix as many issues as possible using the allocated remaining time.

You can find more details on the QEP [0]

If we decide to continue in that direction, I imagine the following steps could be to fix even more tests and issues on qgis core before eventually trying to wrap other modules (gui, analysis).

Regards,
Julien

Hello,

Thanks again for the technical work and improving the workflow.

+1 for the lazy consensus on non breaking changes.

Regarding the license topic:

+1 for the metadata field with a spdx license. But take care, it's not so easy to a have an exhaustive list. Maybe we should move to the PyPi classifiers since plugins are Python packages and there is already a work on maintaining a metadata ecosystem, including tooling to check it (pip install packaging).

Are we okay with the step back to only a non-blocking warning?

Regards

Hello everyone,

Thank you all. It's truly an honor to work on this project.
I will begin by utilizing QEP to create a QEP that summarizes this discussion and going forward with the suggestion to make the license file recommended for now.

I have reviewed the tickets in the backlog and will evaluate their size. If I come across anything that I don't understand, I will add comments to seek clarification.

Best regards,
Lova

Hi Tim,

For the workflow, that sounds great, thanks a lot!
I agree only breaking changes should go "the long way" and for simple fixes and improvements we should just get them done with low overhead.
Going forward with a small QEP for the license sounds very good.
Regarding the metadata, I would suggest we use the ids from https://spdx.org/licenses/.
So for the usual QGIS plugin case, that would be

    license=GPL-2.0-or-later

On another note, I just added a couple of tickets to the backlog, I am not able to estimate the size of them, so if they are too complicated, just don't prioritize them.

Thank you and best regards
Matthias

Tim/Lova, thanks for your outstanding efforts and commitment here!

It's really exciting to see all the love and attention that the web and plugin infrastructure is getting as a result! ?


Thanks so much Nyall and all credit goes to Lova who is doing fantastic work! What I suggest is that moving forward, Lova uses QEP's too propose and discuss breaking / major workflow changes on the plugins site. In that QEP he can address:

* what the change is (link back to ticket in QGIS-Django for example)
* what the impact will be
* proposed roll out time line
etc.

And we can discuss and agree these changes there before he goes ahead with it. For smaller changes, I suggest he 'just get on with it' - his scrum board is public and you are all welcome to help prioritise his work.

For the current issue under discussion (license requirements for plugins), I have asked Lova to make a QEP and synthesize the discussion there, mainly so he can have a practice run at going through the QEP process, although I will add my 2c that I like Matthias' simple solution to the problem (adding license as a line to the metadata.txt). If I understand you right Matthias, our metadata would then look like this?:

-----------------------------
[general]
name=QGIS Animation Workbench
description=A plugin to let you build animations in QGIS
about=QGIS Animation Bench exists because we wanted to use all the awesome cartography features in QGIS and make cool, animated maps! QGIS already includes the Temporal Manager which allows you to produce animations for time-based data. But what if you want to make animations where you travel around the map, zooming in and out, and perhaps making features on the map wiggle and jiggle as the animation progresses? That is what the animation workbench tries to solve...
version=1.1
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
author=Tim Sutton
email=tim at kartoza.com<mailto:tim at kartoza.com>
repository=https://github.com/timlinux/QGISAnimationPlugin
license=GPLv2
-----------------------------

There is probably another thread to this discussion which is to understand which license are accepted and which not, but that is a job for another QEP I guess...!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Regular paid positions for PR reviews
Message-ID: <CAL5Q673tpxVN-7DCUo_rxMH2EWUfaHS--hdLRiMsS+WjfcGKRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Recently I have had the opportunity to discuss with some core QGIS
developers and we agreed that it would be a good idea if the QGIS
organization could fund a few weekly or monthly hours for PR reviews.

Here is my quick and initial proposal of requisites for the candidates:

- must be an active well known and long time QGIS C++ core developer
(for example from the top last 5 years committers [1])
- ideally we'd need more than a single developer: there is not a
single developer who is able to review all different areas of the code
base
- available for regular work (fixed number of weekly or monthly hours,
to be determined)

Note: the above list is just my quick ideas, feel free to suggest
anything you think best.

 I would like this topic to be added to the next PSC meeting agenda.

Kind regards.

Dear Alex,

I support this idea. Code reviews are important.

But I think we already do that - don't we? In 2023 there was this 14k ?
budget that is currently being distributed between the core devs who are
actively reviewing on Github. Next year, we plan to increase this budget to
20k.

Are we missing anything?

I am not sure if it is useful to dedicate an "exact" number of hours and a
fixed rate. I'd rather have a fixed annual budget (like we already have)
and distribute this among the core devs who actively participate in the
reviews and discussions.

We can formalize this a bit better if you want. I am open for suggestions
how to improve the situation.

Another idea is to merge the budgets for bug fixing and code reviewing -
then the "approved" core devs can spend their hours on both bug fixing and
reviewing and invoice everything together.

It is a really good timing to discuss this now - because we want to bring
the 2024 budget to vote next week.

Greetings,
Andreas

I think the idea was to go from voluntary random PR review
contributions to a regular commitment we can count upon.

That's exactly the point, some of us think it would be better the other way.

No, I would say we keep it separate, I agree that during the
bug-fixing time the participants can spend their time doing both
bugfixing and PR reviews provided that the reviews are oriented to bug
fixing/chores and not to new features.

I look forward to other developers' opinions.

Kind regards.

Hi All,

Thanks Alessandro for raising this.

First of all, thanks a lot to all PR reviewers for their outstanding work.

As an occasional QGIS contributor (for a long time), I've definitely
noticed a lack of PR reviewers lately. It'd be great if the QGIS
association could pay more core devs to participate in the review process.

Hopefully, that will reduce the number of PRs that go to 'Stale' status,
which might be a bit discouraging sometimes.
This is a topic we discussed with other QGIS contributors in the latest *QGIS
contributor meeting* in Vienna, and they had the same feeling.


Regards,

Germ?n

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] GRASS on Windows issue
Message-ID: <CADsUavG0Q-pC12CVnN_7_y8YvFj6_mn59kO5nhvjeOd6s5KD8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys.


I know this a QGIS list, but maybe Windows packagers for the OSGeo4W stack
lurk around here.

I have sent this to GRASS dev list after sending to OSGeo4W list a week ago
to no avail.

I hope anyone can help me.

On a clean install of OSGeo4W (and for that matter standalone QGIS and
GRASS installers), I get the following error (see attached screenshot)
starting any version of GRASS.

On GRASS 7, I can do a mapset selection before crash, but the other 2 just
crashes.

Install is on a machine that ran GRASS up until a week ago, until I
uninstalled the OSGeo4W stack, and deleted everything.  There is nothing
strange about my Windows Setup

I hope anyone can help me, and I hope you can see the screenshot.

Regards

Pieter

Are you saying grass 8.3.1-3 (as of Dec 2nd) still has that issue?

Hi,

If possible, can we place all 3 models in a ?group? or ?project?? Each model depends on the other one but currently, they must be upload one at a time.  That could be a good improvement to the server.

Good luck!

It is a pleasure for me to work on the project.
I?ve created a QEP<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/279> that summarizes this discussion. As suggested, I think we can go forward with the non-blocking warning for now and implement licensing requirements on schedule. I'll be creating a documented PR for this fix shortly.

Hello,

Thanks again for the technical work and improving the workflow.

+1 for the lazy consensus on non breaking changes.

Regarding the license topic:

+1 for the metadata field with a spdx license. But take care, it's not so easy to a have an exhaustive list. Maybe we should move to the PyPi classifiers since plugins are Python packages and there is already a work on maintaining a metadata ecosystem, including tooling to check it (pip install packaging).

Are we okay with the step back to only a non-blocking warning?

Regards

Hello everyone,

Thank you all. It's truly an honor to work on this project.
I will begin by utilizing QEP to create a QEP that summarizes this discussion and going forward with the suggestion to make the license file recommended for now.

I have reviewed the tickets in the backlog and will evaluate their size. If I come across anything that I don't understand, I will add comments to seek clarification.

Best regards,

Hi Tim,

For the workflow, that sounds great, thanks a lot!
I agree only breaking changes should go "the long way" and for simple fixes and improvements we should just get them done with low overhead.
Going forward with a small QEP for the license sounds very good.
Regarding the metadata, I would suggest we use the ids from https://spdx.org/licenses/.
So for the usual QGIS plugin case, that would be

    license=GPL-2.0-or-later

On another note, I just added a couple of tickets to the backlog, I am not able to estimate the size of them, so if they are too complicated, just don't prioritize them.

Thank you and best regards
Matthias

I also asked Lova to try to work through all the old issues and fix / close them as appropriate so we can try to get the number of tickets down to a small number.

Tim/Lova, thanks for your outstanding efforts and commitment here!

It's really exciting to see all the love and attention that the web and plugin infrastructure is getting as a result! ?


Thanks so much Nyall and all credit goes to Lova who is doing fantastic work! What I suggest is that moving forward, Lova uses QEP's too propose and discuss breaking / major workflow changes on the plugins site. In that QEP he can address:

* what the change is (link back to ticket in QGIS-Django for example)
* what the impact will be
* proposed roll out time line
etc.

And we can discuss and agree these changes there before he goes ahead with it. For smaller changes, I suggest he 'just get on with it' - his scrum board is public and you are all welcome to help prioritise his work.

For the current issue under discussion (license requirements for plugins), I have asked Lova to make a QEP and synthesize the discussion there, mainly so he can have a practice run at going through the QEP process, although I will add my 2c that I like Matthias' simple solution to the problem (adding license as a line to the metadata.txt). If I understand you right Matthias, our metadata would then look like this?:

-----------------------------
[general]
name=QGIS Animation Workbench
description=A plugin to let you build animations in QGIS
about=QGIS Animation Bench exists because we wanted to use all the awesome cartography features in QGIS and make cool, animated maps! QGIS already includes the Temporal Manager which allows you to produce animations for time-based data. But what if you want to make animations where you travel around the map, zooming in and out, and perhaps making features on the map wiggle and jiggle as the animation progresses? That is what the animation workbench tries to solve...
version=1.1
qgisMinimumVersion=3.0
author=Tim Sutton
email=tim at kartoza.com<mailto:tim at kartoza.com>
repository=https://github.com/timlinux/QGISAnimationPlugin
license=GPLv2
-----------------------------

There is probably another thread to this discussion which is to understand which license are accepted and which not, but that is a job for another QEP I guess...!

Regards

Tim

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] C++17 explicit --std required?
Message-ID: <rmifs08yafv.fsf@s1.lexort.com>

(I picked -developer rather than -user because this is in the weeds of
build issues.  Please feel free to tell me I chose wrongly if so.)

I maintain the qgis entry in pkgsrc, which is currently at 3.28.13.
(For now, we are packaging LTR.)

As part of debugging problems related to sip 6.8.0 (see
  https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/55481
), I am trying to clean up the compiler situation.

pkgsrc distinguishes between

  requiring that the compiler used supports c++17

  modifying the compiler wrappers to insert --std=c++17, because
  requiring that a compiler supports c++17 is not the same as requiring
  that c++17 is default, and sometimes code sssumes it is.

My view has generally been that one cannot assume the default std of a
compiler and that if a program requires a particular level it must test
for and pass --std=c++NN (or gnu++NN if that's how it is).

I am currently building qgis with a requirement that c++17 be available
(which is satisfied because the base system compiler is gcc10) but not
set to force --std.   I see a warning:

/tmp/work/geography/qgis/work/qgis-3.28.13/src/core/settings/qgssettingsregistrycore.h:178:18: warning: inline variables are only available with '-std=c++17' or '-std=gnu++17'
  178 |     static const inline QgsSettingsEntryBool settingsEnableWMSTilePrefetching = QgsSettingsEntryBool( QStringLiteral( "enable_wms_tile_prefetch" ), QgsSettings::Prefix::WMS, false, QStringLiteral( "Whether to include WMS layers when rendering tiles adjacent to the visible map area" ) );
      |                  ^~~~~~

which suggests that the build is using C++17 features without having
inserted --std=c++17.   Reading
  https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx-status.html
it looks like C++17 became default in gcc 11, and C++14 is the default
in gcc 6.1 through 10.

Looking at INSTALL.md, I don't see a requirement for C++17 stated at
all.

Looking at CMakeLists.txt, I see some kind of c++17 forcing for MSVC,
but I don't see anything for other cases.  I see some kind of forcing in
individual CMakeLists.

So:

  Is it an error of me to build without wrappers that force --std=c++17?

  Is this just a qgis bug, that files that require C++17 aren't
  cmake-coded to pass --std=c++17?

  Is this harmless and should be ignored?

  something else?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS - QT6 Build Status Report
Message-ID: <CAL5Q672_P5PS2-12qJQX5oGTshpwzuZjFBo1f3tjMqkE7obQbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

as you probably know during the developers meeting in s-Hertogenbosch
it was decided to allocate a budget for developers that wanted to
dedicate some time to remove the blockers that prevented QGIS to be
eventually migrated to QT6.

I volunteered to coordinate the effort and organized a few meetings to
track the advancement of the efforts.

The good news is that thanks to the efforts and the brilliant work of
the participants we now have made significant steps towards the goal.

Here are the last QT6 meeting minutes:

Kind regards.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Plugin text and box squeeze in different
 windows/mac screen
Message-ID: <CALG-VURhB0y-8tPg6mFZM5QLdxoc1diOMLt=A9qmLYqV3Hoifg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Is there a routine to keep the same the resolution when the plugin is open
in different laptop/pc screen?
what I noticed is that my plugin gets squeezed in different screen other
than the one it was used to be built in.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CALuHMPBGfGf6paz3=DxFCzxEEQHD8c7WPDZ9v0tpowXnjKvQrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

Since QGIS 3.24 we have the QgsDockableWidgetHelper class [0] which is
used to switch from dock widget and top-level window representation.
However this class is not available in Python.

Are there any reasons not to expose it to Python bindings?

Hello,

I have a PyQGIS app, that generates a PDFs from an Atlas.

If I generate the PDF directly from QGIS Desktop all PDF generate correctly.

But If I generate the PDF with my PyQGIS app, some PDF don't generate
properly (some elements do not appear) and give error "QPen::setWidthF:
Setting a pen width that is out of range".

The first PDF contains all the elements, the other PDF are parts of first
PDF, so the elements are missing in some PDFs that are in the first.

One year ago, this app works perfect.

I have tried to change all PDF export options, but the error continues.

I make this question in Gis StackExchange, and no one give any answer:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/469644/pyqgis-qgslayoutexporter-gives-error-qpensetwidthf-setting-a-pen-width-that

Here is a part of my code:

# Generate atlas

# Es una QgsLayoutAtlas

myAtlas.beginRender()

myAtlas.next()

for i in range(0, myAtlas.count()):



    exporter = QgsLayoutExporter(myAtlas.layout())

file_name=os.path.join(dir_destiny,'Individuals')+'/'+myAtlas.currentFilename()+".pdf"



    pdf_settings=QgsLayoutExporter.PdfExportSettings()

    pdf_settings.forceVectorOutput=False

    pdf_settings.exportMetadata = False

    pdf_settings.appendGeoreference = False



    #pdf_settings.textRenderFormat =
QgsRenderContext.TextFormatAlwaysOutlines  # For "Always Export Text
as Paths"

    pdf_settings.textRenderFormat =
QgsRenderContext.TextFormatAlwaysText # For "Always Export Text as
Text Objects"



    pdf_settings.rasterizeWholeImage = True # For "Disable tiled
raster layer exports" Hace que ocupe menos si es TRUE

    pdf_settings.simplifyGeometries = False



    exporter.exportToPdf(file_name,pdf_settings)



Thank you In advance for your attention and help.



Kind regards,

http://test.qgis.org/

is still in use, see also
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Server-CertifSuite/issues/24

Also the demo QGIS Server http://qgis4.qgis.org: is not available (402 
Bad Gateway):

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Latest Plugin Version Timestamp
Message-ID: <CABPxTTppzpWSU=fwDd==6=EoMMJtYDD=LUpLqMpEr4Zdxjw3CA@mail.gmail.com>

I noticed that you changed the plugin version timestamp on the QGIS plugin
repository web pages and in part I like it, but do you really need to use
decimal seconds (i.e.  2023-11-02T16:44:07.716972+00:00). This just takes
up excessive space on the web page and I believe you can replace '+00:000'
with 'Z'. That would shorten it more so it would look like
2023-11-02T16:44:07Z.
That would be preferable to me.

Thanks,
Calvin

Hi Calvin,
indeed the display of the plugins version has been recently modified.
Anyway the current displayed version format is not the intended one.
Please see 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/315#issuecomment-1869307984 and 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/315#issuecomment-1869422268

It seems to me a cloudflare caching issue.

Best regards.

Andrea

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Running unit tests without "make install"
Message-ID: <CAKKm1vHTgTNfW4=iPoC9bOenHA3mEC4ssAzNgzSnSUMrhWoBSQ@mail.gmail.com>

The docs (
https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/developers_guide/unittesting.html#run-your-tests)
specify: *make && make install && make test*.

I would rather not run make install, since I have another instance of QGIS
installed via APT, and I worry running make install will somehow make a
mess and leave me without a working instance.

But is it really necessary to run make install before make run? In fact it
seems more natural to me to test before installing!

Sincerely

Hi Thomas, generally the easiest way to solve this sort of problem is to
use a virtual machine to isolate the install from the rest of your
computer. You'll find instructions for doing this with docker in the qgis
repository here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/.docker

Happy new year!

Try running "ctest" from your build directory. There's no need to install
if doing it this way. (It's how I do all of my development)
