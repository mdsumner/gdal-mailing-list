Hi,

I am trying to report a bug, but http://hub.qgis.org/ does not work.

I get:

--------------------

Application error

Rails application failed to start properly

--------------------

Already last week at the hackfest I had troubles with hub.qgis.org -
sometimes it worked, sometimes it fails. Can we do something so that
this becomes more reliable?

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

This really applies to non-local data sources. Network latency can be
huge issue, it can also be problematic if a bbox strategy isn't in use.
You are right this is not Postgis specific. Database servers are more
likely to be remote (shapefiles on a network share are a terrible idea
in almost all cases). Maybe the recommendation is that people pipe
Postgis through a WFS service when they want to use it this way? If I
think about it that way WMS or WMTS would actually be a good way to get
speed - but you can't really see attribute tables that way. Wonder if
there's some way to hybridize it. Of course this assumes said users have
the ability to setup such services in house quickly for new layers.

I've experienced this with DB tables from 1-100+ GB, it's not as big an
issue with non DB (Oracle, MSSQL, etc) formats because they don't get as
large. The problem is that most people forget to zoom in before turning
on the layer, or if they need to see the whole extent the whole data is
transferred before the renderer can simplify it. It's almost like a set
of postgis views used similar to pyramids in rasters with simplification
algorithms applied before transmission would be a way to handle it. Not
QGIS specific but I could see a plugin in QGIS to build the views in
Postgis.

Panning/Zooming requests data if the data isn't already cached. So if
you start panning then go back to a spot you've been before you already
have it.

I agree that always on caching is bad, hence my suggestion for a user
toggle per layer. When doing cartography work you just need to be able
work a little faster with the rendering for it to not be frustrating.
Same for digitizing (assuming the postgis layer in question is reference).

Thanks,
Alex

I restarted apache on the "old" qgis server and hub seems to work again ..
though all CPU were at 100% ..
Seems that the redmine problem grows at the same speed the database grows :)

At one point we should really think about either updating redmine or
migrate to an external service.

kind regards
Werner

It's a combination of disk filling and a ruby memory leak/stuck process.

Concerning the disk, cleanup began last week of various things including
moving the plugins site. Not sure why it filled up again so fast.

Concerning the ruby issue. There is a cron job that is supposed to be
killing out of control processes but it doesn't seem to work anymore.
I don't know who wrote it:
/usr/local/sbin/weigh-passengers
But we can probably make it more aggressive, or someone can make sure
it's actually running like its supposed to. The cron job does not appear
to be running every 5 minutes like used to.

Richard is working on longer term balancing.

Thanks,
Alex

hmmm

I've seen we've 41 security updates on that server pending
and 11 package updates including apache2

among security updates there are mysql and postgis..

I don't know if it safe to just upgrade them (as I don't know if one
of the installed software requires a specific version)
But probably updating could help?
I am not sure

Or maybe... it's Ruby?

We too have a web server  that uses Ruby (not Redmine, but another product
to publish news, etc) and it's not too uncommon to have 100% CPU usage.

Hi Alex,

thanks for your response. I comment in between.

Well, I am assuming a defined and maintained spatial index on any 
spatial table.
AFAIK a lot of latency results from connecting to the db before doing 
any SELECT. I do not know if and for how long QGIS keeps connections 
open (I remember that UNM mapserver offered a configuration to keep the 
connection open). But, as I said before, my remote (though in the same 
LAN) PostgreSQL server is really fast.

total agree, but that's what my users do in order to share and have 
these files backed up. Maybe we should not cache these to teach 'em :-)

Ok, this is an extreme case. But on the other hand: If you have a huge 
dataset and try to look at all its features, creating the cache will 
consume some time, too, so it might be even slower at the beginning, 
while gaining speed afterwards, once the cache is in place.

It might also be useful to have scale based rules. Or split the data up 
into several relations (either tables or views) thus gaining speed by 
threaded rendering?

ok, so the cache is getting bigger and bigger as you move around the map?

another thought: how about only requesting fields necessary for 
labelling/styling, even as a setting in the fields tab ("do not load 
from source"). Not sure if that is useful as I assume that normally 
geometries are responsible for most of the data transfer.

Hi,

I think caching is really a missing feature.
I like the idea if the user can turn it on/off and clear it easily
(keyboard shortcut like in a browser ?). For advanced users, maybe allow
to set the cache size.

I'm not aware of postgis that we are using for something (other then
maybe some buildprocess some time ago). Anybody else knows this?

Security updated we should off course have done.

Anybody very familiar with backing up mysql db's (as if I'm correct,
that one is used for redmine??). Please correct me if I'm wrong in this!

Well, I'm not a big fan of caching for database datasource, and have never
been experiencing latency with postgis. 
For shp latencies (not reproduced with tab format), VSI_CACHE is a GDAL
cache variable, set in startup script (qgis.bat on windows). Not sure if
that is exactly the caching you want, but this helps solving the network
latencies. 
Cheers
R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ranking GSoC proposals
Message-ID: <CALuHMPDHkDaj2N2sJoK+p8St4HdYdmaYAuo-xBihRR1X9rydVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

yet another reminder about GSoC. We have 4 proposals:
 - QGis Plugin: Report generator out of spatial data
 - Schematization Plug-in for QGIS
 - LiDAR support for QGis
 - Unified "Add Data" dialog for QGis

All proposals still without mentors and ranking. We need to decide
ASAP and submit rankings to OSGeo admins by Friday, 4th April
to be able to get slots


Thanks

Personally I don't think this one is a job for student.  Not that they are
not talented, just that it needs a lot of work and a bit of UX thought.
This is something we need to flesh out more I think then just jumping in
with something.

Hi,

http://planet.qgis.org/ shows only a notification that "the server 
software is running" while the real planet sits on 
http://plugins.qgis.org/planet/

I think the best would be to move it to the planet subdomain and 
implement a redirect on the page where it is currently accessible, but 
if that's not possible for whatever reason at least we should redirect 
the planet subdomain to the site where the planet is reachable now.

If I remember correct Tim and Anita were redirecting domains at the

Probably they forgot about planet.qgis.org ?

Agreed. Moreover, it seems that this year we have very weak proposals.
Most of them miss important information, there are many problems with
students reaction on emails and proposal comments.

I send private mails to all student encouraging them to start discussions
in dev-list to get more feedback from community without any success.

planet.qgis.org is apparently already pointing to qgis2, but I have to
add a redirect...

Hi all.
Maybe the problems are not new, but:
* changing the resolution by editing the grass region does not work (all
subsequent analyses are at the resolution of the origin raster)
* loading a vector after an analysis works well, whereas adding it from
the browser results in the loading of all individual topology layers.
Does anybody confirms?
All the best, and thanks.

There were plans to add such functionality for ages, but nothing ever
got into the codebase... Issue #3200 has an old patch attached, mainly
for an inspiration.

I would love to have this functionality in QGIS - not only for
PostGIS, but more generic framework for caching of vector features. I
believe this will bring another boost to the rendering performance,
not only for remote connections, but also for local data sources that
are non-trivial to parse or that do not support spatial index or
attribute index natively.

It would be great to have a common framework in QGIS that would do:
1. feature storage
2. spatial indexing  (R-tree)
3. attribute indexing (B-tree)
4. full-text indexing
All that based on pages, with maximum allowed memory usage, with
ability to swap pages to disk etc. SQLite looks like a good backend
for such thing.

Martin

I may be wrong, but it seems that some kind of caching is done in
other gis packages. I recently tested how rendering time of very large
vectors (a 4 million features shapefile) compared in multi-threaded
qgis and arcgis (by the way, rendering time is very similar) and found
that in AG 1) canvas is not refreshed when doing a selection 2) in AG
loading the same shapefile in a new project (without closing the
program window) is just an instant.

I can't confirm.

In the first case I have no issues here (after having imported the
raster with r.in.gdal). I'm using master/ubuntu.

In the second case the browser (both in qgis and standalone
application) shows a (grass) icon for the location and mapset, then
for vectors it show the classic database/cylinder icon. Opening it  I
see the 0,1,2 layers than can be added just individually.

The qgis browser standalone application crashes when trying to preview
the table of a grass vector layer.

cheers!

There was a big thread a few weeks ago. I think the discussion ended at

It used to behave properly.

does it show also topolayers?

Moreover, creating a location from qgis extent fails.
GRASS 6.4.3-3 and QGIS 2.2 on Debian sid, and standalone on Windows.

Hi,
As for schematization plugin proposal Luciene Delazari and I will be mentors
for this project. There are few more people that can help in this project.
We were also in contact with Anne Ghisle from OSGeo.

AFAIK Luciene proposed this in QGIS wiki and one student is interested in
working on it.
We are in contact with him and we send him our suggestion to his draft
before he send it to GSoC proposal list. But of course, it also should be
discussed in mailing list. I think Luciene could wrote more about this
proposal, as I will be helping mainly in integrating algorithms into QGIS
plugin.

Regards
Piotr

Hi,

I don't know what the "Report generator" plugin includes? It does not
seem to be listed at
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Google_Summer_of_Code_2014 - I just
wanted to let you know that Nyall Dawson works on improving serial
print/reporting functionality. He will include this in the core, not as
a plugin. Just to avoid overlaps.

Hi

First of all thanks everyone who contributed to this thread - there
were many interesting ideas that we can discuss further.

We are still looking for funds for the project (so far we have reached
~70% of the goal) - and therefore contributions are welcome!

This is not part of the refactoring work, but it is very interesting
use case and therefore I will keep it in mind and do the design in a
manner that adding such functionality should be possible. Advanced
legend manipulation could be another followup project.


> - Can some give us some conclusions of what what said in codesprint legend

While we have discussed various aspects, we have not reached too many
conclusions :-)

- legend vs layer manager - there was a good point that we are mixing
the concept of map legend and layer manager into one tree. While these
are related, they get into conflicts... while layer manager should be
a tool for management of the map (and be as powerful as possible), map
legend should provide mainly the help for the user to identify the map
elements (and be as simple as possible).

- support for multiple canvases - while it is not the intent to have
this functionality when the refactoring is complete, the work should
bring us a bit closer to that. It is still unclear how multiple
canvases should behave as there are lots of use cases with different
needs, e.g.:
  - tabbed vs split screen canvases
  - same or different map extent
  - same or different layer styles
  - same or different set of layers / visibility

- new functionality suggested - we discussed some of the ideas from
the thread, especially the ones from Olivier. No conclusion was
reached whether to adopt all of them in the future, but the icons as
indicators for labeling, diagrams, snapping, actions, editing(?) etc
were seen as potentially very useful. They could be even used for
reporting map canvas refresh progress (animated wait icon) or
errors/warnings (e.g. reprojection failed).

I am sure there were more things discussed which I have forgotten
already, other participants please feel free to add your impressions.

Hi Martin, does that mean that we need to wait that your refactoring is
finished before starting a work on proportionnal legends? What is the target
version for that?
This is a high priority use case here, should we fund a temporary plugin for
current versions ? This is sub-optimal too me, and that requires also we
fund first a plugin, and secondly a core feature.

Are you heading to an arcmap like solution with different tabs in layer
registry?

after having experienced Mapinfo, Arcmap, and QGIS dockable Mirror map, I
think Multi Canvas is really required for multi map composers, and current
arcmap design is rather good. We still need Dockable mirror map for on
screen visulisation purposes.

I suggest you to wait... every ad-hoc solution would be refactored again
after release of the new Legend architecture.
Actual design is really limited... the new one will use all the potential
of Qt legend items customization.
One of the Martin's work will be moving legend to gui library allowing
programmatically (e.g using plugins) add new item visualization modes
In this moment of the process, as stated by Martin, we're collecting all
the "default" visualization features that legend should have.

I don't know if you know that exist Dockable Mirror Map plugin that add
this functionality to Qgis... new legend interface will be designed to
allow different rendering/styling for each available canvas.

The refactoring is a requirement for such thing - the goal of that
work is really to allow greater flexibility of legend widget. The plan
is to get it into 2.4 release.

Unfortunately I do not think it would be possible to have a plugin
that would show the proportional legend directly in legend widget or
composer legend. Maybe a plugin that would just generate an image with
proportional legend so it could be included in composition - not a
great solution.

I can imagine a python plugin for QGIS >=2.4 that would add this functionality.

I'm not really sure what you mean... maybe a screenshot would help.

[RH] OK, that is sufficient for me, but I will ask other state services we are trying to coordinate if an higher urgency is there.

[RH] Yes, as Gino says, generating an image is a bad solution. We might be just consolidating LegendSVG plugin if urgency is there.

[RH] 
Don't you have a licence ;-) ? See here [0] what esri calls as dataframe. This is a meta layer group. Only one is activated in mapcanvas. But when user switch to composer view (in the same window, just a small button in status toolbar), then each map object of the composer is a different dataframe. This is much nicer than having to play with "lock layers" checkbox and mapcanvas status. I see users here tends to have one layer group for each map object in multimap composers.. so we're not so far from a user point of view. We just need that new meta layer group.. Of course, that's much more complicated in API.

[RH] Concerning the basic requirements for proportional legends, that's what we have in mind:

- minimal support of proportional symbol sizes in layer registry for point symbols and lines, we just need here 3 symbols with a size + values of these symbols . see [2]
- functional size symbol only  for simple symbols composed of 1 marker: 
	- graduated , categorized and ruled base renderer using no data defined setting. 
	- data defined point size or line width and current advanced proportion field (to be merged with data defined settings see [1]). This use case is more tricky, since we have to read actual data to generate some legend, and we need some user input to choose min and max size and values for legend symbols. See Mapinfo gui [3]. Middle symbol can be generated using active expression, user shouldn't have to take care of this.  
- support for  cleaner legends in composer. We can imagine different layouts and have more classes in legend. See [4]

The updates currently work as follows: until the first map update (250
ms by default) the canvas displays transformed image for previous
rendering process. After 250 ms this is replaced by real map preview
and being updated every 250 ms until rendering is complete. So, if
your "background" layer is not rendered fast enough, you will get the
undesired effect you mention.

If you turn on parallel rendering (menu Options > Rendering > Render
layers in parallel using all available CPU cores), the effect may be
possibly reduced.

I do not know about a ticket, I know Paolo has mentioned that problem
previously (either on the dev list or at the hackfest in Vienna).

I would like address that in the future - probably not for 2.4
release, but maybe for 2.6.

This may well be related to projections (I use 3003 in my trial).

This makes the plugin pretty useless for vectors, I guess.

Hi,
Sorry for the late response, but I am out of the office today and tomorrow.
The idea of the plugin is to develop some functions for schematization.
Suchith and Mark Ware have a previous research and they established some
constraints that we can use as a starting point. Also the work of Piotr is
important since he developed a line simplification algorithm.
We (Piort and I) were in contact with the student during the application
process and he seems very interest.
regards
Luciene

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Identified features vs. Selected features : could
	we merge those ?
Message-ID: <CAExk7p3J-9Ji2ZMbFjoUAvcO9iZbWzpvc1hbUgEaeB-gMQyLNg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

The discussions about this issue http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9907 raised the
question (at least for me) of merging the concepts of Identified features
and Selected features.

I don't know if it's the good moment to discuss this, but since we have a
few other threads talking about a bit more deep user interaction changes, I
thought it could be good to think of this also (even if it's not urgent)...

In short, the idea would be to have both identified features and selected
features be exactly the same thing.
The only difference between the select tool and the identify tool would
then be that the identify tool opens a form window (either the single
feature form or the attribute table in form mode).
The identify tool could then also work in "single","rectangle","polygon"
etc modes.


Rationale FOR:

1. There is already a feature overlap

When identifying one feature only, the "identify tool" can open the form
(provided "open feature form if a single feature is identified" is
checked). But when identifying several features, the way to go is a
selection, which dynamically refreshes the attribute table, and where the
features can be edited in the form mode.
This is also a problem in the scenario of issue #9907 : to open the form of
overlapping features, you have to use a selection, if you don't want to
spend too many clicks expanding the "identify window" tree, finding the
right feature, and clicking on it's "open feature form" button. This also
has the annoying consequence of being unpredicable : the effect of the tool
will sometimes be opening the form (when one feature gets identified), and
sometimes to open that "identifying results" window (when several features
got identified).

*2. The attribute table in form mode is actually great*

The "identify results" window is not very practical: the folded tree
requires expanding, it does not provide a good overview of what is
selected, does not take editing widgets into account etc.
Meanwhile, the form view is great (both the single feature form and the
multiple features form in the attribute table). It's clear, neat, even
allows to choose which field to use to list the selection, etc... It's sad
that it's a bit hidden in the UI, I find it one of the best additions to
the UI that has been made lately.

*3. Both functions are very similar in how they work and look*

Both require you to click on a feature, and have a visual feedback
consisting of highlighting the feature. It's very confusing for beginners
as it's uncommon for softwares to implement two different types of
selections.

*4. Having the attribute table in form mode for editing is promising for
the future*

Because we could implement edition on several feature at once (currently,
one needs a plugin to set an attribute on different features at once, and
those plugin do not yet take the field widgets into account).



Rationale AGAINST (and of course counterarguments) :

*1. Identification is not the same than selection*
Users sometimes want to work on a selection, while still being able to
identify features.
To allow this usage, either we could offer workaround features by
implementing store/restore selections and/or have selections in the undo
stack (grouped), or we could make an exception for the "identify single
feature", which would not set the selection, but only open the feature form
(current behavior).

*2. Identification would stop working across several layers (top-down mode)*
Since it is difficult to imagine having the attribute table window display
selections from several layers. Technically, it would be doable in the form
view, since it does show only one form at a time, but it may be more clear
simply to remove this possibility.
However, we could keep the current behaviour when using "identify single
feature" though. This tool's behviour could keep the same functions that
currently, adding the feature #9907 and an "open attribute table in form
mode even if only one feature is selected" option. (to be clarified)

I guess I missed some uses of the "identify results" window ?


What do you think ?


Best regards,

Olivier

Message-ID: <201404030027.02496.even.rouault@mines-paris.org>

Hi,

This is something I discussed with Paolo during the past Code Sprint. In the 
original EPSG databases, there is an area of applicability defined as a 
bounding box in latitude,longitude for each spatial reference system. In the 
import process of the EPSG database used for libgeotiff, GDAL, proj.4 and 
PostGIS ( detailed in 
http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/geotiff/trunk/libgeotiff/csv/README ), that area of 
applicability is not currently imported in the .csv files concerning geographic 
or projected SRS (but they are imported for datum shift transforms).

A potential improvement would be to add it and expose it in the GDAL 
OGRSpatialReference object, so that QGIS could benefit from it.
This could be used for example :
- to warn the user when reprojection to a SRS is completely or partially out 
of its area of applicability
- to filter the SRS catalog to offer only the relevant SRS at a point or on a 
zone
- ...

Hi Olivier,

I always thought it was a good idea, and you did a nice overview.
That would be a big +1 for, me, mainly because there is a big redundancy 
between these two features.

Also, I think that the identify modes should be cleaned up.
The new "layer slection" mode is very useful and does solve the problem 
of opening the right layer attributes table. I have seen many old-time 
users not aware of its existence, but when they discover it they use 
this one only.
I wonder if we should not keep this one only.

Thanks for bringing this up!

Denis

That could a new tool with a better designed window to display the result.
I think that you know if you'll ask for raster or vector before using 
identify.

Moreover, identify a raster is kind of meaning less.  I think that 
something like "Evaluate" would be more appropriate, although I'm far 
from being a native English speaker ;)

Hi,

I am skeptical - mainly for the reasons you list in your rationale
against it. Selection and identification are really two different tasks.
You do not want to loose your selection just because you want to query
the attributes of the feature.

Identification works with all layers, while selection should only work
on the selected layer to get predictable results. Users should be making
selections intentionally rather than by accident because the selection
works on all layers and they are not aware of what they are doing.

The identify tool has been improved several times - we added the
top-down-stop-at-first mode (which most of my users like) and then later
on the new "layer choice mode" with an interactive choice in a drop-down
menu. So we have 4 modes now, with the two described above as the more
powerful ones. I still think there is a use-case for all of the four
modes, but maybe the most recent addition (the "layer choice mode")
should be the default.

Selection is essential in GIS - useful for exporting features, run
analysis only on selected features, field calculator updates, plugins,
processing, etc. The identify mode should not change the selection.

The selection tool was improved over time as well, with shortcuts, free
form selection, circular mode, etc., etc.

I am open to improving the identification tool (e.g. by opening the form
in the mode where one can toggle between table and form easily instead
of just the form) - but please let's keep the selection and
identification tools separated.

Message-ID: <2C5F82DA3EE3E449BD473075F2C290BF98FE5511@NINSRV05.nina.no>

Hi,

I am trying to build QGIS from source on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS because I have a custom GDAL and GRASS installation, and I want to build QGIS against those.

I downloaded the code yesterday evening from https://github.com/qgis/QGIS.git (branch release-2_2).
It configures fine using ccmake, but on "make" I get the following error message (at ca. 20%):
src/providers/ogr/qgsogrgeometrysimplifier.cpp:255:69: error: ?OGR_G_SetPoints? was not declared in this scope

Any hints? Thanks for helping.

Cheers
Stefan

Hi,
Sorry for the late response, but I am out of the office today and tomorrow.
The idea of the plugin is to develop some functions for schematization.
Suchith and Mark Ware have a previous research and they established some constraints that we can use as a starting point. Also the work of Piotr is important since he developed a line simplification algorithm.
We (Piort and I) were in contact with the student during the application process and he seems very interest.

Another one is that we should really now take care of not changing ergonomy
of main tools on each version...because many users took time to learn a
professionnal tool, and have difficulties with self learning. IMHO, strong
ergonomy changes should be grouped and tested alltogether in depth. I start
to have users not liking a lot that tools change so often their behaviour
(not me) , like digitizing end click.. Please  

I agree identify window needs some improvements, but I think this is a
mandatory feature
. 
Some tweaks I had in mind (tickets existing for a while):

 - ability to change the options (first layer, current layer...) and open
feature form accessible from identify window

- abitlity to have fields in table order, or alphabetic order

- semi-transparency (adjustable)

- tooltips on fields that show fields comments and field true name if alias
is set.

Cheers

Related to this dicussion: regarding the form of how the elements are painted on the map, I would like to discuss an idea.?

To avoid repainting the full content of the map when the selection changes (it can very heavy for big contents), I find it interesting to modify how the highlight of the elements is done by painting similar to how it does the identification tool (it uses QgsHighlight class). Basically, disconnec the rendered map to the selected elements to draw.

Alvaro

Thanks a lot, works beautifully.
A few of suggestions:
* please move it to Vector menu
* consider porting it to Processing, it would be very useful there
* add a description, and/or change name to make it easier for people to
find it.
Again, many thanks.

Hi !

Thanks for your reactions !
Below is an updated suggestion, which tries to keep the spirit of separated
identified features and selected features concepts, while still providing
some usage improvements.


One thing I'm not at ease with is the point about "not changing the
ergonomics".
I mean, if we find out a better/more simple way to do something, we have to
do it. The fact that users are used to an old unpractical way is no good
reason for not doing it. Because if it was, we'd be stuck in improving QGIS.
It's a matter of minutes to get used to this type of changes, and if a user
really doesn't accept change at all, he's still free to stick to his
current version.
I find it better to think of new users when thinking about the UI, because
it helps going for the most simple and logical implementations. Plus, I
guess in the case of QGIS, it's more of a challenge to attract new users
than to keep the old ones.
That doesn't justify change for the sake change, but we are talking about
improvements (even if small), not just changes.


*Identify features window*

*R?gis:*

>
> *I agree identify window needs some improvements, but I think this is a
> mandatory feature*


Can you develop on this ?
The only feature I see is that it displays those "derived" information
(currently area&perimeter) which can't be found easily otherwise. But:
- Is it the best way to show them ? When having "show form if only one
feature is identified", you can't show them on one feature anymore.
- It's still several (hard) clicks to display that information.
- Wouldn't map tooltips be better ? Maybe we could have those info display
by default as tootips on vector layers ?
- What if I'm interested in other "derived" information (centroid...) or if
I want to customize those (number formatting...) ?

The other features (discriminating one layer from multiple identify
results) is done much better by that "select layer" mode.
In case of overlapping features (in a same layer), we could have the same
dropdown menu (or submenu, in case we have overlapping features in the same
layer + overlapping layers) to choose which feature you want to identify.
Exactly the same implementation would be perfect for the "action" tool.

This would actually be enough to replace the "identify results" window. The
real time visual feedback on what's going to be identified is great, and a
contextual (sub-)menu is much more friendly than a tree.
Having each time only one feature identified, it would always open the
feature's form, and never open the "identify results" window. I'd be very
happy with that !!


*Identify multiple features*

I still find the idea of being able to open the attribute table in form
mode for several features great.
Maybe for this, we could have subtools (under the identify tool) called
"Identify by selection", "Identify by rectangle selection", "Identify by
polygon selection", ... which would work as said, i.e. exactly like the
selection tool except that they open the attribute table in form mode.
This would make it clear that it's actually going to define a selection,
and make the attribute table in form mode much more accessible.

So we get the best of the two worlds : ability to identify a feature even
if there's currently a selection, and also being able to take advantage of
the great current implementation of the attribute form mode and the
flexibility of the selection tools.

I believe this will be awesome at the point we implement modifying
attributes of several features at once.

+1, this would also deal with the problem with complex styles (for instance
an offseted transparent polygon for the shadow, where the shadow is also
highlighted)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Dropping vertices at intersections
Message-ID: <533D4137.6080803@geograph.co.za>

Hi All,
I've looked at the topology plugin, but can't find what I need to do.
I've been exporting the data into Genamap and doing this with scripts, 
but it would be nice to do it in QGIS.
Anyone know of a plugin?

Quite often now we've been asked to deliver products whereby there are 
vertices placed onto graphic elements where they cross over, or end on, 
each other (in different layers (Shape files)).

eg: A road line stops at the edge of a cropfield polygon, so drop a 
vertice at that place, on the cropfield boundary. Likewise if a road 
runs through a field, but the data capture scale requires the field not 
to be split into two polygons, drop the vertice at the points where the 
road crosses over the field boundary.

Ideally this could be implemented by:

  * Check boxes to select all the layers you want to process (mixture
    between multiple polygon and line layers)
  * selecting the snapping distance (for lines that end "close enough"
    to other boundaries or lines).
  * Having a separate checkbox for "Crossover" and for "Line ends"
  * Perhaps even an option to log (create a pointfile) when lines end
    within 'X' of any boundary or line (where X is a secondary snap
    distance)
  * perhaps have an option to log (point file) where lines run parallel
    to others, within the snap distance set (maybe with even a tertiary
    snap distance)

Instead of looping through multiple snap distances, one could implement 
a checkbox to either drop the vertice, or to just mark the position 
where the vertice should have been dropped - this would be easier for 
the developer, but require the user to run the procedure multiple times, 
in order to see where "close enough" stuff lies.

Any comments?

Regards,
Zoltan

In addition to Piotr and Luciene , myself , Mark Ware from the schematization research community will provide additional guidance to the student based on our previous research in this.

There is no FOSS tool for schematization and the aim is to develop a plugin for QGIS. The bigger aim is also to make it a platform for research collaboration for the schematization community, so other students in future an make use of this tool and build upon it for thier research.

You can get an idea of the wider schematization research  http://www.dagstuhl.de/de/programm/kalender/semhp/?semnr=10461 

Please give your comments/suggestions so the student can improve the proposal. Thanks.

Suchith

Hi,
Sorry for the late response, but I am out of the office today and tomorrow.
The idea of the plugin is to develop some functions for schematization.
Suchith and Mark Ware have a previous research and they established some constraints that we can use as a starting point. Also the work of Piotr is important since he developed a line simplification algorithm.
We (Piort and I) were in contact with the student during the application process and he seems very interest.
regards
Luciene

Message-ID: <533D488E.7080306@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I confirm people are very often into trouble when it comes to enter the
path to specific backends for Processing (e.g. OTB, LASTools, etc.). Any
suggestion on how to make it easier? If a fully automatic system cannot
be devised, maybe an explanation would help? Something like: "Locate
your whathever.exe file -> Add the path of its parent directory to ...
[ex. C:\etc\etc].
BYT, it seems that a user has to enter a path *including* the filename,
even when a folder is necessary: pretty confusing IMHO.
Thanks.

One thing we can implement is a check, so if the user enters a worng
path or the filepath instead of the folder, a small dialog with a
short explanation can pop up.

Adding a small help button close to the path text box can also be a solution

Hi all.
I always assumed that Linear transformation implied a rototranslation

applied: is this intentional? If so, perhaps the user should be warned

Creating a SL DB from New layer works well. When doing the same from the

* the file created does not have a .sqlite (or similar) extension, so it
is difficult to find
* the newly created DB is not registered among the available DBs.
Opinions?

Hi!

I get the following error massage from time to time when using the ValueTool plugin. It seems like it happens when I add or remove a layer:

An error has occured while executing Python code:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:/Users/my_user/.qgis2/python/plugins\valuetool\valuewidget.py", line 500, in invalidatePlot
    if self.mplLine is not None:
AttributeError: 'ValueWidget' object has no attribute 'mplLine'

Python version:
2.7.5 (default, May 15 2013, 22:44:16) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]

QGIS version:
2.2.0-Valmiera Valmiera, c3a2817

What is this about and has it been reported?

Regards, Casper

Hi Saber,
it seems faster now, and it has the big advantage of bein usable for
vectors and rasters as well. Other solutions seem more complex.

Hi Paolo,

Linear transformation creates only a world file and doesn't transform the
raster if the user manual can be trusted.
What you described sounds like a Helmert transformation which uses
coordinate offset, rotation and scale as parameters.

However, the world file has a rotation parameter, that's why I expected
it to be properly written.

	fields ?
Message-ID: <CAFF9ZhtSiPW=MFs5EbB6_KE=NvjC+2Wvv-kCBYHssxdcAPLOiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,


( Sorry for my english, but I try to explain my need as better as I know ).


I need to create  textual notes on many polygons, with QGis, and I would
like to automate more than possible the process.

For the moment, I created an "Action", defined as following:


Note_ACTION

echo [%'\n\nPolygon  (mq) :\n' ||'Area: ' || toint( round ( $area)) || '\n'
|| 'Perimeter: ' || toint( round ($perimeter)) %]


In this way,  clicking on each polygon I have the text I need.   :)

But,  for the moment, it is necessary to copy the text and paste it inside
the  Textual Note.


It could be possible to... create the action in a way that creates directly
the  Textual Note with the text inside ?


Could somebody give me suggestions about this ?

Thank you in advance

Roberto

This has been reported a few times: on the bug tracker and on the qgis-user
mailing list just yesterday. Version 0.8.4, released a week ago, fixes this
bug.

I was able to install that version with qgis-2.2.0 but on linux  - do you
not see the latest version (0.8.4) in the plugin manager?

Hi Oliver,

I agree with Regis we can't be making this kind of changes very often based
on this many "users took time to learn a professionnal tool, and have
difficulties with self learning", this is specially true when you look at
tutorials online which haven't been updated for 2.0 or 2.2 and can make the
life of novice users hell.

I think improvements are always welcome, but maybe big changes like this
should be worked and maybe even create a pull request for it but not merge
it until a 3.0 release maybe? Just a thought

On the identify vrs Selected, I think most or all current used GIS software
have this functionality, right now I think a lot of users from certain
vendor are looking for QGIS to switch and the first thing you do when you
get a new software is to look for the tools you are used to.

Regards

I think both options are useful, sometimes people select a projection they
think is ok but it isn't, showing a warning would be nice.

Could this apply when you add a layer with a projection that is outside
bounds? Show a warning about that also

Thanks. The beauty of the Point Sampling plugin is that it works both
for vectors and for rasters, in one shot.
I still see it reasonable to add it to Processing.
All the best.

OK, I have tried following trivial replacement of pyspatialite with
pysqlite2 and it works great. Can we implement it?

Hi Roberto,

I'm assuming Textual Note is an Attribute Value.

Do you need the value to happen as you draw the polygon? 
	If you do, I don't know and you'll need to wait for someone else.

If you want to write the $perimeter and $area into the attribute table after making your polygons, than I'd use the field calculator. The icon looks like a really small abacus. You can see it on the main icons, but also in the attribute table. You can use this to update all (or just the selected polygons) to show the right information.

This is a better explanation than I could do:
http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/field_calculator.html 
(not just in English, e.g. :
http://www.qgis.org/it/docs/user_manual/working_with_vector/field_calculator.html )

If I've got it all wrong, please do try and make me understand.

-ramon.

I don't see any obvious way to get it working.

Hi Etienne.

Thanks for your reply.

I checked the "Manage and install plugins" but I found no updates. However, I just used a running copy of QGIS and when starting a new instance, the ValueTool update became available.

I guess I expected the plugin manager to check for updates when entering the manager. Anyway I hope the update works :)

This has been reported a few times: on the bug tracker and on the qgis-user mailing list just yesterday. Version 0.8.4, released a week ago, fixes this bug.

I was able to install that version with qgis-2.2.0 but on linux  - do you not see the latest version (0.8.4) in the plugin manager?

should retrieve legend if WMS server has getLegendGraphic capability and
layer has getCapability url specified... so you HAVE to select a
styling. Otherwise, silently do nothing as before when getLegendGraphic
integration wasn't available.

just tested on your server and it works

I forgot to say that if a legendGraphic is available is shown under the
layer in LegendLayer... it's really little and you have to click on it to
open in real dimension (this is due to QgsLegendInterface architectural
limitation)

Legend will be integrated in composer at it's original (dowloaded) dimension

graphic resolution of the legend could be set in options-Canvas &
Legend->WMS getLegendGraphic resolution to match your printing requirements

Hi Ramon and others,

No.  I intended  the "Text Note" function of QGis, that is the rectangular
baloon with text inside :

http://qgis.org/it/docs/user_manual/introduction/general_tools.html#annotation-tools

I need to fill the text automatically, using the "action".

Do you know how to do it ?


Thank you

Hello All,


I have problems with the  "OSM_Editor_RemoteControl"  plugin of QGis.

It  answers :  "Could not connect to the OSM editor.  Did you start it ?"

But... I started  Josm, as you can see here :

Where I wrong ?


Thank you for any info about it

Hi Everybody,

I can't use QString class inside QGis Python Console or inside QGis Python
plugins.
If I use inside a stand alone pyw application, I have no problem (please
note that I run pyw from Eclipse).

Here you are what I do and get inside QGis Python Console:


Python 2.7.5 (default, May 15 2013, 22:44:16) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)] on
WIN-J13S01PK4M5
## Type help(iface) for more info and list of methods.
from PyQt4.QtCore import *
action = QString()

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'QString' is not defined


Are there anybody that can suggest me something?...

Best regards

Francesco

Hi Francesco,

I might be not using the right terms, but since the new SIP API (version 
2), you're not supposed to use Qt types but the standard python types.
So you're suppose to use str() instead of QString.

You my find more details here
https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/17/Python_plugin_API_changes_from_18_to_20

Cheers,

Denis

To be precise, use 'unicode' type instead of QString, the 'str' type
is equivalent of QByteArray. Using 'str' for text leads to problems
with non-ascii characters.

(In Python3, the 'unicode' type has become 'str' and 'str' type has
become 'bytes' - but QGIS still uses Python2)

Hi, 
after checking with other colleagues, waiting that your refactoring is
finished is ok for us. 

We will focuse on user specifications during your refactoring so that we can
launch a contract soon after.

Hi all
Are there any progress about submitting rankings to GSoC? AFAIK only
schematization plugin have mentors and for other propositions there is no
reply from students.
Can we submit ranking for this proposition or there are any obstacles
against it?

	GetCapabilities response
Message-ID: <CAN8Jn0C3z+D_vs5GCBkBw0__V187fsxpp_ARxrMMqYf7k=EhWA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I wonder if value layer Name is correct in QGIS Mapserver GetCapabilities
response. Currently both Name and Title are the same - it is a layer name
as visible in QGIS.

Shouldn't it be more correct if the Name value will contain layer internal
ID (for example roads20131111135915389) and Title will contain user visible
value (for example Roads). It could also help solving problem when user
will set the same name for multiple layers.

Could we provide a patch ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] proposing MetaSearch for QGIS Core
Message-ID: <CAFWXLWUC=6NNkpAgtTMU+3-UPi4x620L0oTePAurKg6Svf3MJw@mail.gmail.com>

tl; dr: we are proposing MetaSearch for inclusion into QGIS core, to
help the discovery (download/add, find/bind) workflow in QGIS. There
are Python dependencies and build workflows that need to be
discussed/resolved, but overall we believe it's a good time to start
this discussion.




Devs: as per https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/wiki/QGIS-Core-Integration,
I'd like to discuss the possibility of integrating the MetaSearch
Catalogue Client into QGIS as a core plugin.

To quote Tim (Sutton):

`tomkralidis: btw it would be great to see the CSW client made ready
to go into QGIS core one of these days - its a missing piece from our
'out of the box OGC compliance'`

Plugin: http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MetaSearch/

Notes:

- supports the badly-in-need publish/find/bind SDI workflow, allowing
users to discover data/services and add them to their map
- OGC services are seamlessly supported for dynamic add layer dialogues
- over 1300 downloads in the last 6 weeks from plugins.qgis.org
- interest across multiple organizations and countries (development,
pull requests, documentation, feature requests/enhancements/bug
reports, translation, etc.)
- documentation: currently Sphinx, hosted on GitHub, translated on Transifex
- extensible, future work will include additional APIs (OpenSearch, etc.)
- initially forked from the excellent CSWClient work by NextGIS

Dependencies:
- user: https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/blob/master/requirements.txt
- developer: https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/blob/master/requirements-dev.txt
- managed in https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/blob/master/pavement.py#L60
- OWSLib is a hard requirement
- I'd be willing to move off Jinja2 (HTML templating) and pygments
(Syntax highlighting) in favour of something already in QGIS; these
are self contained in
https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/blob/master/plugin/MetaSearch/util.py#L55
and https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/blob/master/plugin/MetaSearch/util.py#L103,
if there are easy alternatives already supported in the QGIS Python
environment
- I'm not familiar with QGIS development/build workflow/etc., so I'm
not sure how the dependencies are/will be handled. Does/will QGIS have
a Python package dependency strategy?

Build/packaging:
- uses Paver to build, package, bundle and upload to plugins.qgis.org
- **dependencies are bundled with the plugin in isolation**
- how does/would this look in a QGIS build?

Issues:

- UI: thanks to Anita, Tim and others on UI comments and development
in Vienna last week.  We are working on these in master branch
currently
- default connections file: there is interest in organizations
publishing their CSW to this list as a means to have it default in
QGIS. Current process at
https://github.com/geopython/MetaSearch/wiki/MetaSearch-Default-Connections-List.
 We have Travis CI setup to always test the default connections so the
list does not become stale over time (as well as pep8 checks, etc.)

I hope this provides enough of an overview to move the discussion forward.

Thanks for consideration.

Hi,

Layer title and name are only the same if the title in the metadata is
not set (see metadata tab of a layer). If you set the title in the
metadata tab it will be different from the name in the GetCapabilities
response.

Naming the same layer twice: it's just bad practice. Authors should not
do that. Many plugins also rely on the fact that the same layer name
does not appear multiple times (or how would you distinguish layers
(e.g. in a combobox) if the same layer name is used multiple times?)

I would just tell users: don't do that. It's your own fault if you do it.

I wouldn't mind if you add the layer id in the GetProjectSettings
command (in addition to layer and title, not instead of), but I don't
think that the layer id's should be exposed in GetCapabilities.

Hi

It will be great to have CSW functionality in QGIS out of the box!

PS: The italian national catalog (RNDT) was recently added to the plugin
thanks to a proficous dialog netween some people in the italian gfoss
mailing list and the national agency.

I agree, but it would be fine if QGIS would deny to create layers with same
name, rather than to rely on user's decision.

OK, we are in process of preparing patch which will add multiple new
parameters to GetProjectSettings. We will include also layer ID.

Hi all.
How about adding some popular, well tested plugin of general usage to
main QGIS? We have done this in the past, e.g. for fTools, GDALTools, DB
Manager etc., and they were good additions to QGIS.
Currently the most downloaded (DESC) are:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/openlayers_plugin/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/tablemanager/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mmqgis/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GeoCoding/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/cadtools/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/xytools/
I believe they are all good candidates, plus possibly more.
Opinions?
All the best.

I think it's a great idea.

+1 for openlayers, once it works with master (I don't use the others)

how about adding value tool?

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/valuetool/

But we need to fix the pyqwt bug with debian before including it in main
QGIS.

I think it's a great idea, I was actually thinking about this the other day
and glad you brought the topic.

Although we can install plugins certainly it becomes evident when a plugin
should really become a core feature, example the Openlayers Plugin, I bet
almost all people using QGIS downloads it before doing anything with QGIS.
Plugins extend QGIS functionality beyond what initially was thought but in
many cases plugins become a must to be able to work efficiently

If the plugins are added to core I would vote for blending the functions
coherently with the rest of the interface in the appropriate menus. A good
example would be CAD tools which I would say be called Advanced Editing or
something.

I would add 

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/zoomtocoordinates/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/numericalDigitize/  - needs to add case for
geographic coordinates

I agree that adding the plugins to core would be a good idea however I
don't feel that we should just add them in their current state.  The plugin
repository has the benefit of of being able to update things faster then
the release of QGIS itself if you find bugs, etc, you can also add features
for older QGIS versions.

I think these features in the plugins are great but we should really
integrate them into the core project itself as new features rather then
just a plugin.   Having Python plugins in core can also raise issue for
users because they still look like normal plugins but you can't update them
because they are no longer in the repository.  Having to enable handy
features also feels a bit hap hazard to me.

Something like the value tool could easily be integrated into the identify
tool for instance.   There are also some other concepts floating around the
idea of bring CAD functions into core so I think it's best to just focus on
making those stronger.

So +1 for adding the functions but -1 for just bringing the plugins into
core.

- Nathan

I agree completely with what you have written specially "+1 for adding the functions but -1 for just bringing the plugins into core." Maybe start with some of the easier ones like the value tool you mention

I agree that adding the plugins to core would be a good idea however I don't feel that we should just add them in their current state.  The plugin repository has the benefit of of being able to update things faster then the release of QGIS itself if you find bugs, etc, you can also add features for older QGIS versions.


I think these features in the plugins are great but we should really integrate them into the core project itself as new features rather then just a plugin.   Having Python plugins in core can also raise issue for users because they still look like normal plugins but you can't update them because they are no longer in the repository.  Having to enable handy features also feels a bit hap hazard to me.  


Something like the value tool could easily be integrated into the identify tool for instance.   There are also some other concepts floating around the idea of bring CAD functions into core so I think it's best to just focus on making those stronger.


So +1 for adding the functions but -1 for just bringing the plugins into core.

You have to activate the remote controle inside JOSM using the icon with
the switches, then the remote control icon.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Considerations around WFS layer and ArcGIS REST
	API Connector Plugin
Message-ID: <CAFcOn29rz_oAmTv90GajMr8ie26QeeetVUWoBsDQCW6APkKoig@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Devs,

Tobias and I are working on the "ArcGIS REST API Connector Plugin" which
reads WFS- and WMTS-alike services (called Feature Service and Map Service)
from ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Server 10.x. Let's call this a connection of
type "ArcGIS Layer", which creates a vector layer (in memory).

1. When entering a new WFS Layer connection and loading it as a new project
layer, I know that the WFS URL is stored in the project file - and Username
and Password (as hash?) also are stored there, right?

2. WFS can be deliver huge number of features. A WFS layer obviously reads
all(!) features into memory when loading first time. Should'nt be there a
limit "Max. no. features" per connection in the WFS connection (and in
ours) in order to prevent memory overflow? (if this is considered a hack, a
local indexed cache file would become necessary...).

3. Since WFS is a service, it can be updated anytime and the WFS layer in
QGIS becomes outdated.Should'nt be there a "Refresh" button in the WFS
layer (and in ours)?

4. How can the QGIS project file be extended in order to a) store
additional parameters - like this "Max. no. features" - per layer. And b):
how can an own connection type - like ArcGIS Layer - be added to the
project file, so that QGIS calls our plugin, when the project/layer is
(re-)loaded?

5. WFS "only" supports basic authentication. How about NTLM [2] and OAuth?

Yours,
Stefan

Are there plans to let plugins (which are not working well with  
multi-threaded rendering) deactivate the feature when needed?

Thanks and best wishes,

the processing/sextante plugin is both in core and also can be updated.
Same thing for ftools and gdaltools.

I agree, more or less - I thought about integrating it into the main
identify tool, but as it works with raster layers only, how would you
display raster and vector layers?

Not sure they would make it into core then, as development cost fof
integrating into core is much higher than adding them as core python
modules. For instance, the openlayer plugin would probably need quite a lot
of work to be ported to c++.

On the other hand, anything that relies on qwt would be better handled.
Butanthing that uses python plotting libraries would obviously not work.

Perhaps the proposal is really, which plugins to ship by default?
Which sounds the same but is slightly different or could be interpreted
differently as add the plugins to core.

I'm +1 for adding a few more default plugins to the distribution,
especially if they are very common in usage. Remember though, there is a
trade-off, putting too many things in the default interface is
overwhelming for some levels of users. It makes GIS more daunting than
it needs to be.

Thanks,
Alex

PS: Hotmail is known to reject osgeo mailing lists. Wondering if that
magically got fixed.

I would love to have this feature when exploring new datasets. In 
addition to the checkbox for each layer, another (smaller?) checkbox 
could be added near each class, allowing to easily toggle visibility of 
each class. It would also need a way to toggle all classes visibility at 
once.

This is actually trivial on the UI side, but I don't know how easy it is 
to control the rendering of a single class ?

I think most users would have to download a few plugins before even
considering using QGIS, which ones I certainly don't know since that would
require community input via a poll or something but I would imagine a few
should be installed by default like Processing e.g. Openlayers plugin once
it's fixed

Maybe another thing to consider is that bugs that affect shipped by default
plugins could become blockers? For example the very popular Openlayers
plugin is still broken in master

P.S. I haven't had issues with Hotmail until now

Message-ID: <1396722001004-5133306.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi is it possible to sync the plugins from one machine across all the
machines I use QGIS? Here is the situation

I normally work with QGIS on my personal laptop, I have downloaded and
tested several plugins and I have kept the ones I want. When I go to my
office I work on my workstation but I then have to remember what plugins I
use or I think I have a plugin installed while that isn't true. What I would
like is some way for QGIS to sync plugin from a web file I have shared on a
public accessible place be that github, dropbox, etc.

Ideas? I would love to have an automatic solution that doesn't involve
copy/paste some file each time I need to sync plugins since that would be
error prone

I think you already found the answer, symlink a folder that you keep in
dropbox (or other sync service). Or just add the Dropbox subfolder to
the plugin search path - I just noticed the dialog in the QGIS options
says it's only for C++ plugins, so maybe an enhancement request.


Note you may want to exclude .pyc files as those are not platform
independent.

Thanks,
Alex

Hmm but that would require putting all the plugin files in sync right?

I was thinking of something like QGIS generates automatically a list of
installed plugins and updates a txt file to a path, it could be on the
computer and I can upload to somewhere or to a folder which syncs
automatically etc.

Then QGIS would have the option to add the URL to this file and detect when
new plugins have been added or deleted and then sync to repository.

I will try how you suggest and see how it works out

I realized that we're no longer running any php based websites. Can
someone verify that?

If true we can try switching off Apache prefork for worker which is
multi-threaded and might perform better.

Thanks,

Hi Alex,

I think you are right... but others, please let us know if we are wrong!

Other point: although qgis.org website is as responsive as before,
actually doing something on the server is awfully slow (currently trying
to start a sphinx buildscript... it looks like it takes seconds for
every file to write....)?? Also opening a file in vim takes a long time??

Is this related to the problems with the other server, or are we sharing
resources now or os?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Disk I/O is the current issue on the underlying hardware. Raid card
batteries are in the mail already, which we believe is the root cause. A
few days ago it was the raid rebuild causing it with the replacement
disk in. So please avoid heavy disk usage for a few days.

My comments above are actually all about reducing the I/O to make it
perform better.
http://blog.phusion.nl/2013/03/12/tuning-phusion-passengers-concurrency-settings/

We've also been making tweaks to kernel scheduling, disk read ahead,
swapiness, etc. All of this is actually helping make page serving even
faster despite the disk bottleneck.

Thanks,
Alex

Well, there is actually something in QGIS already, with which can you
use a custom directory for all your plugins and settings.

Try to start QGIS with the extra parameters '--configpath'
(to see all options: try 'qgis.exe --help')

if on windows, edit the bat file that starts QGIS, with something like:

qgis.exe --configpath c:\temp\myqgisconfig

this does 2 things:
1) it switches Qt on windows to write setting to ini file format
(instead of registry), so that is much more portable
2) instead of the .qgis2 directory in your USER dir, it will create
exact that structure and put all plugins you install in that dir

so now: you can share the myqgisconfig dir (which is actually a
.qgis2-like dir) between several computers, ti will both contain a
CONFIG/QGIS/QGIS2.ini (with all your settings) as a python/olugins dir
with all your downloaded plugins) Be as creative as possible on how to
share do this.

(with the other option --optionspath you can point qgis to a share
QSettingsfile ( ini-format! ).

Hope this helps, Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Anita,

I don't think this could be done nor should it be.

What iisues do you have with your time manager and MTR?

The export image series does not work properly anymore: it sometimes saves  
before the map is done rendering.

Maybe there's some signal I could use?

Yeah there is a renderComplete() or renderJobFinsihed.  I think you need to
use renderJobFinished.

Thanks!
The process is currently controlled by a timer object. Do you know what's  
best practice to combine a time + waiting for a signal?

Best wishes,

I have implemented most features of the Identify Tool plugin to the main

Seems code will have to move away from a timer and instead trigger
rendering on determined timeout which will trigger another timeout upon
renderJobFinish if timemanager is playing / exporting.

MRT has greatly improved interaction with timemanager time slider btw.

Agreed, that's why I was calling for a common decision.
My suggestion is to disable by default those with a complex interface
(e.g. CAD Tools).
I suggest to do it for 2.4, at least for the three most popular:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/openlayers_plugin/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/tablemanager/
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/mmqgis/
In my experience, these are effectively hidden features for many QGIS users.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building on OSX -
	QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource
Message-ID: <1396774323027-5133371.post@n6.nabble.com>

Environment: OSX Lion

This is a frustrating one.  The other day after following the build
instructions  I was able to build the main QGIS src tree successfully.

However, today I had to make a fresh build (of just the main tree) and kept
getting stuck here:

/dev/cpp/QGIS/src/core/qgsvectorlayerfeatureiterator.cpp:87: error: class
?QgsVectorLayerFeatureIterator? does not have any field named
?QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource?
/dev/cpp/QGIS/src/core/qgsvectorlayerfeatureiterator.cpp:88: error: no
matching function for call to
?QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource<QgsVectorLayerFeatureSource>::QgsAbstractFeatureIteratorFromSource()?


It is almost certainly something environmental and likely trivial, but being
new to the dev. environment I post this here in the hope someone can point
me in the right direction quickly.

Thank you.

Hi,

I agree there are some plugin which could be added by default, whenever
QGIS has no approaching feature like Openlayers plugin.
For some plugins such as tablemanager, I think we would better add the
features in core, to let the user modify the fields in the Fields tab of
the layer properties, and not in an other plugin dialog.

Don't you think that adding mmqgis plugin into core will cause a lot
of confusion, considering that its algorithms are already integrated
in Processing (even with bug fixes in some cases)?

I agree that it would be a great thing to have the OpenLayers plugin
(or at least a similalar functionality) available by default in core

Hi,

I need the painter from the renderComplete signal? Could you help me with

I have:

and

    def waitAfterRenderComplete(self, painter):

but waitAfterRenderComplete does not receive a painter.

Thanks and best wishes,

Anita, just saw you commited a fix. Thanks!

May I suggest a small improvement? You should calculate the time it took,
in ms, to render canvas and deduce that ms value from the
animationFrameLength ms value in your singleShot call:

QTimer.singleShot(self.animationFrameLength,self.playAnimation)

Currently if you have a 1000ms frame length and canvas rendering takes
500ms, each frame will last 1500ms. Deducing the 500ms canvas rendering
time from frame length will fix this.  If rendering ms > frame length ms,
that'd allow you to skip singleShot and render next frame immediately.

Cheers and thanks again.

oh. right. why then keeping it also separated? could the author be asked to merge his
job in Processing? I think keeping both may be confusing.

It seems that we all agree on this could you write the list, so we'll ask Pirmin?

I'm not 100% sure on this, but isn't the OpenLayers plugin a bit
legally murky? I'm pretty sure that it's either  violating the Google
maps terms of service or if not, it's cutting it pretty close. I know
the Viking GPS program ran into issues back in 2008 with their
in-built support for google maps layers [1][2] and were forced to
remove this support.

Having OpenLayers as a non-official plugin gives us some distance from
issues like this - if we make this a core feature then we are
effectively endorsing this functionality and may be opening ourselves
to potential legal issues.

I had the exact same concern. Without a clear note from Google indicating that 
this plugin is ok, I think the risk is pretty high of licence violation. 
Google maps is supposed to be accessed only "from a browser" and not from a 
desktop application behaving like a browser.
It would be a pain for users if we add this plugin and then we have to remove 
it on Google's demand.

A good solution though would be to remove google layers and only use OSM and 
mapbox layers, which begin to be on par in terms of quality. Or let the user a 
deliberate way to add google layers (indicating a URL or something like this), 
warning him about the licence.

Hi Richard,

The situation improved, the server does not only indicate, that it's 
running, but serves real pages.
However, when I type http://planet.qgis.org into my address bar I 
expect it to open the planet and not the "new QGIS Web Application", I 
think a simple redirect to /planet/ would do the trick ;-)

Best
Matthias

Good point. I thought of it, but haven't implemented it yet since I
would have to keep track of the rendering time.
Please file a feature request so this idea does not get lost.

I'm still looking for a solution to the main topic of this thread
(painter refrence) because I think it could help solve the latest
issue concerning the timestamp label.

Currently I see there are two instances:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/sextante/issues

I think this is confusing for both reporters and developers, can we merge them?

For WMS and WCS, Username and Password are saved with the URL and are

No there are no plans to allow deactivation of rendering in
background. I think it would be a step back... it would bring
inconsistent user experience and more code complexity. I understand it
brings a bit of inconvenience to some plugins, but at the same time I
believe it would take less time to fix problems with all affected
plugins than introduce again the rendering in main thread (and options
for plugins to request it).

Cheers

Martin,

Both those signals are the same and work the same. The newer .connect
method is the better way.

Maybe that was to rule out something else.

Apropos does either connect actually return True?

Yeah, anyway I checked again and even original Anita's statement
worked for me. This is what I did in python console:

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
class A(QObject):
  def __init__(self): QObject.__init__(self)
  def f(self, painter): import sys; sys.__stdout__.write("hello\n")
a = A()
iface.mapCanvas().renderComplete.connect(a.f)

when moving the map, it will output "hello" to the system console from
where I started QGIS... so problem is probably somewhere else, not
with connection itself.


> Apropos does either connect actually return True?

I have learned not to trust the return value of connect() at all, for example:

>>> QObject.connect(iface.mapCanvas(), SIGNAL("abracadabra()"), a.f)
True

I'm pretty sure map canvas cannot do this kind of magic!

I'm pretty sure this is against MapBox's terms of service too, unless
users were made to sign up for a MapBox account and had to add their
individual API key to QGIS to unlock MapBox layers:
"You must have a Mapbox account to use Mapbox. You are required to
register for an account before using the Service. Each request to the
API must include your account's unique API identifier. Unauthorized
use of any API identifier is prohibited." [1]

Hmm... while this may be a workable solution to the licensing issue,
wouldn't it be a step back in functionality anyway? We'd be trading
having a good, working off-the-shelf third-party plugin for a crippled
core version which takes user intervention to unlock the same
features.

I'm totally for adding essential plugins to core (or merging the
functionality with reimplemented c++ versions), but I honestly don't
know if it's workable to do this for the OpenLayers plugin.

Also, when it comes to OSM, IMO proper TMS support should be what is
(eventually) offered as implemented feature to users. That'd allow for OSM
basemaps to also export properly in qgis composer. OpenLayer' layers not
exporting well in qgis composer is a pretty big limitation.

Maybe a simple UI to wrap around GDAL's internal TMS support?

Right, I had not read this through. It would probably be much easier to get a 
specific authorization from MapBox than from Google though, given their open-
source orientation.

In any case, there are quite a lot of OSM based layers which can be used (HOT, 
OSM.fr, OpenCycleMap...). We can still enhance the plugin with those.
It would lack an aerial imagery layer though.

Right, if we remove everything from the plugin except the TMS YXZ layers, we 
could also just have a better ergonomy for opening this kind of layers through 
GDAL, and have a predefined list of layers accessible on internet (even auto-
updatable by downloading the list).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Composer preview modes - looking for testing and
	advice
Message-ID: <CAB28Ashf8waaj-8gvPdize06_V1LLSDFovO3Zgqk9_=Jbn55Uw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just sent through a pull request which implements interactive
preview modes to the composer. These allow you to instantly see what
your composition would look like in grayscale, b&w, or for color blind
people. The pull request is here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1294

HOWEVER - there's an issue somewhere in the code which I can't track
down (or replicate). In Nathan's testing switching on any of these
preview modes stops the composer view widget from repainting
(effectively freezing the composer) until the effect is disabled. I've
tested this feature on a range of windows and linux environments but
can't reproduce this or figure out why it is happening for Nathan. So,
any advice from any qt experts on what is going wrong here would be
greatly appreciated...

Cheers,
Nyall

Not with the field calculator, but you can use the advanced python one
also in Processing.

Hi list! 
I'm happy to announce the first release of opeNoise (v.0.1), an experimental QGIS plugin that allows to compute the noise level generated by road traffic at fixed receiver points and buildings. 


I hope it can be useful and you want to test it and give me some feedback. 


You can download it from the QGIS official repository (experimental plugins). 


Thanks to all! 
All the best, 
Stefano 


MORE INFO: 
The plugin is created by Arpa Piemonte ( www.arpa.piemonte.it ), with the support of Citt? di Torino (www.comune.torino.it). Contacts: s.masera at arpa.piemonte.it, enrico.gallo at comune.torino.it. 


The calculation is based on the French national computation method NMPB-Routes-96, as indicated in the DIRECTIVE 2002/49/EC OF THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND OF THE COUNCIL of 25 June 2002 relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise. 


Please consider the following semplifications: 
- the modelization is 2D (only the distance receiver points - roads is calculated considering the receiver points at 4m on the ground); 
- no reflections or diffractions are calculated; 
- the terrain is flat.

Hi Paolo,

now Processing is as subproject of QGIS (thanks to Alex Mandel).
All Processing tickets now should be visible in QGIS bugtracker, also
you can use custom query on the right panel [0] to filter only Processing
tickets.

If you need to create new ticket for Processing, you need to use its
bugtracker [1], as for now there is no way to create ticket in subproject
from main tracker.

Alex, please, correct me if I'm wrong.

If I understand correctly, this is redmine limitation. Alex can
clarify this better then me

There is also another option ? move all Processing tickets
into main QGIS tracker. But in this case we will lose all ticket
groups and will have only one group called "Processing".

I prefer this option. As for the groups, we can always create Processing_grass,
Processing_gui, etc.

Since the OpenLayers plugin does not (currently) work with master, perhaps
we can replace it with TMS-based layers, wither through a plugin or as a
native (GDAL-based) provider?

Is there anything in OpenLayers that could not work with GDAL TMS
mini-driver [1] ?

Thanks for the links. Most of this information is also available at [1].

I am preparing a simple plugin to load these layers  as raster layers, will
keep you updated on this.

Hi !

I agree with those saying it's better to integrate the features of
top-plugin in the core, if we find the features are worth it, and if
someone has the time to do so, rather than shipping dozens of preinstalled
plugin.

I don't like the impression it gives to have a brand new software already
"bloated" by plugins, which you never really know what they do and if it's
OK or not to remove them.

A better alternative IMO is to display the "featured" plugins category as a
tab in the plugin manager, but not to preinstall them.
It could even become the default page of the plugin manager.

I personally feel much better when adding by myself suggested plugins than
when hesitating to remove a plugin which I'm not really sure what it's
about but seems kinda-important since it already was installed...

About this, please consider this ticket also :
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9405

Cheers !

Olivier

Ok. cracked it.  But in the process ended up upgrading to Mavericks to
install Xcode 5+.

A few tips for those building on OSX.

- The homebrew installers are helpful for the dependencies
- use make rather than make -j# on the main build

 From what I could figure out so far, I only get the painter into  
playAnimation() if I do the following trick with lambda:

QTimer.singleShot(self.animationFrameLength, lambda:  
self.playAnimation(painter))

But even then, the exported images are without label ...

Best wishes,
Anita

I actually do not see the difference between a core plugin a something
implemented directly in the core c++ code. Other than the extra time
it might take to develop it. The user doesn't have to know it is a
plugin, and it should be easy to actually remove a core plugin from
the plugin manager (like black-listing it), so it doesn't appear
there.

Hi Victor

For me, core features (and not core plugins) are much more integrated into
QGIS ui and dialogs. For example, tablemanager plugins adds some nice
features , but they should be integrated in the Fields tab of the vector
layer properties. Having the features separated in a plugin (core or not
core) adds complexity for users.

For other plugins like mmqgis, which brings a list of algorithms , I agree
there is no big difference between plugin and feature.

I think we won't find a common rule for all the plugins. We should have a
look plugin by plugin, otherwise our discussion will go in every direction.

Michael

I agree, each plugin is a different world. It's true that core
development can bring further integration, but maybe moving plugins to
core is a good moment to rethink how plugins can integrate in the QGIS
interface and allow new ways of interacting (for instance, making it
easy for a plugin to add elements to the properties window, or new
context menus when right-clicking in an element, etc). That's
currently limited (or maybe not well documented), and most plugin
developers tend to do the most tipical thing and add a menu entry in
the "plugins" menu. That is most of the time not the best thing to
do...and clearly not the way to go for a core plugin.

Message-ID: <CA+TxYvP1r34CCnstKxYV9U6fya74ThNFA2kwS8dXMWZ24tyeFw@mail.gmail.com>

I have put together a simple plugin to load a number of TMS layers using
the GDAL TMS mini-driver [1]. I see it as a simple alternative to the more
complete OpenLayers plugin.

Code is at github for now [2]. Any suggestions are welcome (including
plugin name). Also if you have any other working examples please let me
know.

Supported layers are OSM, Google, and other examples given in [1] (except
those that don't work).

Tested with QGIS 2.2 and master. Rendering of labels is not the best but it
seems better with master.

Nice, few comments (based on my previous uses of the GDAL TMS mini-driver):
- your plugin should make sure the loaded layer is assigned the proper
projection (mostly pseudo-mercator); failing to do so will leave must users
unable to understand why the TMS rendering fails
- that would also switch OTF reprojection on when needed
- consider adding TMS of the Global Forest Change (see
http://www.earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest for
data source, and
https://www.flickr.com/photos/60284107 at N00/11096344994/in/pool-qgis-screenshotsfor
in-QGIS example)

The GDAL TMS driver is in many ways a superior solution to OpenLayers; it
works perfectly fine with the multi-thread rendering, can be exported via
qgis composer, caches the tiles, etc.

Hi,

If you are using Homebrew, consider adding the OSGeo4Mac tap [0], and
trying out the qgis-22 formula. The tap is still in a 'beta' state. If you
find any issues, please post them to the site's tracker.

Matthieu,

Thanks for your input!

I will change the project CRS by default but make it optional.

Do you have a xml file for the TMS of the Global Forest Change, or any info
on what server it uses or at least the path?

While working on it I realized the power of the caching - I am taking
advantage of that and setting the proper cache directory.

cheers
Etienne

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Aliases of features attributes in Mapserver's WMS
 GetProjectSettings and GetFeatureInfo
Message-ID: <CAKeJj68BHJvq+xWYY3UpHD2CGFU6V4=HF+pbDhqAiBAGBtfyEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I found some issues in Mapserver when using aliases for features
attributes.

GetProjectSetting response has features attributes of vector layer in this
form

<Attribute typeName="INTEGER" precision="0" length="0" editType="LineEdit"
type="qlonglong" comment="" name="PK_UID"/>

where "name" property contains either attribute's alias (if defined) or its
name. So you are loosing attribute's name when using aliases, and that make
it impossible to perform searching by this attribute with GetFeatureInfo
request (with FILTER parameter). Separate "alias" property would be much
better.

Another question is, what should be used as attribute name in
GetFeatureInfo response, alias or name? Current mapserver returns prefer
aliases (if defined) in plain XML format, but in GML format it always
returns names. In my opinion, names should be used in both formats and
aliases could be passed as additional info (if particular format allows
that), or not used at all in GetFeatureInfo cause clients would be able to
perform mapping from names to aliases by info from GetProjectSettings.

And the last issue is that mapserver always returns all features attributes
in GetFeatureInfo response is GML format, even if they are marked to be
excluded in WMS server.


I have all these issues fixed and I can create a pull requests, but first I
want to discuss about it and maybe another solutions will came out.

Hi Marcel,

have you seen this [1]?
Clearly mapserver should stick to either name or alias in _all_ 
responses. As (I assume) name is unique (because it must be unique in 
the data source) and alias may not (because it is a user setting), 
mapserver should use the name and (as proposed by you) additionally 
provide the alias at least in GetProjectSettings. No idea if 
GetCapabilities and GetFeatureInfo should return the alias, too, because 
they are standardized requests.

Bernhard

Hi Marcel

Sounds good to have both name and alias in GetProjectSettings and to use 
name for FILTER.

 >Another question is, what should be used as attribute name in 
GetFeatureInfo response, alias or name? Current mapserver returns prefer 
aliases (if defined) in plain XML format, >but in GML format it always 
returns names. In my opinion, names should be used in both formats and 
aliases could be passed as additional info (if particular format allows 
that), >or not used at all in GetFeatureInfo cause clients would be able

I think it should behave similar to the info-tool in QGIS and give the 
alias. Standard WMS clients can then display the text / html without 
being aware there is a difference between name/alias. Specialised 
clients (e.g. QGIS webclient, Lizmap, ...) can read alias / name from 
project settings and use that for filter string (which is also 
non-standard).

 >but in GML format it always returns names
 >And the last issue is that mapserver always returns all features 
attributes in GetFeatureInfo response is GML format, even if they are 
marked to be excluded in WMS server.

These are two bugs in the gml featureInfo code.

Pull requests are welcome. However, to avoid merging conflicts, it might 
be good to wait for https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1296 .

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <5343C925.4030209@carto.net>

Hi,

The new layer-choice mode with the drop-down menu is great. It should be
the default mode of the identify tool in the future, in my opinion.

However, I saw that if there is a single result you still get the layer
choice menu with just a single choice. This could be improved to open
the form directly without having to make a choice first. We have a an
option in the "Map Tools" settings called "Open feature form, if a
single feature is identified" - in my opinion this setting should be
honored if checked.

Who did this layer choice implementation? Could this be improved?

Ah and are the geometry type icons still missing on master (just in front of the layer name)?

Hi Andreas

Marco H. did the implementation funded by us. 

I would not connect it with the "open feature form..." option but open the identify result without asking if there is only one layer. Asking doesn't make sense from my point of view.

Good to know about your work on Server config redesign, I will wait until
you finish it.

I have looked into source code and found one drawback for using aliases in
GetFeatureInfo request in GML format. Attribute name is encoded as XML
element and therefore it cannot contain empty spaces. Because of that,
empty spaces are now replaced with "_" and this will make attribute name
looks less user friendly. So in my case it doesn't really matter that much
whether alias or name will be returned, there always will be needed some
post-processing of GML document before showing result to the user.

And one other question that raise after Bernhard's reply. If
GetProjectSettings will have both "alias" and "name" attributes, does it
somehow change the "displayField" attribute of Layer's element? Cause now
it is also filled by alias value (or name if alias is not defined).

This is my second time to write to you , but I don't know if you can receive my e-mail , cause I'm from China , we have some limites on the Internet . 


So  the problem is , I can't find many tutorials from the website , I?m using C++ and Qt for developing . I have read the tutorial in the source code package  from Tim Sutton , by the way thank you Tim , you gave me a very good tutorial to start QGis . But that's not enough , I have found there are some Python tutorials , but never much C++ tutorial , just API document . I want some papers about how the classes in QGis is constructed and how what can the do . 

I know maybe that's greed to send to you  and ask for some maritals , but I want to work with QGis , and I like QGis , so can?t find some C++ tutorial with QGis really make me mad!

If you read my e-mail , please write back to me , that?s important to me because only this way I can know wether  you can receive my letter or not .




Thank you very much , you  gays really did a fantastic work .

Hi Guys,
Is there a trick to installing QGIS (and the whole pile of Gdal, Grass, 
Ossim etc) on the latest ubuntu?
I get a lot of dependencies that cannot be met.

The purpose of this installation is to learn to write plugins for QGIS, 
and to  play around with Ossim and Grass.
I don't mind compiling from source if need be.

Can someone please point me to the way forward?

Thanks in advance,
Zoltan

while working with QGIS plus pgadmin and/or psql I often need to close
DB Manager or even QGIS entirely in oder to be able to perform some

Is there any way to avoid this?

What versions are affected - dev / 2.2 / both?
What happens with QGIS / DB manager open? Waiting indefinitely / crash / ... ?

Maybe you are running out of available connections on the PostgreSQL
server - increasing their number in server configuration may help.

I think both, for sure on master.


> What happens with QGIS / DB manager open? Waiting indefinitely / crash / ... ?


it happens that pgadmin/psql operations remain "freezed", then when
closing qgis they immediately start and finish as expected.

on my local machine, for local work (just one user connected, me) I
have set postgresql.conf to accept max 100 connections, and still this
issue.
Should I put an higher value?

Using Google Maps via TMS URL's is against their TOS. That's also the reason, 
why I didn't approve the similar Tile Map Scale Plugin [1] yet.

Hi
Thanks for the thumbs up.
Can you explain if using Google Maps with the OpenLayers plugin respects
their TOS? Do you have any links for Google TOS using both tiles and web
view (used in OpenLayers)?

thanks Etienne

Me, too. This problem is present as far as I use QGIS together with 
PostGIS (QGIS 1.5 maybe). As far as I can remember only DDL statements 
(e.g. ALTER TABLE) are affected, whereas e.g. SELECT works as expected.
However I do not remember running into this in the last couple of months 
but this was maybe just luck :)
What has to be investigated, too, is if it happens with the same db user 
(role) accessing a table through QGIS and pgadmin. Background is I have 
dozens of db roles accessing the db with QGIS and as said above did not 
run into this problem recently when administrating the db with pgadmin.
Anybody has an idea what the reason is? Does QGIS lock a table so it 
cannot be altered?

Looks up to date now. What I'm really wondering, is if upgrading Phusion
would help with the weird out of control memory usage. I've been kicking
manually every day, for some reason the cron job doesn't work anymore,
though the weigh-passengers script does.

It looks like a newer version is available and their is also an option
to run a standalone, reverse proxied behind another server.

I'll suggest we give upgrading a shot from the phusion repos. That
should just work and is much simpler than a redmine upgrade.

Anyone want to help?

Thanks,
Alex

The cron job just kicks apache when it stops to respond - and only if the
unresponsiveness is still there on the next run (ie. after 5 minutes).

Killing it again and again will "corrupt" the database (eg. lead to missing
commits) - that's why it doesn't always kill anymore.

I remember this problem and have been looking into it some 2 years ago 
(estimated). My conclusion then was (if I remember correctly) that the 
psycopg2 transaction is not commited and thus locks the relation. 
(Closing DB manager closes the connection and thus terminates all 
transactions). Maybe setting the connection to autocommit solves this 
issue? I did not care any further because I do not use DB manager (but 
pgAdmin) for two reasons:
1) the named problem (it locks tables)
2) the need to install psycopg2 on all my clients' computers (IMHO a db 
plugin for QGIS should use QtSql because one can assume that it is 
installed).

but this Problem is (as far as I understand) not related to the problem 
described in the OP: tables are locked because they are loaded as layers 
into QGIS

Hi QGIS Developers

I have written a QGIS plugin but I am struggling to upload it to the
repository.

I get the following error

[image: Inline images 1]
In my zip file I have a metadata.txt and the __init__.py file but it is in
the top level.

The uploading seems to only look in the folders and not the rest of the zip
file.

I have checked other plugins and they all have these files at the top level

Can someone please help me get my zip uploaded?

Thanks in advance

Tim

I see now that in "pgadmin -> tools -> server status" there are a lot
of locks after adding postgis layers in qgis and that they do
disappear only when closing qgis itself. Pressing "new project" does
not remove the locks.

Hi!

as the plugins are getting unzipped in the plugins folder (in the users
home directory) each plugin has to have it's own folder (to not interfer
with other plugins).
So the zip file has to have a folder first - and inside the folder the
plugin code ..

plugin.zip
+pluginname(folder)
  +metadata.txt
  +anotherfolder
  +programcode

Hope this helps
Werner

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Removing project from hub
Message-ID: <CALuHMPDShnAP=n+WLb_YV5mPhYP+Sb5sJWcip16Qg3n_UnBk0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

is it possible to remove project from QGIS Hub? For example we
decided to move issues of some plugins to GitHub and don't need
projects at QGIS hub anymore.

How such requests handled?

Thanks

This was the problem I was having a few months ago before 2.2 was released. I would run queries and they would never disappear on the server. So eventually the queries would stop running as the number of connections reached 100. 

I only got around it by adding layers and specifying that the layer does not look for styles in the PostGIS database (the False at the end there).

vlayer = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layerName, "postgres", False)

I don't know if it is related to the code that looks for styles in the database, and if doesn't find one it doesn't shut down the connection?

I see now that in "pgadmin -> tools -> server status" there are a lot of locks after adding postgis layers in qgis and that they do disappear only when closing qgis itself. Pressing "new project" does not remove the locks.

Tim,

did you check if this information is in the manual?

http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/

If it isn't, can you add it?

hi alessandro

I had read the info on this page

http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/plugins.html

There is an example of the directory structure, but I just hadn't zipped my
plugin folder. I had zipped my plugin files instead

So all sorted now

thanks

Tim

Ok, I just wanted to point out that if you can imagine how to improve the
cookbook documentation, please just do it (TM)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] What is it done for : add expression capabilities

Message-ID: <5346B042.2020506@gmail.com>

Hi dev,

I just found a new commit :
ff467dadd53e7162f34a5280f9afcfbad8f83c5b
add expression capabilities to the field model
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/ff467dadd53e7162f34a5280f9afcfbad8f83c5b

It's promising but there is no issue on hub.qgis.org or on github 
associated and no description about the commit.
This commit has been merged for doing what ?

Hello everybody,
I was wondering about correcting the code concerning the integration of the FUSION software in the Processing, due to some wrong dependencies or panel adjustments that can turn useful.
Unfortunately, being a newbie, quite a lot of questions arise:

Shall I ask to you (opening a ticket) or may I do it by myself? if the last: how to and where do I find the code?

In the case I'm able to do it quickly, when and to who shall I send the correct code to have it included in the 2.4 version?

Many thanks in advance for the support,

Niccol?

Hi Paolo,

this is known issue with upgrading complex plugins, not only
Processing. I suspect that plugin manager can't correctly reload
plugin after upgrade.

Search for "you must not access map tiles" in the TOS 
(https://developers.google.com/maps/terms). That's why the OpenLayers plugin 
is using only the Javascript API with a WebKit Browser.

Name the project in question. I think we can disable it so it doesn't

Hi Alex,

this project is QTiles. But please don't disable it right now, I want
to move all tickets to github first. Also we will try to fix this bugs and
close issues at hub, so interested users will get notifications and will
not create duplicates issues.

Hi all.
In previous versions (up to 1.8, I believe) it was possible to save queries in a .qpf
file. Now this possibility seems gone: am I missing something?

Hi list,

I'm testing QGIS 2.2 with connection to my Oracle spatial enterprise DB.
When I try to edit point layer, moving object function is disabled.
With postgis layer,  function is enabled.

Is it a bug?

Thanks

Hi all,

I keep on trying to create a package for windows with the
**creatensis** script.
Launching the script normally, the package is created and it works
nice (I tested it on a Virtualbox machine).

I saw that the creatensis has various options, and I have just a few
(simple) questions about the customization and the packaging itself:

- - how can I specify the version of QGIS I want to create? I cannot
understand how should I use the **-version** option.

- - if, for example, I want to include in the package some additional
plugins and a customization.ini file of the GUI, I have to add in a
**addons** folder (line 186 of creatensis script). But how should I
specify files I put in here? Just create the folder *addons* in the
parent directory of creatensis and put them in?

- - finally, given that I'm doing some attempts, every time I run
creatensis (because something didn't worked), it re-downloads all the
files from the server. Is there an option that allows to not download
all the packages and using the downloaded ones in order to speed up
the entire process?


Thanks for the patience.

Cheers

Matteo

Hi,

having a python plugin which is supposed to check if there are labels I
use someting like this (python console):

iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer().hasLabelsEnabled()

(for an active simple point vector layer loaded)

But this always return False

is this method not working anymore because we switched label enginges?
Or is there something I do wrong?

See

Yes, exactly.
I think you should call something like :

settings = QgsPalLayerSettings()
settings.readFromLayer( layer )
if layer.enabled: ...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] operations in batch mode
Message-ID: <1397228243363-5134629.post@n6.nabble.com>

hello to all,
I have to make massive operations of "intersect" between postgis layers and
one simple area of extraction (shape file). 
I was thinking of using a module of Processing (in particular the "shapes
cut" saga module) in batch mode.
I immediately stopped because all operations can be performed only on data
sets that exist on the file system (shape, kml, etc.) so I can not use
postgis tables directly.

I should first convert the tables into shapes and then use the function
intersect in the batch but this should be done "manually", taking up a lot
of disk space, and in any case it would be an extra step. 

is there a reason why all operations in batch mode have to be performed only
with shape files et similia?

ciao

s.

I cannot think of any reason right now, so it looks like I designed it
like that and did not consider that alternative. My fault :-(

Could you add a ticket in the issue tracker, with this as a feature
request? I will try to work on that  I will crearly be a good
improvement

Thanks for the idea!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Compiling QGIS on Mavericks
Message-ID: <1397237981096-5134650.post@n6.nabble.com>

Well, after about a week of running battles and some great support from
Larry, I now have a successful dev environment.

I ended up with brew installation as per Larry's instructions:

brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
brew install qgis-22 --with-grass --with-globe

The first of these caused warnings and required me to install a few of the
dependencies explicitly - namely gdal, pdal and grass.

i.e brew install osgeo/osgeo4mac/gdal

The globe dependency failed to build but I may revisit this now I have a
working environment.

When I went to replicate the brew so I can work offline, I:

- took a patched version QGIS-Final-2_0_1
- wrote my own build script based on the brew generated parameters
- added the following env vars
export CXX=`which clang++`;
export CXXFLAGS="-F/usr/local/opt/qt/lib"

I can now compile and run the program, and of course start writing some c++
plugins (which was the original goal)

thanks again.

Andrew

Hi all: looks like feedback is positive overall.  Is there any
advisory on how to move this forward?

Thanks

Hi Andrew,

Just a quick note that if you have installed the qgis-22 formula, it
creates symlinks to your HOMEBREW_PREFIX. These are for the command line
launching utility and for the Python 'qgis' modules. If you also compile
your own build you will need to ensure the generated Python modules in
<build-dir>/output/python are parsed first, e.g. prepended to sys.path, or
you will not have the modules based off of your master, but the from the
stable version. You can also just do the following:

`brew unlink qgis-22`  <-- removes ~4 symlinks

This still leaves qgis-22 in a run-able state from:

HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/qgis-22/QGIS.app
- or -
HOMEBREW_PREFIX/opt/qgis-22/bin/qgis

In this manner, you can have several versions installed, e.g. 2.0, 2.2;
though, they share user config files - so don't run them all at once.  :-)

Regards

Larry

Larry

This is helpful.  But setting up the dev environment has raised more
questions than answers:

I needed to either download the patches to QGIS-2-0_1-final or suspend the
brew with --debug to create my own tree.

(having a brew -n to simulate the actions only would be nice; and a brew
--no_purge could be useful)

So my current dev tree is now not under version control - but I would at the
very least like to place the Plugin code under VC.  

The original plugin code I'm basing my work off is already accessible via
GitHub so do I make a new branch? And if so can I make this private until
I'm ready to share the work? Or can I simply setup a local Git repo and
merge this later as a new branch or the original as required? Welcome your
thoughts. 

(Sorry, I somewhat new to GitHub as well as homebrew  - btw I am using
qgis-20 - 22 was a typo.)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crash after using identify map tool
Message-ID: <534B743F.3060705@gmail.com>

Hi all,

It seems there's a crash when using the identify map tool.

1. Use identify to highlight a feature
2. Change the map tool
-> crash

The crash occurs in QgsMapToolIdentify::deleteRubberBands() at 
qDeleteAll( mRubberBands ); on line 666.

Anyone confirms?

J?rgen, it might be related to one of your commits: c91d470. Can you 
have a look?

Cheers,

Denis

Confirmed for me. 
I spotted it with "choose layer" option, clicking on the map, and then
clicking again on the map, outside the dropdown list box from previous
click.

I tried to create an **addons** folder in which I put some plugins
(same path of the installation, so finally it looks like
../ms-windows/addons/python/plugins).

Now, what if I want to include a GUI.ini customization file? Should I
put it in the addons folder `alone` or should I create a specific folder?

Eventually, is it possible to include also a --configpath option, so
that once the package is created and then installed, one can simply
open QGIS with a project and some data? (in a portable version the
- --configpath and the --customizationfile option have been included in
the QGIS.bat file, but I don't know where should I look for this file).

Thanks to all

Matteo

I think that, due to its structure, it is OK to add new chapter or
sections to the training manual. I particularly have plans to add a
few more exercises to the Processing part

Hello everybody,

SciPy (a very useful python library) is used by several plugin for QGIS,
and it is already included in osgeo4w @32 bit.
I would like to ask if it is possible to include SciPy in osgeo4w @64 bit
too.
I am also available for testing the package, if you need.

Thank you,

Probably better off asking elsewhere, this topic is specific to osgeo4w not
QGIS. There is a bugtraker and mailing list for osgeo4w.

In theory yes, in practice the list sees very little activity (mostrly
from qgis side anyway).
I think one important side of this is testing the existing packages to
see if they can be included as they are: am I wrong?
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Symbol levels
Message-ID: <534D2F1D.5020002@oslandia.com>

Hi,

There are some points I don't really understand with the current
implementation of symbol levels.

The UI asks for numeric levels, but, if I am correct, only relative
orders between two symbol layers are important.
Was there something else originally planned ? Something like a global
level to be able to order symbol layers of different vector layers ?

Another point : apart from performance issue, I cannot see any reason
why *not* to enable symbol levels. Are there situations were users do
want different symbol layers to overlap ?

Message-ID: <CAMB2qw32EhKAfGdFXDHx5ajoCQ16F6c-fead1m=_j=ys9qMn1A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, anyone having issues with this bug?

Simple test case: pick a vectorial point layer with the default style, see
the TOC legend;

open the style properties, go to Style and switch the units to "Map units".
As you can see, the symbol is very small. The situation is worse if you use
a SVG symbol, it's impossible to distinguish which is on the map and which
is on the legend.

I am going to ask also at the osgeo4w mailing list, but SciPy is missing
also from the QGIS installer @64 bit
(QGIS-OSGeo4W-2.2.0-1-Setup-x86_64.exe) therefore I think it is a QGIS
topic too.

Cheers,

Hi,

Confirmed. We would need a way to override the symbol map unit size with a
size mm - solely for the display of the legend.

No, it was meant just for levels within one layer.

I think there are such situations, from the top of my head:
- with symbol levels you cannot see the rendering progress (everything
is rendered at the end) - this makes quite a difference with big
layers
- you don't always want the symbol layers to be blended (different appearance)
- not all renderers need to support symbol levels

I don't think we should go with symbol levels always on.

This plugin is very useful to fine collimate Raster with vector layers.


Please,  test it and approvate it if you like.

Message-ID: <CACfnYnQpAKzACewubOD=WxrGv6q4qhkSFQ3phK8r=23Qku5rSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

sometimes it is necessary to create and publish with qgis server
multiple projects, that are made from the same template containing a
bunch of layers that are the same in all projects. IDs for this layers
are the same, then on qgis server issues happens

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7956
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10068

as suggested here

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7956#note-5

it seems that adding the project name to the actual layers id seems a
good and easy solution.

I was remembering that there was a patch/pull request about it, but
can't find it.

cheers!

Ok, so ... why the UI asks the user for integers ? And what is the
meaning of two layers with the same number ?
What about a UI with the list of symbol layers and some up/down buttons ?

If I am correct, you can still see the progress. You will see the first
symbol layer, then the second one, etc.

Now that Nyall gives an example of such rendering, that is clear.

Integers are there for convenience... with more complex scenarios
(e.g. roads with highway crossings) it may be handy to have numbers
instead of just a pure list, and to possibly have "holes" between the
levels.

> What about a UI with the list of symbol layers and some up/down buttons ?

That would be possible, but maybe harder to use. In the table view,
you can see symbols and their levels at once. In a simple list with
up/down buttons you need to split the symbols into symbol layers and
it is more difficult to identify what are the levels for one symbol
(IMHO).

Yes, but only once all features have been fetched from the provider -
and that interval usually dominates the rendering time. So, with a
layer that takes 5 seconds to render, there will be maybe 4 seconds
when you see nothing from the layer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing: default resolution
Message-ID: <534FB4BA.80501@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I noticed an inconsistency in how the default resolution is handled in
GRASS and SAGA backends:
* in SAGA, the default is 100, and is printed in each module; the user
is able to change it
* in GRASS, the default is apparently 1, but is not shown anywhere, nor
it can be changed; if the user leaves the default, many analyses run for
ages.
I would suggest to extend the behaviour of SAGA to GRASS also.
Opinions? Should I open a ticket?
All the best, and thanks.

Not sure this is a easy fix

In SAGA, some algorithms require that resolution, when a new raster
layers is created and there is not a raster input (interpolation,
rasterization...) In GRASS, that is a parameter of the region, which
complicates things.

If there are suggestions, I will be happy to change whatever is needed
in the GRASS provider

I think that 100 is a more sensible default for GRASS than the current one.
Best if you could print the default in the relevant case, instead of 0,
so the user can check and eventually change it.
Thanks.

	table
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash0F0QTBmYzWVP3jc_HP8o4AgrqEO3SL9doU0UjAwrVXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've just sent a pull request (#1323) which implements a caching
mechanism for the composer attribute table.

Currently, the composer attribute table is very heavy with the cpu, as
it refetches the attributes from the layer's provider with every
paint. This is both expensive and potentially results in many
duplicated calls to a database backend. This pull request implements
an attribute cache for the table so that the attributes are only
refetched when required (item properties change, vector layer emits
layerModified, or when exporting the composition). The end result is
that using composer tables no longer results in heavy cpu use and
continual provider queries.

I'm reluctant to merge this myself as I don't know the history behind
the composer table, and why it was originally created to requery on
every paint operation. Perhaps there's a valid reason for this which I
may be missing? Can anyone shed any light on this and let me know if
there's a use case I might be overlooking?

Hi Nyall,

I'm sorry I can't answer your question why no caching has been done 
before, I can just suspect that it was easier to implement and possibly 
to prevent memory abuse by heavy caching. From my limited point of view 
a +1 for caching.

I just wanted to ask if you considered to use QgsVectorLayerCache 
instead of implementing your own caching algorithm. I intentionally 
added this class to reduce the number of concurrent caching methods 
(there's another one for the vector joins and I think even others). I 
think it would be good to switch wherever possible to a single caching 
code, so we don't need to maintain several different ones and reinvent 
the wheel for e.g. limiting cached features and correct connection of 
all involved signals.

Best,
Matthias

Hi Nyall

It is a good idea to cache the provider results in the composer 
attribute table. Please apply the pull request.

There is no special reason for the current non-caching behaviour. It was 
fast enough for my usage when I implemented it back in 2010, so there 
was no reason for me to do caching.

Regards,
Marco

Message-ID: <535008A8.20909@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I noticed that apparently Processing, during the analyses starting from
layers in a CRS with +towgs parameters (e.g. 23030) creates outputs with
a similar projection, but without the parameters; a custom CRS is thus
created, and the output does not align with the input.
This happens at least with GRASS and R backends.
Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

I was using r.series directly in GRASS recently (both 6 and 7) and it
worked as expected. But perhaps you have some specific data.

Thanks Vaclav. I do not see anything special in my data (tried different
sets).
May I ask you a favour? Could you please try your data through
Processing, and report here?
I wish to debug this.

I have upgraded  the vector provider to GRASS 7, layers may be added
by drag from browser. The raster and the plugin are disabled. Be
careful about multiple versions on the same system
(LD_LIBRARY_PATH..., check with ldd if does not work).

Unfortunately GRASS 7 moved ahead towards its aim "to make life harder
for anyone trying to use the GRASS libraries" [1]. Basically more and
more low level functions are calling exit() instead of returning error
code if something failed. As I am not willing to implement GRASS
module call for each simple function, we have to think again about
hacks we can use:

1) add a requirement that GRASS 7 used with QGIS must be compiled with
-fexceptions

2) add a requirement that a patch (it is a single line comment in
fact) must be applied to GRASS 7 to make it usable with QGIS

3) use setjmp()/longjmp()

4) let QGIS crash whenever GRASS lib function fails

personally I am not fan of this approach. I still think that we should
provide in GRASS API function like G_set_fatal_error() with default
value G_FATAL_ERROR_EXIT (current behaviour). The second option would
be G_FATAL_ERROR_RETURN with big big warning in the API manual that
you are living GRASS libraries in completely unpredictable state and
you should immediately stop an application which is using GRASS
libraries. There no so big chance that someone will rewrite GRASS
libraries to be suitable for long running applications, on the other
hand we should allow in API possibility to avoid calling exit with big
warning to the programmer. Than it will be his/her responsibility if
he/she uses G_FATAL_ERROR_RETURN.

Thanks for this. If I understand well, this means:
* we can load GRASS7 vectors through QGIS browser
* we cannot load GRASS7 rasters
* the qgis-grass-plugin is not functional with GRASS7

BTW, GRASS6 vectors apparently cannot be loaded from QGIS browser as a
whole.

This, coupled with several serious regressions I found, may mean that
GRASS support in QGIS is essentially broken, and things may only get
worse with the arrival of GRASS7, if nobody works to fix it.
Am I too pessimistic?

this IMVHO does not seem feasible for all OS and distros.

same as above

this is obviously unacceptable.

The most likely solution seems to use GRASS only through Processing.
This also has a number of major limitations, however.

All the best.

Hi Radim,
IMHO we GRASS developers are  too stubborn to change the design of
GRASS GIS to work as library with persistent applications. This would
require rewriting plenty of core functionality and modification of all
C-modules. But there is a solution for persistent applications, called
Remote Procedure Call (RPC), more below.

I fear that none of these suggestions are good working solutions,
since in case a fatal error or a segfault occurs nothing (no
exception, no setjmp) will prevent QGIS from crashing. So i would like
to suggest the following:

5.) Using a RPC interface for map metadata, vector and raster map
access. Hence one or several GRASS "server" processes provide an RPC
interface to access GRASS library functions that are needed in a
persistent application. Most important is the vector editing, vector
reading/writing, database access, raster reading and map metadata
support. Everything else can be done using modules. Hence the RPC
interface will support only a limited subset of the GRASS library
functions. This RPC interface should only be used in the GRASS
provider classes, the GRASS plugin itself can be written in C++ or
Python.

This approach will decouple GRASS from QGIS, since all communication
is done via Inter Process Communication (IPC) using pipes or sockets.
There is no need anymore to catch a fatal error or to link GRASS
libraries directly to QGIS. The GRASS plugin can be implemented GRASS
version independently and so the GRASS data provider, since they will
not use GRASS functions directly only the RPC interface. The RPC
implementation on the side of GRASS will provide a consistent
interface that will not change in case the underlying GRASS API
changes.

I strongly suggest to use an existing RPC framework to implement fast
binary data exchange and the IPC. My favorite is apache thrift[1],
since it supports plenty of programming languages (C/C++, Python,
Java, JavaScript, ...) and provides operating system independent
client and server functionality. It supports exceptions on client side
that can be emitted in case a GRASS server process died because of a
fatal error, SIGINT or segfault.

I am absolutely willing to implement the RPC server side in GRASS
using thrift and C++, providing plenty of Python unit tests that show
howto use it on the client side. We just need to decide what kind of
GRASS library functionality is needed as RPC interface and what can be
done in QGIS with C++/Python directly (gisrc creation, GRASS
environmental variable settings, ...) or using GRASS modules
(g.region, g.gisenv, ...).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Hidden fields inserts null values rather than not
 inserting the field at all
Message-ID: <CAExk7p3kFQA0z3L-6YL2QSxsugq37XWf9w2L8okyggNubom8dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

When inserting features on a postgis table, it seems columns whose widget
is hidden are set to null, rather than not inserted at all.

If I hide (or set to readonly) the "id" column (a good idea anyways), it
make the following query on creating features:
INSERT INTO mytable("id","name","geometry") VALUES (null,'abc',geom)
But the user intends to do this query:
INSERT INTO mytable("name","geometry") VALUES ('abc',geom)

It seem QGIS is clever enough to fix the obvious problem for the primary
key of the tables (since one doesn't get not-null constrain violation upon
inserts), but is not clever enough to make it work on views (for whose you
get that non-null violation).

Postgres' views are editable by default when on single tables without
needing any rule/trigger, which is a very neat feature. But it's unusable
in QGIS for now because of this.

I think we should make it work as state above, maybe even removing the fix
for the primary id, but rather set the form to "readonly" by default for
autoincrementing primary fields.

What do you think ? Should I file a bug ? Am I missing something ?

Thanks and happy easters !

qgis.org/ubuntugis-nigthly and I installed grass package but Processing
report messing dependency. When I start grass from command line, it is in
`/tmp/processing/grassdata` location. I'm not sure if I ever actually used
Processing, so I can miss something essential. Do you have some pointers?

By the way, the error dialog main message is:

  Missing dependency.This algorithm cannot be run :-(

where a space after comma is missing. Also the dialog has a link to QGIS
doc for more details, but it is a general link to main page, it does not
tell much, I expected some configuration section.

You can try in directly in GRASS. I wanted to try with data available here
(NagsHead time series):

http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea582/common/GIS_anal_grass/GIS_Anal_grgeomorph2.html
http://courses.ncsu.edu/mea582/common/media/01/NagsHead_series.zip

Also, the version of GRASS installed from packages is 6.4.1 which is quite
old, so I tried that one and the result looks OK.

This is one of the problems of G_fatal_error(), it does not gives good
error messages to the user. User gets "G_malloc: unable to allocate %lu
bytes of memory at %s:%d" but does not have any idea when and why this
happened and what to do about it. If the module calling G_malloc() had the
chance to report error by itself, it could suggest to user to change some
parameter or use a smaller map. With G_fatal_error() user has only the
possibility to try to guess from debug messages, ask on mailing list or
keep trying with random changes in input parameters. I don't believe that
this is efficient.

G_fatal_error() is too low level not only for messages but in general, for
Python libraries wrapping GRASS library, it does not allow to throw an
exception in case of an error. And the same applies for C++ wrappers.

As far as I understand, the RPC wrapper suggested earlier by Soeren, would
hopefully allow to have exceptions (and no exit()) in Python and C++ and
thus potentially higher level error messages and also general error
handling would be possible (for those not using the original library).

The fact is that no library should use exit() or similar things if it wants
to be general. GRASS library is intended to be used only for building GRASS
modules, thus it is specialized for them, thus it uses G_fatal_error() with
exit(). (At least there is a believe that exit makes it easier.)

As a result using GRASS functions outside the scope of GRASS modules
requires another library. It would be nice to have two libraries, one for
GRASS modules (with exit()) and one for everybody else. Hopefully, it would
be possible to share the same code to some extent. Alternative is to use
the RPC wrapper as suggested earlier by Soeren, as far as I understand this
has the same result. The questions are what is less work, less duplication,
what has easier maintenance and what is easier to do for all the platforms.

I suspect the behaviour I'm seeing is a very platform/build dependant
quirk. At least, I can't reliably replicate it across different
platforms... Regardless, a cache should be a win for database users in
any case.

I'll check this out and update the code. Looks relatively

On Linux the grass path should be found automatically.

So, it is not found. Unsure how to fix it, try upgrading to the
experimental version of Processing.

At first shot, not a valid location (missing PERMANENT, probably more).
Will try to fix ASAP.

6.4.3 here, on Debian testing.

Hello devs!
even if on small things, I'm quite enjoying Python!
unfortunately still too many are the questions, even silly.

primary issue: where can I find some material dealing with Python functions?
I'm
 looking for info on:
- how to create a checkbox (code and functioning) the question dealing with the functioning: in which way it gives the 
result? (once checked, I need to add a particular string value to a 
command line)
- trigger event that makes appear sth when checked

secondary issues:
-
 where is possible to compile the Help label? I thought to copy-paste 
the most important things directly from the manual on a html or just put
 the link to the website with the pdf manual.
- the "open output 
after running algorithm" behaviour is set on ON as a default: is it 
possible to change (or delete) it in some way only for those tools 
producing a .csv? (otherwise QGIS gives an error in opening them)
- 
for some parameters would be nice to have the "[optional]" text or other
 text inside the box like for "[save to temporary file]" in output: is 
it possible to add it in a quick way or should be created a class like 
for Output?

btw, right now I added some more tools: when I'll 
finish everything shall I send a zipped folder to someone or upload the 
material somewhere?

are there news on lidar developments after the code sprint in wien?


sorry for the big disturb and thank you very much again!

have a nice day and enjoy holidays,


Niccol?

You chose very specific case of course. There is probably something
you don't want to understand. In the core libraries (gis, vector,
raster, imagery) there are 553(!) places where G_fatal_error() is
called. Some time ago you introduced G_fatal_error() even to the
function which tries to open raster map [1]. So if the raster map
doesn't exists the function is calling exit()! This is something which
makes life harder for anyone who want to use GRASS libraries (as you
already mentioned) with one exception - modules - standalone programs,
where you don't need to specify `if` statement. You can hardly explain
to someone that our libraries call fatal exit even when raster map is
not found. Yes, you can if don't want to change your opinion
regardless any input from outside world. For such cases, like opening
raster map would G_set_fatal_error() simply make sense.

I also don't think that would help much.  You would still need to use
G_set_error_routine to track that there was an fatal error and in turn avoid a
crash by not touching the result when the call returns - and keep away from
calling other library function because of the unpredictable state of the
library.

I guess there are also library calls inside the libraries themselves and those
would not be aware that there is a need to handle invalid results and might
crash before the toplevel caller has a chance know of the error.

I think that's Glynn's keypoint.

Using setjmp()/longjmp() or throwing C++ exceptions (with the libraries built
with -fexceptions) in the error routine would take you back to the caller that
is aware of the error.   That avoids the crash, but also leaves the library in
an unpredictable state.

To avoid that there's no other way than returning and handling all the errors
properly.  Probably huge amount of work with not much gain for GRASS.

The RPC approach will IMHO be less work and also cause less friction.

Niccolo

Since you are working with Processing, here are a few recommendations.

- You should not create your own GUI. Unless you really want a custom
iinterface (and that's going to take you tome and it is not so easy to
do it), you should just define the semantic of the algorithm and let
Processing create the interface. Otherwise, you will not be able to
integrate it easily in the modeler, toolbox etc.

-Parameters have default values. You can use them to set the initial

About that error when opening a csv file, can you provide more details
so I can try to fix it?

Hope this helps. Thanks!

As I wrote before, I hope that RPC approach suggested here by Soeren will
work for languages with exceptions and for persistent applications while
GRASS modules will benefit from the advantages of GRASS library with
G_fatal_error() with exit().

Exactly!

Hence the wrapper will not only do simple function wrapping, it will
also implement a higher level interface:

* map metadata read access as single client function will do on the
server side: open map; read metadata; close map; send data

* fast raster and vector map read access as single client function
will do on server side: open map; read requested map into memory based
on bounding box and render resolution; close map; send data

* vector editing: keep a single vector map in update state open in a
dedicated grass vector editing process. In case of a fatal error, this
map may be lost or corrupted. It is important that this process will
not be used for other purposes than single vector map editing.

* vector analysis functionality that need to keep vector maps open in
read only state for fast topological access. Information's about the
open vector maps (i. e. the position of the next line to be read) may
be lost in case the server process terminates.

* Same for raster map analysis


The client will detect if the server was terminated and will raise an
exception. In QGIS that will be the data provider classes.

The dedicated raster display module in QGIS is a nice starting point
to implement a
RPC function that will read a raster map as RGB color array based on
extent and resolution information into a byte array that
will be send via thrift (using thrift binary protocol) to the client.

The RPC interface should only support meaningful functions to be used
in a GUI, that's its only purpose.
It should not be used to implement processing algorithms or GRASS modules.
But it will in addition provide capabilities to use several processes
to read different chunks of the same map in the GUI,
hence parallel read only map access. This can be nicely done using a
pool of GRASS server processes.

There are plenty of functions using global variables in GRASS. Also,
persistent applications
may change the location and therefore the projection several times on
run-time. Are the GRASS libraries able to handle this correctly? The
suggested RPC server processes can be restarted in this case.

Best regards
Soeren

Message-ID: <CAFcNcQYAFPVk19fkeXQJ01m=bTkZ2gpK90f8X9pYZUakf2-bJw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list

hub.qgis.org seems to be broken for people who want to use it as a
repository for plugin's source code.

I'm having problems with it since almost a year:

http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/using-hub-qgis-org-git-repository-td5057063.html

and there are also several tickets related to it:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9741
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5969
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/4890

Currently there isn't even a way to manage SSH keys on the GUI, so it is
impossible to use it as a source code repository.

What is the word on this? Is hub.qgis.org no longer the preferred place to
store plugin's source code?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGis Server: can't display Oracle layers by WMS
Message-ID: <1398009411890-5136110.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi Everybody,

I'm struggling on Qgis server and Oracle Layers.

I have QGis x64 and QGis server x32 both ver 2.2 on the same machine
(Windows 7 x64) and I have a project with a shp layer and an Oracle layer:
it workss fine on QGis desktop.

I've configured project to expose layers to WMS.

The problem is on QGis Server where I can see and display shp layer but I
don't see any references to Oracle layer.

Are there anybody with experiences with QGis Server and Oracle? Or may be
QGis Server and MySQL?...
Any suggestions on how to solve?...

Best regards

Francesco

You are correct, SSH key management broke (the redmine plugin for it). I
asked the maintainer, and the short answer is it was intentionally
removed because it was causing problems. Unless someone else can figure
out what's wrong with it, or replace it with something that works it
will never be fixed. Current system is based on redmine_gitosis, which
is no longer maintained. An alternative is redmine_gitolite, but that
requires work to move repos from gitosis to gitolite (can all be done by
server admin). A slightly more complicated move would be to upgrade
Redmine or migrate to it's fork Chili-project in addition to switching
to gitolite. I went this way on my own server years ago when it was
clear that combo is more popular and maintained.

The plugin documentation has not been updated to reflect that this
prevents uploading of source to hub. So yes, the unofficial
recommendation is external hosting of code. Alternative hosting
suggested includes any of the free vcs hosting out there: bitbucket,
google code, github, sourceforge, etc...

The bigger question for the whole developer community, if we're not
hosting code on hub anymore should we transition to hosting tickets
somewhere/something else?

The original intent of hub, and reason Redmine was picked, was to be
able to put multiple project trackers all in one spot. This enables
users to not have to guess or track down where an issue tracker for a
plugin can be found. It also means the whole community can easily see
when a particular plugin author is being completely unresponsive, and
the community can turn it over to adoptive devs.

One option I've done a little research on would be to move tickets to a
django based issue tracker and integrate it directly with the plugins
pages. We clearly don't have a strong set of Ruby sys admins so anything
python related might be easier to maintain. There's even a fork of Trac
called Bloodhound, either of which now supposedly do multi-project.

Some will suggest we move everything to github. My personal opinion is
that the github issue tracker is still quite inadequate for the
complexity of QGIS and it would force users to a 3rd party service which
they may or may not want to use. I can elaborate on my dissent if this
option starts to gain traction.

Thanks,
Alex

so python binding is not compiled! why?

can someone confirm or it's a my problem? I've no changed my CMake config.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS processing tools for transit and traffic
Message-ID: <7D82A993-115F-4214-BC78-61E4AED4D20F@agam.org>

Hello to everyone.

I?ve created some processing scripts for transit and traffic analysis. They are available at this git repository : https://github.com/chourmo/QGIS-Transit-tools.git

This scripts are working on my data, but may need some testing. This is why I first announce them on this mailing list before doing it in the qgis user list.

It is possible :
- to make a network layer from a GTFS folder, add transfer points and connect to a road network at park-and-ride points
- find shortest times at all network nodes (transit or road) from a layer of start points and then make contour or buffers


I?ve tried to document as much and clearly as possible my scripts, and I?ve added some base data to test the scripts. Some more scripts will be added when I?ll find some time : draw shortest path (transit and road), road speed (curvature, slope, crossing, congestion), contour making, some graph statistics?

My goal is to have zero external dependency. I?ve extensively used qgis network analysis, which is quite fast to use but not that simple to use. I?ll make a separate mail to propose some change.


I hope those scripts will be useful to the qgis community.

Vincent,

They all look great! I was thinking about adding them as example scripts to
add to the current ones, but I think they are too complex to be used as
examples. However, we can maybe add them in a separate section of Transit
algorithms, so they are available for all Processing users. What do you
think?

I would be happy to have my scripts easily available to the community, but I wonder how would they be maintained or new scripts added ? Would I have to make pull requests on the main QGIS repository ? I guess I could keep my repository for sample data and some documentation.

2014-04-21 13:34 GMT+02:00 Vincent TINET <v.tinet at agam.org<mailto:v.tinet at agam.org>>:
Hello to everyone.

I?ve created some processing scripts for transit and traffic analysis. They are available at this git repository : https://github.com/chourmo/QGIS-Transit-tools.git

This scripts are working on my data, but may need some testing. This is why I first announce them on this mailing list before doing it in the qgis user list.

It is possible :
- to make a network layer from a GTFS folder, add transfer points and connect to a road network at park-and-ride points
- find shortest times at all network nodes (transit or road) from a layer of start points and then make contour or buffers


I?ve tried to document as much and clearly as possible my scripts, and I?ve added some base data to test the scripts. Some more scripts will be added when I?ll find some time : draw shortest path (transit and road), road speed (curvature, slope, crossing, congestion), contour making, some graph statistics?

My goal is to have zero external dependency. I?ve extensively used qgis network analysis, which is quite fast to use but not that simple to use. I?ll make a separate mail to propose some change.


I hope those scripts will be useful to the qgis community.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Building QGIS with Visual Studio Express 12
Message-ID: <5356379A.4020000@robinschwab.ch>

Hi everyone
I am a curious user so I tried to build QGIS myself using Visual Studio 
Express 2013 on Windows 8.1

This how-to [1] is well written but outdated. I fail when running 
cmake-gui trying to build a project. I get the following CMakeError.log:

It seems almost all the paths have changed since 2003. How do I assign 
the paths so all the libraries are found? How do you build the official 
binaries?

I tried adjusting the lib variable or renaming it to libpath or 
assigning CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH in cmake-gui or using nightly cmake 3.0 but 
nothing helped.

Sincerly

Robin

Hi,

I spent some time on Friday trying to upload qgis-epanet in the plugin 
repository.

The doc 
(http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/releasing.html#official-pyqgis-repository-validation) 
says that

    'the name of the main folder containing your plugin must contain
    only contains ASCII characters (A-Z and a-z), digits and the
    characters underscore (_) *and minus (-)*, also it cannot start with
    a digit'

And it was also reminded to me when the Upload of the plugin failed 
(plugin is broken)

I ended up creating a local plugin repo for testing the two (attached) 
minimal plugins.

When installing the plugin with a minus '-' in the directory name, there 
is a problem (python/pyplugin_installer/installer_data.py:620) on:

    exec "import %s" % key in globals(), locals()

Plugin manager simply reports 'python said: invalid syntax' which is not 
very helpful.

Note that the error only occurs when installing the plugin from 
PluginManager, if you unzip under $HOME/.qgis2/python/plugins, and open 
qgis, both plugins load without error.

Am I missing something obvious ?

Using mswindows/osgeo4w/package.cmd and/or package-nightly.cmd, but with Visual

used to built Qt in OSGeo4W.

Hi !

Still about this : do you plan to continue maintaining packages for
qgis-mapserver for RHEL ?
If so, do you have an ETA for 2.2 (or 2.4) ?
If not, I guess I'll either have to switch distro or learn how to compile
the mapserver...

Thanks !

Olivier

Message-ID: <535669C1.1030801@standortsanalyse.net>

Hello!

Both rjhale at northrivergeographic.com an myself [1,2] have already posted 
to the QGIS User list about problems with QGIS 2.2 following an update 
to (K)Ubuntu 14.04 because of a missing or wrong dependency concerning 
the Python SIP-API: Kubuntu 14.04 has sip-api-11.0, but 
python-qgis-common and python-qgis depend on sip-api-10.1, which is not 
available on (K)Ubuntu 14.04.

What can be done about this problem? Is it a "simple" packaging problem 
or are more changes necessary? Unfortunately, my knowledge of python is 
practically not existent...

Sorry for cross-posting it now here to the developer list, but maybe 
this is the better place than the user's list!

Thank you very much for your efforts,
kind regards from Austria,
Albin

Yes. We are talking about current master, not about intended final
implementation.

You are talking about GRASS 6 support? What are serious regressions?

The Processing plugin may substitute "GRASS Tools" part of the plugin
(i.e. modules GUI), it cannot help  with:
  - mapset creation
  - vector/raster maps visualization
  - vector digitizing
  - region visualization and editing
The Processing plugin is good for users who don't want to use GRASS
data format at all. The GRASS plugin is GRASS GUI alternative for true
GRASS users.

It sounds interesting but it seems to be a huge work an far future. I
am also concerned about complexity, e.g. starting / keeping running
servers on various platforms. I can imagine endless bug reports about
"server not running". I am looking for something which will not
require permanent assistance. It is not KISS enough for me.

I mean to allow to throw exception from the function set by
G_set_error_routine().

Good.

Do you mean to add some Rast_clean() to GRASS lib and call it from
G_fatal_error()? Something to be done in GRASS library?

Still, any dynamically allocated memory, to which there is no pointer
from static structures like R__, will never be released.

Its far less work then modifying GRASS libraries to run with
persistent applications. We need
such an approach anyway, since vector editing is a GUI task -> GUI is
a persistent
application -> we need an exit safe interface to the GRASS libraries
to implement a reliable
vector editing GUI in GRASS itself.

Since only QGIS is spawning the "server" process, it is always able to
check if the
process is running and can restart it when needed. We already make use
of this concept in GRASS
and it works nicely[1]. Spawning of processes and keeping track of
them is an easy task with Qt,
and it is completely OS independent. The Qt Bitcoin client for example
makes use of RPC
and runs on Windows, Mac OS and various Linux systems. So i don't see
a problem here.

> require permanent assistance. It is not KISS enough for me.

What would be a better KISS solution?

IMO the RPC approach will make the implementation of the QGIS-GRASS
data provider and the
plugin simpler. There will be no mixing of C++ and C-code anymore. No
setjmp/longjmp/exception
workaround that is really complex and will not prevent QGIS from
terminating or segfaulting eventually in case of a fatal error.
The QGIS GRASS data provider/plugin will be a clean C++ implementation
using the thrift library.
It will be better maintainable since developers do not need to know
all the different
GRASS libraries (gis, raster, vector, database) but only the RPC
interface that make
use of a subset of the GRASS library functions, bundling them in an
object oriented API.
QGIS do not need to link against GRASS libraries anymore, future GRASS
versions will be supported out of the box.

This is much more KISS then the current approach.

Best regards
Soeren

Hi DevList,
I've moved this over from 'user' to 'dev'.

Is there an upcoming fix to get python-qgis working with the 
sip-api-11.0 that comes with Ubuntu 14.04 64 bit?

Thanks,
Zoltan

The note about the stable debian packages for not yet release distributions
also applies to ubuntu.  The packages were made before trusty was released and
trusty meanwhile changed[1].

The packages just needed a rebuild.   Try again now.

the issue of longer term maintenace is a serious one, however.
It woulbe be good if you could add a few test, so we could easily check
when maintenance is needed.
All the best, and thanks.

IMHO we should suggest plugin dev a reasonable, simple and effective
default way of sharing code and tickets. Of course, if one cooses a
different strategy, no problem for us.
If we can fix the redmine issue, all the better (having the tickets in
the same location would be good), otherwise the most likely candidate
currently seems GH.
Could we reach an agreement on this?
I'm willing to fix the howto page once we decided.
Thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] python: QgsProject.instance() sometimes failing
Message-ID: <5356D0EC.10808@duif.net>


Hi, trying to test/upgrade the the Live Stats plugin, we encounter the
following error sometimes (it is hard to find out when exaclty):

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/richard/.qgis2/python/plugins/liveStats/LSmain.py", line
154, in saveToFile

QgsProject.instance().writeEntry('LiveStats','SavedStats',saveStringsLists)
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'instance'

So it seems that QgsProject evaluates to NoneType ???

Not sure when it exactly it happens, but obviously this should never be
the case is it?

Anybody an idea?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

I plan to create new packages for RHEL 7, where the dependencies should 
be up to date for current QGIS versions.
I could create packages for older RHEL versions, but that would require 
somebody to fund the time necessary to adjust the QGIS code for the 
older dependencies.

Best
Matthias

Maybe that another option would be to have a way to easily (no programming, just some configuration) Processing providers from the existing plugin infrastructure. Would it be possible to create a generic ? Processing Git Provider? qgis plugin that would fetch and install some scripts from a git repository ? It will be useful to other ? scriptwriters ?.

To Paolo, how do I write tests for a processing script and how would they be tested ?

Vincent,

They all look great! I was thinking about adding them as example scripts to add to the current ones, but I think they are too complex to be used as examples. However, we can maybe add them in a separate section of Transit algorithms, so they are available for all Processing users. What do you think?

2014-04-21 13:34 GMT+02:00 Vincent TINET <v.tinet at agam.org<mailto:v.tinet at agam.org>>:
Hello to everyone.

I?ve created some processing scripts for transit and traffic analysis. They are available at this git repository : https://github.com/chourmo/QGIS-Transit-tools.git

This scripts are working on my data, but may need some testing. This is why I first announce them on this mailing list before doing it in the qgis user list.

It is possible :
- to make a network layer from a GTFS folder, add transfer points and connect to a road network at park-and-ride points
- find shortest times at all network nodes (transit or road) from a layer of start points and then make contour or buffers


I?ve tried to document as much and clearly as possible my scripts, and I?ve added some base data to test the scripts. Some more scripts will be added when I?ll find some time : draw shortest path (transit and road), road speed (curvature, slope, crossing, congestion), contour making, some graph statistics?

My goal is to have zero external dependency. I?ve extensively used qgis network analysis, which is quite fast to use but not that simple to use. I?ll make a separate mail to propose some change.


I hope those scripts will be useful to the qgis community.

* creating a new location is partly broken (cannot take the extent from
the canvas, at least for some projections); a minor issue, but a serious
concern for new users
* the region resolution cannot be changed interactively.

Yes, got it. The question is: what is the real advantage to use grass
alone, instead of jointly with other tols in Processing?
I see two major ones:
* Processing is blocking the main QGIS canvas, which for very long
analyses is unacceptable
* import-export overhead is a serious issue for complex vectors.

All the best.

That should be a matter of putting Processing algorithm in a different
thread. We had it like that, but it proved to be rather unstable, so it was
termporarily disabled, but i hope i can do further work on that and rework
that part

Hi,

I've added a wiki page to discuss the design of this feature here :
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/virtual_layers

It's mainly focused on Regis' use case (create a spatial view out of X,Y
coordinates).

Feel free to comment/complete.

We have already the providers and the plugin working with GRASS 6, I
just want to upgrade it to GRASS 7. The only problem I found so far is
that G__get_window() and Rast_get_cellhd() call G_fatal_error(). I can
only dedicate few hours/max days of my free time to that, so I have to
consider well what is less work, RPC is not.

Vector lib does not call G_fatal_error(), it was written in parallel
with QGIS plugin with vector editing in mind. I hope it is still true.

The raster provider is already using something like that. Raster data
are read from executed GRASS module output (a module written for that
in QGIS in fact) and identify tool keeps another GRASS module running
and it is communicating with that through a  pipe. I wrote that as an
experiment and because I know, how much unnecessary additional code
and potential problems it is, I don't want to continue in that
direction.

We are no starting the plugin from scratch, it is already written, we
just need to make it work with GRASS 7.

Hi,

It seems that the Georeferencer (core plugin) in Raster menu in QGIS
2.3 master / nightly build in Windows (OSGeo4W64 setup installer) is
missing in action.

Any reason why it is missing or omitted in Raster menu?

Thanks,

I am not even trying to ask that question. As long as there are GRASS
users using the QGIS plugin, it should not be thrown away.

There is the GRASS Direct lib which allows GRASS raster modules to
read/write data through QGIS providers. I is currently disabled, needs
some fixes but it was mostly working. If fixed, it can be easily used
in Processing, I think.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Multithread rendering with GRASS vectors crash
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYppKw-qcBeTy9u9_yMOV_aBhpLLaN+_GOtwCw6UxqMmRA@mail.gmail.com>

Multithread rendering crashes if multiple GRASS vector layers from the
same map are rendered simultaneously. It is mentioned in #9980.

That happens because to save resources, the GRASS vector provider
keeps only single instance of each opened vector map in static
QgsGrassProvider::mMaps. I am not sure if the crash comes from GRASS
lib or from the provider. Parallel rendering of layers from different
maps works OK. It means that only one layer from a map may be rendered
at time but parallel rendering of multiple layers from different maps
is desired.

What can be done Martin? Some conditional mutex? Can you fix that?

I fear that might be not the case anymore. For example, all memory
allocation functions G_calloc(), G_malloc() and G_realloc() will call
G_fatal_error() in case the memory allocation fails. As far as i can
tell the vector library make often use of this functions. So we have
the problem that basic core functions call G_fatal_error() that are
used all over the place in GRASS GIS.

If you patch GRASS to use setjmp/longjmp to implement an exception
like behavior then you need to write clean up code for static
variables and dynamically allocated memory. A G_fatal_error() call can
be deeply nested in a library function. Cleaning only the static
variables to be in usable state will lead to problematic memory leaks.
So it is a complex task in GRASS.

Using setjmp/longjmp in QGIS wrapping all GRASS functions that might
call G_fatal_error() is complex, since a G_fatal_error() call can be
deeply nested in a library function. You need to keep track of this
resulting in plenty setjmp wrappers around GRASS functions.
You need to cleanup global static structures as well and you will have
no control over pointers pointing to dynamic allocated memory that got
lost in a longjmp.

IMHO booth cases require plenty of work to make them usable.

Having a kind of garbage collector in GRASS, implemented in the
G_*alloc() functions, may solve many problems. But i have no idea
howto implement the garbage collector to detect pointers that got
orphaned in a longjmp to automagically clean them.

The next step would be to centralize global variables to clean them up
more easily (as Glynn mentioned).

Because of the undefined state of global variables and structures and
because of potential memory leaks that may sum up making QGIS
unusable.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rendering a map in QgsComposition on Win 7 / 8
Message-ID: <5357FEF9.5070100@o2.pl>

Hello,

I'm writing a plugin for QGIS 2.2.0 which should render a pdf file with 
a map and some text.

I don't know if it's relevant, but I want to render only raster layers.

I got it working under Linux (current Arch) and Windows XP, but it's not 
working on Windows 7 or 8.

The plugin is to be runned from QGIS, so it has access to self.iface 
variable.

I've used code samples from tutorial.

Here is the code I use:

mapRenderer = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
mapRenderer.setLayerSet(input_map_layers) #list of map layers id's
mapRenderer.setOutputUnits(QgsMapRenderer.Millimeters)
mapRenderer.setOutputSize(QSize(map_width_on_print_mm, 
map_height_on_print_mm), 300)
mapRenderer.setExtent(rect)

c = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
c.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)
c.setPaperSize(210,297)

composerMap = QgsComposerMap(c, 
14.7026,113.85,map_width_on_print_mm,map_height_on_print_mm)
composerMap.setFrameEnabled(True)
composerMap.setFrameOutlineWidth(0.5)
c.addItem(composerMap)

printer = QPrinter()
printer.setOutputFormat(QPrinter.PdfFormat)
printer.setOutputFileName(unicode(input_data_fields['output_pdf_filename']))
printer.setPaperSize(QSizeF(c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()), 
QPrinter.Millimeter)
printer.setFullPage(True)
printer.setColorMode(QPrinter.Color)
printer.setResolution(c.printResolution())

pdfPainter = QPainter(printer)
paperRectMM = printer.pageRect(QPrinter.Millimeter)
paperRectPixel = printer.pageRect(QPrinter.DevicePixel)
c.render(pdfPainter, paperRectPixel, paperRectMM)
pdfPainter.end()


Can anyone help me with making it work under Win 7 / 8? What am I missing?

Message-ID: <1398291254782-5136806.post@n6.nabble.com>

Do you think it would be a nice thing to have a dedicated icon to add North
Arrows? I know you can just add an image and choose one of the very few
North Arrows, but in canvas the option is explicit. It took me about an hour
around composer until I google it to realize I can add an image.

I think a dedicated icon/menu item would work best as it will provide only
the relevant North Arrows like in canvas.

I don't care about allocation error. If it really runs out of memory
then exit() is maybe the best. Any other action (saving project,
saving changes) will also need memory and thus fail. Are you often
running out of memory?

It made me curious how Qt handles allocation problem, because I think
that allocation results are not checked in the whole QGIS at all. For
example QString::realloc(int) on the pointer returned by malloc()
calls Q_CHECK_PTR() macro which prints error if pointer is 0. Then it
continues execution even if allocation failed.

I don't want to patch GRASS until it is really inevitable. The next

setjmp will be called just before the top level function we need.

In theory maybe, in practice it will work and it DOES work with GRASS
6. I don't care about few bytes lost. G_fatal_error() is really rare
in QGIS provider/plugin, it should be rare.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Qt] promoting root object
Message-ID: <5359F96D.8050603@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a small question regarding promoting widgets.
I created a custom UI class based on a QGroupBox.
It seems I can't promote my custom group box to be a QgsCollapsibleGroupBox.

Is this not possible for root element?

Cheers,

Denis

Well, I can't provide screenshots, so I'll try to detail what I did:

With QGIS source, in Qt Creator:

* File->New->Qt Designer Form Class

* I chose the template to be a QGroupBox.

* Hence, I got my header/source/desgin files.

* I entered the design mode for my ui file

* Right click on the root object (MyGroupBox) -> promoted widgets

* QgsCollapsibleGroupBox is already loaded but I can't promote

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QWC: python script for language extractions
Message-ID: <535A1322.2080102@carto.net>

Hi all,

QGIS web client now has 12 languages. This is positive. But the negative
side effect is that the translation file is now over 100k - too big if
you are only interested in one or two languages.

We are looking for a small python utility that allows the extraction of
the given language codes - e.g. a user only wants languages "en", "fr"
and "de".

I am talking about this file here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Web-Client/blob/master/site/js/Translations.js

If there is any volunteer who wants to tackle this, or if someone has
already done this, please let us know.

Along the lines we are looking for a way to better deploy QWC, e.g. by
concatenating JS and CSS files into single files and minifying
everything. If someone has experience and could contribute, please let
us know as well.

Thanks,
Andreas

agreed fully, of course. The issue is: how much work is required for
this? and: who is goig to invest on it?

I think rasters are not a big issue (AFAIK they are read through
v.external, so no import); vectors seem more diffucult to handle though.

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Modes of Identify Tools removed?
Message-ID: <535A5BAE.9050106@carto.net>

Hi,

I noticed that the different modes of the Identify tool were removed, at
least from the settings.

Was there consensus on this?

Some colleagues of mine prefer other modes than the layer choice, e.g.
the Drill down, stop at first.

Also the other options (like dock window and feature form if single
feature is identified) were removed - and I think they were quite useful
to have.

I think it makes sense to keep these options.

Hi,

Ah - I see that the options were moved to the identify panel/dialogue.

I guess that is fine and it makes the different modes changeable without
having to open the options dialogue.

Sorry for the noise. Now that I get it I think it is an improvement.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hey Andreas,

Yes I removed these because there were inconstant in there usage and caused
a lot of confusion.  The options have all been moved to the identify dock
and can be change while using the tool.  The auto open form checkbox has
also been moved there.  Because auto opening the attribute form is not
always something that you want to do it doesn't make sense to make it a
option in the Options dialog.

The identify dock is now also always opened and contains the results even
if there is only one.  This is to make the experience with the tool more
constant.  The previous method of sometime opening the dock, sometimes the
attribute table, sometimes having features, other times not, is way too
confusing.

The identify dock is now a forced dock because it also doesn't make sense
to have it a dialog window. If you need it floating you can tear it off
like the legend.  The best method for the dock is now to dock behind or
under one of the other docks, I normally go below the legend.

Hi,

Thanks for the clarification. Makes sense. We will need to cover this in

documentation already opened?

Not currently no.

Yes it will be a update issue with things like this but I think it's worth
the little bit of pain.

I'm hoping to have the docs stuff building at some stage so I can help
update stuff that I break.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MapCanvasItem scaling
Message-ID: <CAEHjKAvpEM620_UVS4MvU0FcHxe_nuzNEv9UWmeJdhPTaYzcNQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm gathering some ideas to make a plugin (related to fishing gears and
positioning) which would show the position of a vessel and a towed gear.
I'm trying to make a, say so, pointer (like th eone in GPS plugin) or
marker for the ship and its gear.

Currently I've tested QgsMapCanvasItem and it is OK (I'm able to draw the
ship, rotate it depending on the bearing or update positions, for
instance), but I'm stuck with a simple thing: I can't figure out how to
plot it with the correct size depending on the map scale. I will know,
among other measures, the ship length and width in meters (or whatever real
world unit is used... feet, yards)

Of course, providing that the overall size of ship+gear can be in the range
of 1000 to 2000 meters, there is certain scales in with it's not worth to
draw, and it shouldn't be too complicated to implement a "scale switch".

Does anyone know articles/resources about how to cope with this?

Thank you very much for your time, have a nice weekend

Message-ID: <1398454699.73421.YahooMailNeo@web122305.mail.ne1.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I've compiled and installed yesterday QGIS 2.3 master, on Xubuntu 12.04, but it is continually crashing with a segmentation fault (core dumped). I just load a layer (raster / shape / postgis) and do some zoom in / zoom out. I've tried with the option to render with all processor cores active / deactivated, but it happens exactly the same. I've also uninstalled the CADInput plugin, because I read somewhere that it could give problems, but not resolved.


On the console::

The faster I zoom in / zoom out, more "breaking!" appears, until the Segmentation fault... See here:

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/crash_nightly.ogv 


In the first attempt I was using the ubuntugis-stable repository, with gdal 1.9.x. However, I updated all packages with ubuntugis-unstable, and went back to compile, but the same thing happens.

In a last attempt, I tried the nightly builds, also without success.

I've uninstalled everything that was associated with qgis, grass, gdal; erased folders .qgis2 and .config/QGIS, but still crashes...

Error reports always refer to something related to QgsMapRenderer: SIGSEGV in QgsMapRenderer::extent() / QgsMapRenderer::updateScale() / QgsMapRenderer::adjustExtentToSize():

This alleviates some of my concern, as there is a viable exit strategy now.
http://codetheory.in/export-your-issues-and-wikis-from-github-repo-and-import-to-bitbucket-migration/

It would be really cool if we could wrap the api's into our own search
tool, then we could auto search plugin repos hosted on bitbucket or
github from the plugins.qgis site.

Even encouraging all uses onto github doesn't solve how to search the
main QGIS and Plugins tickets together at the same time.

We need a good discussion of the topic here since it affects more than
just devs. I'm not sure how to come to a definitive decision.

FYI, bitbucket support OpenID, github does not. OpenID might be a way
for us to make things easier for new users. I can see implementing
Django OpenID for plugins.qgis.


To throw in a twist, we could run these:

I just recompiled QGIS 2.2 and everything works fine. So, the problem is only with the master.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Processing and GRASS 7
Message-ID: <CALuHMPC3JA_1LRWc8QqB3DKa6c8EQRmyNK9m-aRhxBkYy9kw7g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I tried to get Processing GRASS 7 provider to work on Windows 7 64-bit.
As OSGeo4W installer does not offer GRASS 7 package for now, I download
standalone installer from grass.osgeo.org (WinGRASS-7.0.0beta2-1-Setup.exe)
and install it to C:\GRASS7. After this I can run GRASS GUI and command line.

In Processing options I set GRASS Folder to c:\GRASS7 and GRASS msys folder
to C:\GRASS7\msys. But when I tried to run any GRASS algorithm via Processing
I get error saying that GRASS folder is not set.

After some investigations I found two issues:
1. there is no getGrass7Version method in Grass7Utils module
2. provider name is "grass70" but for test used name "grass7"

Fixing this issues doesn't help, I still can't run GRASS 7 algorithms
via Processing.
So I tried to run grass7_script.bat from OSGeo shell and found that it can't be
executed because of missed dlls. Seems this is the root of problem.

This dll present in GRASS install folder, but QGIS runs GRASS algorithms using
OSGeo shell.

Any ideas how to setup environment to use both GRASS providers: GRASS 6.x
from OSGeo and GRASS 7 installed from standalone installer?

Thanks

Message-ID: <op.xexceeg0na7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

I'm wondering if there is an advantage in using pyuic to manually compile  
.ui files instead of just using uic.loadUi() in the plugin directly, e.g.

 from PyQt4 import uic
self.dock = uic.loadUi( os.path.join( path, "dockwidget2.ui" ) )

Thanks for any insights!

Best wishes,
Anita

Hey Anita,

For a qgis plugin. None, or so little that it doesn't matter.

There is a small overhead that you have to load it from file each time but
its really nothing.

There is also a LoadUiType which only loads once.

Both are fine.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend context menu
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFdXFRONorDfQv8=QAMDmOasYcW2c-__YcnOLi7pJ2Vwcg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

While doing some work on legend refactoring, I have realized how messy
the context menu in legend widget got. Some of the findings:
- there can be way too many actions... 23 items for a layer if you are
lucky. Usually less, it depends on various conditions
- some actions act upon the current layer (even if more layers are
selected), some actions act upon all selected layers and some actions
are even acting globally. A bit strange for a _context_ menu... vector
layers get one more separator in the menu than raster layers
- the shortcuts (the letter with underscore) are often used for more actions
- sometimes the actions that are not available are disabled, sometimes hidden
- the ordering of actions could be better

It would be good to do some consolidation - remove rarely used
actions, think about grouping of the items etc. I am afraid that with
time the things will get only worse if we freely keep adding more
features to the menu... (how long is your plugin menu? :-)

If you are interested in more details, I have tried to summarize the
actions in a spreadsheet here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f8t3e11Cb999zQMuRJ32Y-yHmNvvKC5w_lq-cm2GbrM/edit?usp=sharing

Your input is most welcome!

Cheers
Martin

I agree, having shortcuts is good having to many is not always good. Some
actions could be removed if they are present somewhere else.

Now the difficult part is what to keep

For example for me set Project CRS from layer should be removed from there
and add the option to use a layer in the appropriate menu but someone else
might disagree

Actually it was a broader problem with any GRASS maps, I have found
out that GRASS library is not reentrant and simply cannot be used from
multiple threads.

Yes, a mutex should work - should be fixed in 40b20f. As a result, all
access to GRASS from iterators is serialized.

BTW, it would be very useful to add to the Django appa field for editor

Message-ID: <535E3DBF.10307@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently, plugins are tagged in a rather inefficient way. The list of
tags as displayed in the webapp (unsure whether tags used <3 times are
included) is:

analysis cad cadastre calculator centroid composer database dem
digitizing ecology export feature field geometry google html import
inspire labeling land cover legend line load map metadata network
analysis openlayers openstreetmap osm point polygon polyline postgis
processing profile project python raster remote sensing routing sample
search selection service shape shapefile spatialite statistics style
time transparency vector web wkt wms

Some of them are very little informative, and some plugin miss what is
apparently their most appropriate tag.
I would suggest all authors to rethink their tagging strategy, and
converge on the most useful ones.
Maybe someone could suggest a list of preferred tags?

All the best.

Hi Anita, 
I wasn't aware of that possibility. 
That would be great to document that in pyQgis Cookbook and to upgrade
plugin builder. That compile part is over complicated for new users and
probably we loose some potential contributors..

I would suggest we look for a way to allow the community to refine the
tags on a given plugin. Upvote good tags, suggest new tags.

Haven't checked but does the tagging system match as you type?

Definite +1 from me to upgrade plugin builder to this version of UI  
loading.

I wonder if there is also a way to load resources (such as icons) without  
having to compile them first.
Only then would we get rid of all the console compile stuff.

Resources can also be loaded directly from files, they do not have to
be compiled with pyrcc4. Simply use the real path instead of the
"internal" path (starting with colon).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] labeling API changes from 2.2 to 2.3
Message-ID: <535F2508.8030304@mail.geometrics.com>

Hi,

A while ago I developed Lat/Lon labeling plugin for QGIS, it worked fine 
including versions 2.2.x
However in 2.3.x I noted that label text is missing. I wonder if any of 
labeling APIs were dropped.
I have used "old style" labels similar to 1.x QGIS.

But there is no waining messages when my plugin runs either.

Is there serious changes in labeling from 2.2.x to 2.3.x which are not 
backward compatible?

thank you
Mikhail

Hi Larissa,

I've got a work in progress update to the composer docs which bring
them up to date for 2.2. Is this overlapping with your work? I'd
estimate I've rewritten about ~50% of the current print composer
chapter but was going to finish before sending through a documentation
pull request.

Also, I added the cut/copy/paste items to the composer menu, is there
anything specific I can help you out with regarding these?

Hi all.
I am adding my notes on the plugins to be approved directly on the
django interface, using the About field. I encourage others to do the
same. Comments have to be removed before publication.
It would be useful to have a list of items to be checked for approval.
Here a few items:
* no .pyc files (correct?)
* virus scan (how to do it? could this be automatic on the server side?)
* if special data are needed to test the functioning, a small sample
should be added
* the plugin should go to the appropriate menu (Vector, Raster, Web,
Database).
I'm also checking for:
* the presence of bugtracker and code repo
* correctness of links
* installation and basic functioning.
Anyone wants to add?
The good news is that we now have only 9 unapproved plugins:
* 5 are being worked on
* for 2, authors are not responding
* 1 has issues with licence
* 1 is considered unsuitable by the author.
All the best.

Hello,

As you already said, it would be great if such a reviewer comment feature 
would be available directly in the django interface.

> It would be useful to have a list of items to be checked for approval.

Some more items for code reviewing :
* english language used in code (comments, identifiers)
* good shape of source repository :
- no generated file in repository (ui_*.py, resources_rc.py, gen. help files?)
- good code organization (subfolders)
- code comments
- PEP8 & Python/QGIS guidelines compliance
- a README file
- a LICENCE file (GPL2/GPL2+ mandatory)
* Licence compliancy wrt external dependencies (e.g. no import of commercial 
python module)
* "No evil" : track the obvious "rm -Rf ~/" code

As for external dependencies, I think it should be clearly stated somewhere if 
the plugin has a need for non-free external dependency.
If some dependencies are not available in OSGeo4w Python, a clear indication 
of how to install them should be given.

Great review work from your part Paolo btw !
We will try to join the effort soon.

Vincent
