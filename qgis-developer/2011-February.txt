Subject: [Qgis-developer] wps bakeoff? anyone interested
Message-ID: <0B1D3A19-BB15-45CD-A66E-9AEBC68AF966@gmail.com>

After foss4g last year there was the idea of doing a bit of a wps bake off or something :-)

I am checking in with the various development teams to see if anyone is interested.

While the various server teams are interested in getting to benchmarks (in classic shootout style) - I am more interested in keeping them honest and checking the interpretability side of things.  To be honest seeing another handcrafted xml request sent to a wps leaves me a bit cold. I would like to make sure the various describe process information is being handled correctly to the point where wps clients can manage to make a request safely.

I understand qgis has a shiney wps plugin; so is the development team interested in taking part?

This week I am just making contact and collecting interested parties. 

If you are interested in taking part; please consider a couple of points.
a) what are you expecting out of the process?
b) please check that you have enough time as a team take part

Cheers,
Jody

Hi Jody,
Horst D?ster is the author of the QGIS WPS plugin, but because i have
updated the plugin recently with new shiny features i would like to
join the discussion too. And because i am the author of the
wps-grass-bridge which is in use by ZOO WPS, PyWPS and 52N WPS i can
offer some expertise in GRASS GIS 7 as WPS backend for benchmarks.

Best regards
Soeren

btw.:
Here you can see the capabilities of the QGIS WPS plugin, PyWPS,
wps-grass-bridge and GRASS GIS 7:

Nice a pleasure to meet you; sounds like you are rocking wps party.

Things are still taking shape for a "wps bakeoff".  I want to give each team a chance to think about if they want to take part or not. I expect some may need to wait for their normal IRC meeting etc.

So yeah; have a think; and we can chat about scope and schedule next week.

Jody

Hi

The featureCount() method of QgsVectorLayer is returning the number of all the features in the layer without considering the sql subset. Is this on purpose?

 Hi,

 In the new symbology it is not possible to specify the stroke-width of 
 simple markers. This was possible in the old symbology.

 I created a ticket at http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3458

 It would be cool if this could be fixed before the switch to the new 
 symbology.

 Thanks and best regards,

Hi Sven

The qgis libraries (libqgis_core, libqgis_gui, libqgis_analysis) are GPL ( not 
LGPL! )

> As i consider to integrate the Libraries in our product, i wonder if I then

You are not obliged to publish it (e.g. using it internally inside a company 
is not considered as publishing). In that case you don't have to give away the 
source (see http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-
faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic)

But if you publish it (e.g. give it to another company, sell binaries, etc.), 
you need to provide the source.

Regards,
Marco

Hi Nathan,

the raster update works fine.

Today I noticed that if the path contains non ascii chars (in my case
"?") the plugin returns a python error and does not add the layer to the
canvas.


cheers

May I add: "... to the same recipients you deliver the binary".

You basically need to give your _customer_ a better service:
access to the sources and the license to modify it and redistribute it.

Hi Dev,


Today i had open one image in WGS84/Geographic. The QGIS (trunk 15118) ask
me for setting the reference system of image.

When image have the one projection system reference, the QGIS don?t ask
about system reference.

The QGIS 1.6 open the image in WGS84/Geographic without asking about the
reference system.

I use a Dijkstra algorithm. The graph construction part can have problem. Please test. If you find a bug then send me your data (or add ticket to qgis trac).

I have to set up a system to test your results against other methods -
ideas?

I was unclear: the red line is shown on the screen, but not displayed in
the image saved (Save as image, File menu).

Hello Paolo, list,

OSGeo will apply soon as mentoring organisation. I'll notify the list
about updates, and suggest to keep an eye on the timeline:

Great! For GUIseppe (:P) and all would-be students, these are the
requirements:
http://www.google-melange.com/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2011/faqs#who

If you need clarification, feel free to ask in #gsoc channel on
freenode.
I look forward for a wide QGIS participation!

Cheers all,
Anne

Hi List,

I am doing a qgis based application in C++ using the qgis API. I have
several Vector layers, and in one of them I need to allow the user to edit
the attributes of the features.

I see that in the qgis code a class called QgsAttributeDialog is used for
this task, but I suspect that it is not available for API use. Am I correct?


What the best way to create an attributes editor with the API?

Hi List,

I am having some problems with a custom application that I am developing
using QGIS API regarding resize events. I have a very large vector layer
that works perfectly if the window is maximized, but the execution is
aborted when the window is restored to a non-maximized state (it tries to
redraw but it quickly yields an unexpected error).

I think that this could be related to this bug:

  http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/2714

But I don't know if there is a solution.

My operating system is Windows 7, I'm using Qt 4.7.1.

Thanks for your help.

Message-ID: <4D4A576C.60507@wildintellect.com>

So I sent someone to go download and install the Mac Standalone of QGIS
1.6, only to find out that there isn't a standalone installer anymore.
I'm sure there are reasons, and that's fine, but... I think we missed
the ball on making sure that it's easy for a new user to get started.

Looking at the page http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis
I'm guessing that only way to install QGIS now is to grab the Mac disk,
install Frameworks, then grab the GDAL and GSL frameworks packages and

Note: I think I meant to ask if the user needs to install Xcode in order
to use the frameworks. But I'm not Mac user so please straighten the record.

 Hello,

Just want you to confirm that this is a bug or not in this plugin.

When listing (refreshing) the schema/tables, if the postgis connected user
does not have permission to all schemas/tables, Python is returning a error
on line 256 on file postgis_utils.py indicating that the index i does not
exists:  items[i] = geo_item


> # merge geometry info to "items"
>    for i, geo_item in enumerate(c.fetchall()):
>     if geo_item[7]:
>      items[i] = geo_item


I can see that there are 2 queries: somehow the second query may not return
the same number of records as in the first query.

A solution that worked for me was:


> # merge geometry info to "items"
>    for i, geo_item in enumerate(c.fetchall()):
>     if geo_item[7] and i < len(items):
>      items[i] = geo_item


Sorry, Python in not my "first language" :)

Cheers,

I don't understand what's the problem. What do you mean by "an abort
from the compiler" - does it mean that your code doesn't compile? Or
is your application aborted at that point?
In what context do you call the selectedFeatures() method, what is the
expected result and what do you get instead?

Please describe your problem in more detail, otherwise we won't be

I tried to mean that my application aborted at that point.

I get the correct values.

I call it in a slot that is called when the user clicks the map with an
EmitPoint tool. But when the method ends and then the QList is destroyed,
the application aborts. I think that it has to do with the ownership of the
features, but it is strange because I'm getting a copy of the list... I
can't still figure out what is the problem. If I use a newly allocated
pointer for the List, everything works fine until I delete that object.

Sorry, please fell free to ask further questions if it is still not clear.

Thanks again.

Thanks for the report. Would you mind to send me the output from first
and second query in the scenario when you get the error (e.g. if you
run those queries manually in pgadmin or similar tool)? I believe that
the suggested fix will not work in all cases and might end up
assigning incorrect geometries to the tables, so I'd like to check it
before using your workaround.

 Hi Patrice,

 Are you aware that OGR has improved a lot in the past regarding DXF? 
 QGIS has to follow up in separating the geometry types, supporting OGR 
 feature styles, supporting blocks, etc. It is possible.

 Would you (or your employer or client) be able to sponsor this effort 
 or join the financing? We are soon meeting in Switzerland and will be 
 discussing the dxf issue. It is important for us as well. But my 
 employer already paid quite a bit for the OGR improvements. It would be 
 nice if someone else would step in for the QGIS part, financially. I 
 also know that the city of Thun would also be interested.

Message-ID: <AANLkTik2Zq80Qk=xjx80hZkOUqQYqXL_2UtRqWEoj6Vh@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

As the current QGIS extent does not exactly match any layer (even if
you do zoom to layer extent, the actual extent will depend
on your display also), I think that a button "Define from current QGIS
layer" in panel Define Default GRASS Region could be most useful.
Let me know your opinions before I fill a ticket with this wish

(the reason is that some of the GdalTools won't work because of a Python path problem)

I've never liked the standalone - too much duplication of components (frameworks) when the user wants to use other GIS software.  Even "new" users that want to use GRASS within QGIS are better off without the standalone.

I prefer not to cross-link files between pages.  It's easy to forget to update all links to a specific framework when the version changes.  Everything needed is at the top of the page under "Current Frameworks".

There is an Installation Guide link in the side menu.  I could link it to the Requirements headers to make it more prominent...

Not mentioned in any requirements, so no Xcode needed.

I tried to follow Dr. Marco Hugentobler's example from the compilation guide and since it is linux based I could not duplicate it in the windows env. no matter how I try to compile the sample I get one error after another. Right now the error message below is the latest one. Can any of you offer some direction?

Hi Agus.
I agree, that would be useful. Even more useful would be to drop the
Location/Mapset issue altogether, using on-the-fly locations.
There are several options to to this, including using WPS.
The real problem is that no user is investing in the plugin, and no
developer is regularly working on it (we at Faunalia do just occasional
fixes, the major improvements being those done during tha latest
hackfest).
Any taker?
All the best.

Did I miss Martins comments on that?  I didn't find any.

Did anyone try merges yet?

I've was going to try - but I all I managed so far is to get git (and that took
quite some amount of persuasiveness to get there - git rookie here) to checkout
trunk, rasterproviders, threading and table branch into one repository.

I'd like to work more on the forms stuff and I think the table join branch
could be a prerequisite for that.

Anything I can do to help with the merges?

Hi J?rgen

I was proposing to merge the table join branch after the threading branch 
because they would conflict in the QgsVectorLayer class. The join branch 
implements logic to manage attribute ids of joined tables (including 
consideration of uncommited attribute columns), while the threading branch 
moves the handling of uncommited changes to a related class (QgsEditingBuffer). 
So the handling of joined attribute ids would need to be adapted to the new 
situation.

Regards,
Marco

Right.  So I'm waiting for you and you're waiting for Martin.  And Martin is
probably burried alive in something completely different.

I'm just asking what I can to to help...

Sorry for not joining the discussion, first I was too busy, then I've
been away, so after 14 days I thought it's too late to join the
discussion :-)
Anyway I'm going to share my thoughts now.

I agree with Tim's goals for the 2.0 release. I also agree with the
point that we should do few releases (e.g. 1.9.x) before 2.0 that
would incrementally throw out old stuff and bring a lot of polish, so
that 2.0 will be merely a renamed 1.9.x version - in order to have a
solid release, not a feature-packed unstable release. (Probably many
people will give 2.0 a try and if it's buggy they'll wait again for
3.0). At the same time I would be a bit more modest regarding the
timeline, but as Tim noted, it looks like everyone has a different
opinion on that and his plan is quite reasonable.

One of the many things that I would like to see in 2.0 is a reworked
geometry class. I hope everyone who knows the inner working of
QgsGeometry will agree with me :-) I think boost.geometry library
(former GGL) is a strong candidate for the backend, since it starts to
mature and has several advantages over GEOS:
- allows to use our own geometry classes - no need to copy geometries
back and forth
- it's pure header library - so it's only build dependency, not
runtime dependency
It could miss some functionality that is available in geos, though - I
haven't done an extensive comparison yet.

One of the important things is how/when to merge the threading branch.
I know that just few people tried it, so I didn't get much feedback
apart from Marco's and Pirmin's comments. As of now, I am aware of
just one important blocker that prevents me to merge the branch (there
will be probably few bugs, but I don't think of them as critical).

The blocker is the issue of threading vs python. Python in general is
not a great friend with threading - it has an infamous Global
Interpreter Lock (GIL) which ensures that only one thread in
application can run Python code. To enable threaded applications, GIL
is unlocked periodically (when running python code) and locked again
to give other threads a chance to run  The problem in QGIS shows up if
any part of the rendering stack is in Python. That could be a custom
symbol layer instance, custom renderer or a custom "plugin" layer.
Rendering freezes at that point, because Python code is waiting for
GIL, but it doesn't receive it since no Python code is running either
(in main thread) that could unlock the GIL. The question is how to
handle this situation. I had few ideas how to solve this:
- run periodically some python code in main thread, so GIL could be
acquired by rendering thread. This is lame: if called often, it eats a
lot of cpu, if called rarely the code in rendering thread progresses
slowly.
- unlock GIL manually when rendering starts and lock it again when
rendering finished. Until now I have failed to produce a result which
wouldn't crash/deadlock when tried running python code in main thread
while rendering thread is running python code. (As someone noted on
one mailing list, python documentation for this topic is clear as
mud).
- identify which parts of the rendering stack are in python and
explicitly run rendering of these layers in main branch. This would
actually avoid the whole problem and might work fine. I haven't
investigated this option yet, I'm mainly interested in an simple way
how to find out if a class is implemented in python.
I would appreciate any comments for that.

Among the smaller issues, there should be more aggressive locking to
prevent data corruption when rendering and modifying the data at the
same time (e.g. vector edit buffer, raster/vector layer properties). I
also had to remove connection pooling for postgis layers from one
server, since it's not possible to read data for more than one layer
at once from one connection. But these things can be fixed as the time
goes.

> Did anyone try merges yet?

I haven't tried to merge the code yet.

I would recommend to merge Radim's raster providers branch prior to
the threading branch, since it's much simpler. However then we will
have to make sure that rasters work correctly with the threading.

It will be useful to merge the table join branch to threading branch
first, and then update it with the zillion of commits that happened in
trunk in meanwhile. With that help, I think threading branch could be
merged to trunk much sooner. I would really appreciate that!

Hi Mohammed

Yes, it is possible to do rendering with QGIS independent of GUI. You could 
take a look at the code for the server in qgis trunk (in the src/mapserver 
directory). Basically you use QgsMapRenderer, add the layers to it and render 
into a Qt paint device (usually QImage for GUI independant tasks).

> does QGIS can be used as a framework in our application?

I hope so. Please also consider that the QGIS libraries are GPL license ( not 
LGPL ).

Marco

I am repeating my question since it may not be , is it possible to build a plugin using WinXP and Visual Studio 2008 (I assume it is)? And is there any documentation on that? Or should one copy another plugin from the trunk and try to adopt it? Or should one resort to QT only for plugin development?

Thank you,

I am struggling to build a plugin in QGIS. I was able to build the source and I could run QGIS. But I can not create a plugin. I tried to follow Dr. Marco Hugentobler's example from the compilation guide and since it is linux based I could not duplicate it in the windows env. no matter how I try to compile the sample I get one error after another. Right now the error message below is the latest one. Can any of you offer some
 direction?

Paolo,

Lots of things are interesting, but WCS isn't that trivial to do well and
there is a WCS client implementation in GDAL.  I don't dispute QGIS's
right to do alternate raster providers but every one that duplicates
something in GDAL does *feel* like a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.

I got minimal qgis gui files
qgsmapcanvas.h/.cpp
qgsmapcanvasmap.h/.cpp

Now I need minimal qgis core files. but I cant get the minimal files as I
got for gui.
Can anyone help me out.

Sorry, I missed this.
So GDAL provider is the way to go.
Much better, thanks for pointing it out.

If you're able to build QGis, you're able to build the plugins too, as QGis
has already builtin plugins. Have a look to this folder [1]. My first trial
was create a new folder in my project (in VS I mean) and setup the same
structure of the other plugins.

I am saying that it is not the same. Plugins are DLL's and setup comes 
already pre-packaged and I just had to follow instructions that were 
clear. 

With the plugins, Dr. Marco's document is written for Linux and then it is also not clear. I think the instructions given for the update of the source files are not correct. 

What are the required directories for the plugin? Do I need all the extra files cmake, .cxx, .svg, etc for the plugin to work? 

Just wondering if I am making demands that is not acceptable. If so please let me know.

Thank you,

Maaza?

I am struggling to build a plugin in QGIS. I was able to build the source and I could run QGIS. But I can not create a plugin. I tried to follow Dr. Marco Hugentobler's example from the compilation guide and since it is linux based I could not duplicate it in the windows env. no matter how I try to compile the sample I get one error after another. Right now the error message below is the latest one. Can any of you offer some

Hi Martin

> I think boost.geometry library
> (former GGL) is a strong candidate for the backend

This library looks very promising. Seems we could just use the Qt classes, 
e.g. QPolygonF for polygon rings 
(http://geometrylibrary.geodan.nl/x01__qt__example_8cpp-example.html). Like 
this, there could be a very fast transfer from the data provider to the 
rendering.

But first the threading, the raster providers and the table joins.... :-)

Marco

Yes, difficult problem with the GIL.
A simple solution would be to check the loaded python plugins and see if there 
are any with type RENDERER or MAPLAYER (maybe it would need an additional type 
for symbollayer plugins too). If so, do the rendering single threaded.

I know, there are disvantages of this approach. E.g. people could forget to 
unload the openlayers plugin even if they don't use such a layer in the 
current project. Or a plugin could use the wrong declaration and block QGIS 
(but plugins can also block QGIS because of other bugs).

However, it seems much simpler to me compared to force the python rendering 
components to the main branch.

Regards,
Marco

Why should anyone if the date is not set yet?  Maybe there should have been a
deadline for the doodle page.

Anyway, 15-17.4 seems set now.   Who closes the doodle page and fixes the date
on the wiki page?

The Doodle was set to make possible choose the best dates for you devs
(and was asked by you). I didn't realized it was a problem.

In any case the "core" devs have already voted and so I'll close the
Doodle. The dates will be then 15-17.4 and very soon I'll come out with
news (definitive venue, hotels/hostels, info about transportations,
etc.) on the wiki page. If there are no last minute changes the venue
will be just a couple of km away from the International airport, near
the centre of the city, served by metro.

Cheers

Just my two cents as you seem to lack feedback about the threading
branch:
IMHO, it is just amazing! When I saw the announcement of the Google
summer of code, I was waiting forward to test it. I made a local build
some time ago and I was impressed (even on an old dual core AMD Athlon).
I am waiting to have the branch merged to test it at work and then
probably buy a new machine for home (just for this!); I believe it will
largely solve the first (speed) of ticket
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222
 [Fast, easy and beautiful on the fly rule-based rendering of OSM maps].
I am working on improving the easiness and performance of postgis as a
qgis backend for osm data here, which I hope together with the
multi-threading  will allow to have fast on-the fly vector rendering for
huge .osm files. (Currently I have fair results for italy.osm but
performance with osm data + 25 m level curves still need to be
improved).
In short, all the best for merging the threading branch; I'll be on the
list of testers!
In addition, since OSM is a very rich and complex dataset, I believe it
is an interesting piece of data to make tests on multi-threading.
Mayeul

I think what Giovanni was implying is that you should setup to build
QGIS from source and that once you have that working your build
environment should work for plugins.

See http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Building_QGIS_from_Source#Building_on_Windows

I'm confused - you don't have to allocate any pointers for the list.
The QList class uses implicit sharing of data (like many other qt
classes), so the list can be passed by value very cheaply. Please
paste the code of the whole method if it's not too long and indicate
on what line the application crashes.

Hi Martin,

Thanks for your help. Here is the relevant code:

void MainWindow::mergeFeatures(void)
{
    if ( !this->currentLayer ) {
        QMessageBox::information( 0, tr( "Active layer is not vector" ), tr(
"The merge features tool only works on vector layers. Please select a vector
layer from the layer list" ) );
        return;
    }

    this->developmentsLayer->startEditing();

    if ( !this->developmentsLayer->isEditable() ) {
        QMessageBox::information( 0, tr( "Layer not editable" ), tr(
"Merging features can only be done for layers in editing mode. To use the
merge tool, go to  Layer->Toggle editing" ) );
        return;
    }

    const QgsFeatureIds &featureIdSet =
this->currentLayer->selectedFeaturesIds();
    if ( featureIdSet.size() < 2 ) {
        QMessageBox::information( 0, tr( "Not enough features selected" ),
tr( "The merge tool requires at least two selected features" ) );
        return;
    }

    //get initial selection (may be altered by attribute merge dialog later)
    QgsFeatureList &featureList = this->currentLayer->selectedFeatures();
//get QList<QgsFeature>
    bool canceled;
    QgsGeometry* unionGeom = unionGeometries( this->currentLayer,
featureList, canceled );
    if(!unionGeom) {
        if (!canceled) {
            QMessageBox::critical( 0, tr( "Merge failed" ), tr( "An error
occured during the merge operation" ) );
        }
        return;
    }

    this->developmentsLayer->beginEditCommand( tr( "Merged features" ) );

  //create new feature
  QgsFeature newFeature;
  newFeature.setGeometry( unionGeom );

  this->developmentsLayer->addFeature( newFeature, false );

  this->statusBar()->showMessage( tr("Saving new Development Project..."));

  this->developmentsLayer->endEditCommand();
  this->developmentsLayer->commitChanges();

  this->currentLayer->removeSelection();

  this->statusBar()->showMessage( tr("Project saved."));
}

Then, at method end, it yields:

Debug Assertion Failed!

The backtrace shows the call to ~QList() as one of the last frames.

I'm using r15130 under Ubuntu 10.04 and there is no preview.

Under windows/trunk when selecting the preview tab it returns a python
error:


An error has occured while executing Python code:

You only store reference to a temporary list returned by
selectedFeatures(). That list is destroyed when that function
terminates, so you have an invalid reference. Store the whole list
instead, not just that reference:

QgsFeatureList featureList = .... ;

Your original post actually listed the correct version (without the
reference '&'), that's why it wasn't clear where's your problem.

By the way, QGIS contains a map tool for merging features (in
src/app), so you could save your work by using that code instead of
writing similar code again.

Sorry for the mistake Martin, it gives an exception with and without the &.

I know about the QGIS tool, my version is copied from that code, but without
some layer checks that are not neede in my application.

Thanks again for your help!

Thank you Alex:
I did build earlier using the instructions given on the web that you referred to. I was also able to run the QGIS (the built version) executable (after manually copying several libraries that were needed).

I now wanted to add my own plugin.That is when the real challenge started. I could compile the dll's that came from the trunk. I tried to add my own project following the plugin development directions and I could not get very far. That is where I am today. 

I do have experience with C++ and visual studio. I have written a few standalone applications that I want to run from within QGIS. 

Right now I am trying to make a simple dll as per the instructions given on the web and it has not gotten me anywhere. 

I tried rerunning CMake and I get a new error that I did not get before, and if anyone of you have any idea why let me know. I do have SIP installed and I even went to the extent of compiling it myself and CMake still could not find it.

Quantum GIS version: 1.7.0 Trunk (10700)

I think what Giovanni was implying is that you should setup to build
QGIS from source and that once you have that working your build
environment should work for plugins.

See http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Building_QGIS_from_Source#Building_on_Windows

I started working on something similar the other day as I could not get this
patch to apply and thought about a different way of going about it.

The general idea is to use a QMdiArea(tabbed or floating) as the central
widget for QGisApp class.  You can then create a new window using
QMdiArea.addSubWindow(QgsMapCanvas).  You would then connect to the sub
window changed event to know when the user changed windows in order to
update the legend, undo stack, tool etc.

The general layout and rules are:

   1. There is only one active canvas at a time.
   2. The active canvas is stored in the mMapCanvas QgisApp variable.  This
   is updated when the user clicks on the map or tab eg on subWindowChanged
   signal
   3. When the user clicks a tool it sets the tool for the current canvas
   active via.  mMapCanvas.setMapTool({maptool}  the map tools canvas is
   updated using {maptool}.setCanvas(mMapCanvas).  This means there is only one
   instance of {mapTool} just it's canvas gets changed.
   4. On subWindowChanged the legends canvas is updated to reflect the new
   maps layers.
   5. Opening a vector layer opens it in the curent active canvas.
   6. Try a limit the amount of new code code added, try and use as much
   that is already there.
   7. Being able to switch between tabbed or floating windows would be very
   powerful.

I know this is no easy task, no matter which way you run with it.  And there
a lot of user cases which needed to be taken into account.

I was thinking about pushing what I have to git hub tonight if anyone is
interested.

Just my thoughts on the subject.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Poor asynchronous performance of Python threads?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikAWJDE3cE2MTdUWH3ZOMO-HBToO7fip8m9me1Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

I have been playing around with the development branch of IPython (0.11-dev)
as they have built a PyQt-based console that supports all sorts of awesome
features like tab-completion, paged browsing of function code and
docstrings, and Pygments-powered syntax highlighting in addition to the
normal IPython goodness.  I slapped together a quick plugin that adds an
IPython-based console to QGIS.  The code is available at:

    https://github.com/Sharpie/qgis-ipython

To use it, you will need to install ZeroMQ, pyzmq, pygments and the dev
version of IPython from:

    https://github.com/ipython/ipython

The console fires up allright, but unfortunately very, very, very slow.
 There is about ~1-2 seconds of lag between invoking a command
and receiving a response.  For comparison, I threw together a minimal PyQGIS
application that also uses the IPython console:

    https://gist.github.com/817914

The PyQGIS version is very snappy and there is no lag.  I suspect the
difference is due to the PyQt widget is talking to an external IPython
process through ZeroMQ.  When a command is executed, the console sends a
message and then a Python thread waits for the response.  With PyQGIS,
Python is controlling the execution of the entire application.  However,
when the console is used as a plugin it is running in an embedded
interpreter and it looks like QGIS takes a while to schedule the execution
of the Python threads.

Does anyone have any suggestions for solving or working around this issue?

-Charlie

My GDAL has WCS support. It is unclear however if and how could I open

Message-ID: <8E6F8FB3-A321-4EBA-9FDE-A5EAD24283B4@northstargeographics.com>

Folks,

To those of you who had signed up to attend my Quantum GIS workshop at last year's FOSS4G Conference in Barcelona, this letter to you is long overdue.

Please accept my most sincere and most earnest apology for failing to appear to teach the workshop last year.  The reasons were complex, but nevertheless I wanted to acknowledge my failing.  I disappointing the attendees, the larger QGIS and FOSS4G communities and suspect lost credibility among some of you and the FOSS4G organizers.  I have sent a separate letter directly to Oscar Fonts and Pirmin Kalberer expressing this same message.  I cannot amply describe my regret and embarrassment; the damage is done.

In the spirit of making amends, I would like to offer to teach a free webinar workshop on GeoNetwork OpenSource for anyone who had signed up for that workshop.  I know it's not exactly the same but I'd like to extent the offer all the same.  I will be communicating with the organizers of last years conference, asking them to extend this offer to those who had signed up for the workshop.


Many Regards,

Paolo,

I believe that would be desirable.  Then the GUI dialog could write the
WCS control file.  Note that the only two things required in the control
file are the Service URL and the coverage name.  But to offer the user
a list of coverage names you would need to actually fetch the capabilities
document - something I felt was out of scope for GDAL.

I believe ArcGIS has a dialog that does these steps.

PS. The wcs service file does not actually need to be written to disk if
you want to avoid problems with temporary files.  But doing so is good in
that it is used to cache details about the coverage for future use, and it
gives the end user a file where they can tweak some of the odder parameters.

Best regards,

Hi Giovanni

I can replicate the problem. Looks like the map canvas is not
refreshed sufficiently after recent changes in map canvas refreshing
code. Because if you resize the postgis manager window, the preview
starts working again. So it's something we should fix in map canvas.

Yes, I need help until I find a solution to the plugin development. 

I may have to hire my own plugin consultant to overcome this handicap. 

I resorted to my working copy (I am glad I kept a copy of the 
source and project files of the previous compilation) and now I 
need help to see why it is not able to find the PyQT4 python
module. Any ideas where it is hiding?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin SD4PP: error in rJava and iplots
Message-ID: <4d3c1a29ec07fd5f339af8616a10540b@localhost>

Hi all.
On Debian testing, I installed 
aptitude install r-cran-rjava
and
install.packages("iplots", dependencies = TRUE)
but I still get an error:

Error : .onLoad failed in loadNamespace() for 'rJava', details:
  call: dyn.load(file, DLLpath = DLLpath, ...)
  error: unable to load shared object
'/usr/lib/R/site-library/rJava/libs/rJava.so':
  libjvm.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
LoadRlib | loadIplot | iplots load error. 
LoadRlib | loadAutomap | automap package loaded. 

Any hint?
Thanks.

Thanks for that Asli, looks really good.   I have only had a quick look
through but noticed a few things that I might be able to work on to fix the
user experience.

Good work.

It would be good to get one of these done every now and then in order to
make sure we are making things easy for the users.

I've shared a document with you:

USABILITY ANALYSIS OF QUANTUM GIS.pdf
https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B1OP4EhyYSeMZDdjMTZiOTYtNWJiYi00OGI4LWI3MGYtNjIxZWZmZTIzZDhl&hl=en&invite=CIqekpYG

It's not an attachment -- it's stored online at Google Docs. To open this  
document, just click the link above.

I hope you can find it. The name of the doc is "Usability Analysis of  
Quantum Gis".

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Memory problems in QGIS Application
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=tnWhekZS0TZ_o87Ek586vb1JAEC6edyHaEKWO@mail.gmail.com>

I've been experiencing memory problems with a QGIS Application that I'm
doing with the QGIS API.

I tried to make the minimal application that seg faults, and I found this:

INT WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
    PSTR lpCmdLine, INT nCmdShow)
{
  // Start the Application
  int argc = 0;
  QgsApplication app(argc, 0, TRUE);
  MainWindow * mypMainWindow = new MainWindow();
  [...]



MainWindow::MainWindow(QWidget* parent, Qt::WFlags fl)
    : QMainWindow(parent,fl)
{
  QgsMapCanvas *m = new QgsMapCanvas(this);
  delete m;
  [...]


Visual Studio closes the application with:

Unhandled exception at 0x773c2016 in ???????????????.exe: 0xC0000005: Access
violation reading location 0x174bdc83.

Stopping at line "delete m;"

Any clue? Thanks in advance.

Message-ID: <491967.90548.qm@web33707.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Anyone knows or has documentation to help me progress with the plugin development? 

Here is my status. 

I use windows XP and Visual C++ Express 2008. I have a working copy of a build that I was able to compile QGIS. I tried inserting a project and making a plugin from scratch, and I find it needs a lot of other libraries. I then tried copying an existing plugin and tried to modify it, and it seems there are too many files that are needed to compile plugin and it just keeps giving error message after another. Do we have a minimum number set of headers/libraries/files that are required to compile a plugin? 

Is there any guide for the windows platform on plugin development? 
I have looked at the Linux plugin sample given in the introduction developer document and have tried to follow it in Windows and I have not been able to compile the plugin. 

Thank you,

Maaza

Yes, I need help until I find a solution to the plugin development. 

I may have to hire my own plugin consultant to overcome this handicap. 

I resorted to my working copy (I am glad I kept a copy of the 
source and project files of the previous compilation) and now I 
need help to see why it is not able to find the PyQT4 python
module. Any ideas where it is hiding?

Hi,

One issue, if you are testing with users familiar with other GIS, is 
that they are biased towards a specific product. If you test with a 
ArcGIS or MapInfo user they will regard anything that behaves different 
as inferior or difficult.

For this reason it would be interesting to have study with users who are 
completely new to a GIS and haven't used a different product before. Did 
you consider to do a study with people unfamiliar with GIS? Just because 
ArcGIS or Mapinfo does something one way, it doesn't mean that we need 
to copy this behavior (like gvSIG does it with ArcView 3). It is similar 
with terms. Just because ArcGIS defines something, it does not mean it 
is the best, generally understandable and expected term.

Nevertheless your study is very interesting - thank you for conducting 
it and sharing it. It shows that there is still a lot do regarding 
usability and it provides some concrete hints where we could improve.

The Georectification task is something where I also experienced with my 
users that they weren't able to do complete everything without my help. 
This particular task, while technically solved and functionality wise 
complete, would need some additional help and guiding, especially for 
new users.

I will have to study your report in more detail to draw more 
conclusions. Thank you very much for your contribution!

Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] "Official" code for data-mining
Message-ID: <4D56B808.6090309@icarto.es>

Hello there,

a couple of colleagues and I are working on data-mining some foss4g 
software repositories to better understand how the community works.

In order to analyze QGIS software base, we think is a good idea to take 
the code from the last official release:
http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/Release-1_6_0/

As far as I know, QGIS has some external plugins (some official and some 
not) and also has integration with GRASS. In this early stage of our 
study, we plan to analyze the "core" features in the trunk of 
development, taking away optional plugins for now.

So, I'm interested to know if the link to code below is a "complete" 
picture of what last official release of QGIS integrates. It would be 
also useful to know if you consider relevant to add to our study other 
external repositories to that one *or* delete from this study some of 
the code (plugins, ...) in that branch.

What do you think?

best,
amaneiro

Hi,

you're not very clear what exactly you want.

But, if you want a one time imagefile of a map from a shapefile, use 
'Save as Image' from the File menu.

If you want to do some python coding for a plugin, please have a look in 
to for example the "Html Image Map plugin", that one saves an image from 
current map. Minimal code from Python console in a running qgis:

qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().saveAsImage("/tmp/mymap.png")

If you want a server process generating maps from the (changing?) 
shapefile, you need a WMS (Web Mapping Server). You can use QGIS 
mapserver for that: http://karlinapp.ethz.ch/qgis_wms/. But even more 
famous ones like Minnesote Mapserver (mapserver.org), or Geoserver 
(geoserver.org).

If you want to develop a python(!) plugin you do not need to compile QGIS.

You can install a stable qgis-version on you machine, and if you see the 
  python console in the Plugins menu, you have all the tools to write a 
plugin (without it's own dialog though).

Please read http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Writing_Python_Plugins (see the 
Windows remarks at the bottom and use one of the 'generate myfirst 
plugin pages').

IF you want to have your own dialogs, you will need to install QT and 
it's python bindings, because using QT-developer you can then generate 
the neccesary .ui files for you dialogs.

I am trying to build an online shapefile viewer using qgis as a backend. for
that i need to render qgis output to a image(.png) file
I cannot use QgsMapCanvas class because it requires QApplication I cannot
use any class from qgis_gui
but qgis_core can be used.


 QgsVectorLayer * mypLayer = new QgsVectorLayer(myLayerPath,
myLayerBaseName, myProviderName);
  QgsSingleSymbolRenderer *mypRenderer = new
QgsSingleSymbolRenderer(mypLayer->geometryType());
  QList<QgsMapCanvasLayer> myLayerSet;
  mypLayer->setRenderer(mypRenderer);

  if (mypLayer->isValid())
  {
    cout << "Layer is valid";
  }
  else
  {
    cout << "Layer is NOT valid";
    return;
  }

the following code works for me in Wt. It prints layer is valid or invalid
according to the parameters to QgsVectorLayer()
can I set mypLayer->setRenderer of the above code to an image file so that
rendering occurs on a image file of my choice?

It hope now the problem is clear.Now can you help me?

Nope, sorry I'm not that deep into cpp coding.

But from what you write it seems that you actually want a WMS. So why 
not have a look at the mapserver_qgis WMS? This can generate an image 
from a given qgis-project file for you. It's also probably interesting 
to look into that code https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/trunk/qgis/src/mapserver/

Actually I'm also wondering if it would be easy to build a mini python 
application which:
1) reads a qgs project file (see mapserver export plugin for that)
2) then paints the map on a given hidden mapcanvas of a given size and 
bbox (this is the hard part I think?)
3) writes this to an image

Maybe somebody else?

yes - I also think that what Mohammed is trying to do is already 
supported out of the box from QGIS server. It can ready a QGIS project 
file and use it as the WMS configuration, it can read shp-files and 
convert it into raster files (png/jpg/gif) using the standardized WMS 
protocol.

What else would you want that QGIS server doesn't already provide?

On the other hand, if you want to develop a C++ plugin, what you need is to
be able to compile qgis from Trunk (or any other branch).  Have a look at
the qgis site [1] and you will find a lot of information...
As well, have a look at other plugins under src/plugins to see how other
plugins are done.

Here is my status.

I use windows XP and Visual C++ Express 2008. I have a working copy of a
build that I was able to compile QGIS. I tried inserting a project and
making a plugin from scratch, and I find it needs a lot of other libraries.
I then tried copying an existing plugin and tried to modify it, and it seems
there are too many files that are needed to compile plugin and it just keeps
giving error message after another. Do we have a minimum number set of
headers/libraries/files that are required to compile a plugin?

Is there any guide for the windows platform on plugin development?
I have looked at the Linux plugin sample given in the introduction developer
document and have tried to follow it in Windows and I have not been able to
compile the plugin.

Thank you,

Maaza

Hi Andreas,


I think, when it comes to overall results of the study, the participants
were positive to the software even it was their first usage. It was
difficult and unusual for them as they get used to do these operations on
other gis software interface. Therefore, this might have brought negative
effect, as I stated in the paper. The interface is totally out of their
mental model. Once they got used to it, things would be better. I
rememberred one participant saying I would do my further digizations in this
software I found it very practical although he made errors and it took time
to finish it.  I tried to express the participants' views and make
generalizations, but it might not be that much healthy with 5 participants.
More participant input would be better.

I agree with you, with different types of users the study can be extended.
May be during the first learning stage of gis software at university, at gis
lab, this can be tested. Both usage of qgis and other software interface by
the students can be compared. But I am not sure, people unfamilliar to GIS
can do the tasks without help. Also, another usability study can be
generated with experienced Qgis users.

In the study, especially while giving the guidelines I tried to keep things
general without comparing with other software. I believe that the interface
can be unique or unfamilliar which is really appreciated by me and many
people. But in terms of usability, there can be some general and critical
points that can be really helpful in designing any interface. The layout or
the usage can be totally different from standing versions but can really
fascinate at first look. I can give the example of apple products. They are
totally different and unique but people are preferring them day by day.

I really apreciate and like your way of study and had the chance to meet
with your products.  And you are welcome, if I could made a litttle
contibution.



Thanks,
Asl?

Hi

Its just a little thing, but I'm just wondering if there is any feeling about the name of the QgsMapLayer.getLayerID() function, and whether it would be much better to just be called id().

I find the existing name hard to remember, confusing in its capitalisation, and inconsistent with the general naming conventions (for example QgsFeature.id()).  

Is there any support for deprecating this member in favour of .id()?  Or strong objection for that matter?

Cheers
Chris

Right.  Apparently that one was missed in the 1.0 API cleanup.  Fixed in
r15168.

Yes, GUI can be created on-the-fly easily. QGIS does this already in
GRASS plugin (generation of GUI for grass tools) and in dialog for
editing feature attributes.

Hi all, I am building Qgis trunk every day with debug messages.
I am testing it in basic workflow to catch some bugs.

Some application crashes are difficult to replicate.
I would like to ask, if log messages from 'gdb' and output of 'bt'
command is sufficient information in this case ?
Can I do more in case I am not able to write down exact steps to
replicate the problem ?

Message-ID: <4D590391.4020004@terglobo.nl>

Hi List,

My python plugin changes attribute values in a table using this line:

lyr.changeAttributeValue(feat.id(),fieldNum,result)

It appears to take approximately 250 ms to run single this line of code. 
That makes my plugin really slow in case I want to change a lot of 
values, which is what I want.

Does anyone know a faster way of doing this?

Thanks,
Raymond

Show the log & backtrace.  That might be enough.  We can always dig deeper, if
we need to...

Another simple solution is to call directly qgis command line to
generate a png on the fly, using the following options:
qgis --snapshot image.png --extent xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax data.shp

(for more details type "qgis --help" or "man qgis")

[I already gave you that hint on the list one month ago, but for a
different question].

Hi Rashad,
I'm not sure, but if you want to generate a raster you can use the

or, from the command line, the --snapshot option

Thanks,
your suggest is very usefull and I'm going to  follow it.
About the xml output (like --interface-description)I was referring to 
"save" button in each form.  Output is an xml file that I hope to be 
able to use for generating interfaces on-the-flyin qgis.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Icons for update spatialquery plugin
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=pQatjUJLRbHzUzeuqh_=DjDF3yvvcEwW9oj5j@mail.gmail.com>

Robert Szczepaneks,

In ticket 2634, Tim talked  to me about the possible yours help.
I need your help to make better icons of update Spatialquery Plugin.

You can see the icons in:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/attachment/ticket/2634/spatialquery_update_V.jpg

The link for download of icons:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/raw-attachment/ticket/2634/update_spatiaquery_V.zip

Below the list of icons with the information that represents:
1) select.jpg: make selection on target layer with list of FIDs.
2) selectadd.jpg: add the list of FIDs to selection(on target layer)
3) selectremove.jpg: remove of selection the features inside list of FIDs
4) selectesubsetlayer.png: create a subset for target layer with the list of
FIDs
It is the expression of query to target layer. The result is the target
layer with
only the FID's

I will appreciate your help.

Regards,
Luiz Motta

Hi Luiz,

Very nice plugin. I have added your icons request to OSGeo Graphics trac 
[1].
It should be ready in some 2 weeks. I will let you know.

Thanks Richard. I do use python. But I have standalone c++ code I want to use in qgis. I also think it more reliable to use c. 
Thanks again for your help.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bringing diagrams into labeling-ng
Message-ID: <201102151016.06173.marco.hugentobler@sourcepole.ch>

Hi devs

One thing that I wanted to do already some time ago was to bring the diagrams 
together with the pal instance that does the labeling (ng). Currently, the 
diagrams use a different pal instance and the conflict resolution does not 
detect overlaps between diagrams and labels. Also, it would be cool to use the 
label move tools for diagrams and labels.

Therefore I'm proposing a change to QgsPalLabeling. To make the system more 
extensible, it would be good to have QgsPalGeometry as an abstract base class 
and derive QgsPalLabelGeometry from it (and diagram specific classes later 
too). Each QgsPalGeometry would implement size calculation and drawing in its 
specific way.

Any objections or better ideas?

Regards,
Marco

yes, there's a faster way. You can bypass the editing buffer in
QgsVectorLayer and directly do the changes in underlying
QgsVectorDataProvider - using its changeAttributeValues() method. In
such way you can change many values at once more efficiently. Note:
the changes you do to vector data provider are committed immediately
to the data store (shapefile / database etc.) and cannot be undone.

Hi Everybody,
I'm Marco Bernasocchi, a GIS Master student at the University of Zurich.
Some of you have already met me on IRC and helped me a lot keeping up my
work with Globe Plug-in (I help Pirmin Kalberer as part of my master
Thesis), others haven't thus this mail.

End of April is my deadline for my master thesis, and thereafter I would
like to keep on contributing to Qgis, that is why I thought about trying
to take part to Google Summer of Code.
I've already discussed some ideas in IRC like adding a 3D viz library to
Qgis but I'm still open for more options and foremost I'd like to
propose something that the community really needs/wants.

So if you feel that there is a specific feature that is needed/wanted by
you/the community please let me know so that I can prepare a relevant
proposal.

thanks a lot

Marco Bernasocchi

you are asking for it so...a qt version of nviz ! integration with 
geoparaview (Qt) ! Real 3D and not 2.5D ! It would allow some delicious 
things like building volumetric geological cross-section :)

Hi all

we pleased to report that a new version of the RasterCalc plugin
with implemented comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, =, !=) and
conditional statements (like if() in r.mapcalc) is available in
GIS-Lab repository as version 0.2.

You can find some documentation that explain old and new features
at http://gis-lab.info/qa/rastercalc-eng.html

If you find any bugs, have questions or want to make suggestion
don't hesitate to contact us.

Thanks

Hi Alex.
Thanks for this. Now that Raster Calculator is in trunk (in C++), can
you help me understanding what is the difference with your plugin?
Thanks a lot.

Hi Paolo,

As far as I see native Raster Calculator doesn't has conditional
statements support only comparison operators available. Also our
plugin support expression templates and expression saving/loading.

We plan to port this functionality to native calculator in future.

I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to write the above
message. As a member of a dedicated team of QGIS developers, I am sure
I speak for all of us that it is always disappointing when QGIS is
cast in a bad light. It certainly was a lesson for us that we should
try to keep better tabs on how  our project is being represented at
FOSS4G in the future. Hopefully those who missed your workshop will
have an interest in, and enjoy attending your Geonetwork workshop -
thanks for making this offer!


Best regards

Tim

Hi

As with Juergen, I don't have much insight into the code, but the
principle sounds great to me and it would be nice to be able to
interactively place the diagrams as you have done with labels. How
would the diagram's placement be persisted? In the same way as labels
using a specified columns? Some users have requested that label
placement could work like E$RI where the labels can be turned into
graphics and placement is stored in the project file (or whatever the
ESRI equivalent of that is) - so that you don't need to have write
access to the dataset.

Anyway +1 from me, I look forward to your improvements!

Regards

Tim

Hi Volker, grazie per il tuo interessamento e il  prezioso aiuto

  I'm referring to files as "accumulated.cost.spm" attached this mail, 
generated from "Accumulated Cost Anisotropic" module GUI. Although now 
I've understand your opinion and I'm agree with you, my original idea 
was to automaticaly generate a GUI in QGIS (using pyQT) from something 
like xml file for capture parameters and past to a python script with 
saga_cmd (e.g. os.system("saga_cmd ").  In that way I hoped to avoid 
build all GUI for each saga module in QGIS. This is quite tedious but 
I'll do it.

Really I'm study raster plugin

Hi Volker, thank you for your interest and the valuable help.
About xml file,  I'm referring to files as "accumulated.cost.spm" 
attached this mail, generated from "Accumulated Cost Anisotropic" module 
GUI.
Although now I've understand your opinion and I'm agree with you, my 
original idea was to automaticaly generate a GUI in QGIS (using pyQT) 
from something like xml file for capture parameters and past to a python 
script with saga_cmd (e.g. os.system("saga_cmd ").  In that way I hoped 
to generated "on the fly" GUI and  avoid build all GUI for each saga 
module in QGIS. With the GUI I can past all parametere from GUI to 
python script.
Actually, the use of saga_api is more robust  way for programming plugin 
even If it could be more difficult for installation and configuration.
My idea is build a plugin like  Gdal-Tool 
(https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/python/plugins/GdalTools?rev=13639).


Thanks

Gianluca

I'm not really sure I understand the concept. Could you please explain
the implications of that transition?
- what will happen to the vector overlays? will that be deprecated or
kept? (AFAIK the vector overlay stuff is used just by the diagrams
plugin, so it might be a good idea to integrate diagrams directly to
PAL so simplify the whole post-rendering routine).
- what would be the impact on the labeling itself?

Beware however: in ordinary machines, hundreds of labels are enough to
keep QGIS busy for a long time. I think this should be solved, as adding
diagrams can only add to the problem.

PAL has several stages: 1. extraction of label candidates of features
2. evaluation of cost of each candidate 3. solution of the conflicts.
IIRC the slowness is caused by evaluations of cost, especially
polygons need quite complex computation. This could be approached with
a smarter evaluation that does not do so many operations. What I mean
here is that the library itself is quite fast, just one piece causes
the slowness.

Yes, the idea is to deprecate the vector overlays and to integrate the 
diagrams into QgsPalLabeling.

> - what would be the impact on the labeling itself?

Looking deeper into the code yesterday, I changed my mind and decided to leave 
QgsPalGeometry as it is. For the moment, I'm just planning to add pointer(s) 
to the diagram rendering classes to QgsPalLayerSettings and to add some 
settings parameters. That would mean no impact on the labeling itself.

I agree. The WMS benchmark also showed labeling to be a critical performance 
factor (but it is still unclear to me wether this is because text rendering, 
candidate position generation or conflict resolution). However, bringing 
together the two systems could make it easier to enhance performance for both.

The placement would be the same as for labels (stored in columns). The option 
to change the objects to graphics would be nice. Technically, it could 
probably be done by turning the labels into annotation objects 
(QgsTextAnnotation). However, this is out of scope for me at the moment.

 Hi,

 I would certainly welcome the integration of labels and diagrams to 
 avoid overlapping. I can't comment on the technical/architectural 
 issues.

 The speed is currently fine for our purposes (labeling lines and 
 integrating them with manually positioned labels). Of course it can 
 always be faster. But it works fine for us. We suppress most labels when 
 zooming out or only display major labels.

 I personally prefer the current behavior of QGIS, storing positions, 
 anchors, rotation and other label settings as separate columns in the 
 database or other data sources. These labels need to be shared in many 
 different projects and across several applications, so I don't see a 
 benefit of storing label data within a single QGIS project file. The 
 project file is just a shell/a bunch of settings. The data is the 
 jewels. Also, when storing the labels within the QGIS project file, they 
 aren't accessible to other software besides QGIS. QGIS is not like ESRI 
 that needs to lock out other systems. I usually like to see raw data 
 separated from project settings. A mixture of some data in the database 
 and some in the project file makes things more difficult to deal with 
 and less accessible.

 I am not opposing to having the label storage also in a project file, I 
 am just stating that I am personally not interested, for the above 
 reasons.

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Google summer of code - Qgis and OTB
Message-ID: <4D5B9591.2050104@cnes.fr>

Hi all,

following the discussion on the list yesterday about Google Summer of 
Code 2011. I'm asking if you could find interesting to submit a join 
project between Quantum GIS and the Orfeo Toolbox : 
www.orfeo-toolbox.org.  OTB is targeting remote sensing image processing 
(mainly very high resolution).

There were some developments in the past to bring some OTB 
functionnalities inside qgis. After discussion during the foss4g 
conference, developments were doneto increase interactions between these 
2 softwares.
For now all new OTB command line interfaces can be wrap automatically as 
a QGIS plugin.

There are still some improvments to do (also to facilitate the ergonomy 
of this plugin). I don't know if the kind of subject could be 
interesting for GSC 2011...

Any suggestions?

Regards,

Manuel

That sounds good, +1 for me.

I think the labels/diagrams do not have to be converted to graphics,
since that might complicate their connection with the layer and the
automatic placement (e.g. if the label text field is modified or the
placement should be recalculated because of changes in the layer).

I share Tim's opinion opinion that in future it would be good to allow
to save the placement in project file (or maybe an independent file).
While keeping the placement information in layer attributes might be
convenient for some (as commented in follow up mail from Andreas), it
has some difficulties, too:
- if a layer is used in various independent projects, the labeling
requirements might be different for each of them
- it's not very user friendly if the users need to manually add new
attributes to the layer, assign them to labeling and learn what values
to put there
- the approach using attributes is not that flexible: things like
curved labels or any custom labeling properties would be rather hard
to represent in layer's attributes

 You are right - there are arguments for both storage options.

 In case the labels are stored in the project file - would there be a 
 convenient option to export/import the labels to use them in other 
 projects as well?

 Would the labels be stored in the project coordinate system or in some 
 paper coordinate system? I'd prefer the former.

Message-ID: <1297869442.1991.76.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

finally all the pieces of the next developer meeting are in place, so
you can just have a look at the updated page

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/5._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Lisbon_2011

where you will find all the necessary infos (Venue, Hostels/Hotels,
etc.).

Let me know if you feel that something is missing.

To subscribe to the hackfest do as usual, placing your name and details
here

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/5._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Lisbon_2011#Participation

Then I guess it will be necessary to start fill the "topics" paragraph

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/5._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Lisbon_2011#Topics



As a "side" event, on the afternoon of the 14th of April we will
tentatively organize a "QGIS DAY" a informal meeting where we hope to
gather a few of the QGIS users of the Portuguese community, and have
presentations of the Portuguese Case Studies (plus this). Hopefully we
will have also at least one core QGIS developer to show the future
developments of QGIS. The venue for this event will be the same of the
Developer Meeting (see below) and will start after lunch at 02:30PM. The
program of this meeting will follow as soon as we will receive
confirmation from the invited speakers.



Cheers

Hi Volker, thank you for your interest and the valuable help.
About xml file,  I'm referring to files as "accumulated.cost.spm" 
attached this mail, generated from "Accumulated Cost Anisotropic" module 
GUI.
Although now I've understand your opinion and I'm agree with you, my 
original idea was to automaticaly generate a GUI in QGIS (using pyQT) 
from something like xml file for capture parameters and past to a python 
script with saga_cmd (e.g. os.system("saga_cmd ").  In that way I hoped 
to generated "on the fly" GUI and  avoid build all GUI for each saga 
module in QGIS. With the GUI I can past all parametere from GUI to 
python script.
Actually, the use of saga_api is more robust  way for programming plugin 
even If it could be more difficult for installation and configuration.
My idea is build a plugin like  Gdal-Tool 
(https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/browser/trunk/qgis/python/plugins/GdalTools?rev=13639). 



Thanks

Gianluca

+1 for me, provided the aim is to bring the plugin is ment to go in
trunk, or otherwise be rewritten in python, so that users can install it
easily.

Hi all,
today it happens on my Ubuntu too!

Here the fix:
1. move the resources.qrc into the main plugin dir (cadtools/)
2. edit paths to the icons in resources.qrc fitting them to the new position
3. generate the resources.py: pyrcc4 -o resources.py resources.qrc
4. change all the instances of "import resources" to "from cadtools import
resources"

And to avoid unnecessary path on the enviroment path variable:
1. open cadtools.py in editing

2. remove the following line:
sys.path.append( os.path.abspath( os.path.dirname( __file__) + '/tools' ) )

3. change all the tool import from (e.g lineintersectiontool):
from lineintersectiontool import LineIntersectionTool
to
from tools.lineintersectiontool import LineIntersectionTool
except "from cadtoolsaboutgui import CadToolsAboutGui"

4. create an empty tools/__init__.py file

And if you have time,
remove the unused cadsettings.ui and ui_cadsettings.py from the main plugin
dir

Now all should work ok!
Cheers.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] shaded relief plugin update
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=XMZw0p4Of+6W75LOP6AHy0n_gibGGbtySGKx3@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

following up on a bug report, I added a couple lines to the shaded
relief plugin which replaces a nodata value with  the mean elevation
of the DEM if it is tagged valid. I uploaded the updated plugin as
version 2.3 to the plugin repository. Please give it a try. The way to
use it  is to define a no data value in the transparency tab. There
are no UI  changes in the plugin. For most of my test cases there was
no difference between shaded relief with and without nodata values.
This is because typically the slopes around the nodata values are
steep (even with the mean elev. in place), and aspect based shading is
used which does not depend much on slope. In order to see a difference
one has to increase clip values to 89 and 90, so only diffuse
reflection is used. In cases where the nodata value is some extreme
number replacing the extreme numbers with reasonable ones makes numpy
- used for all computations - happier.

It might be possible to put a NULL value in the cells of the shaded
relief where the DEM has a NULL value, masking the shaded relief.
Would that be desirable ? The main problem there is that the shaded
relief is 8bit, so one would have to give up a number. And I am not
sure if the geotiff driver supports NULL. On the other hand, it should
be possible to transfer nodata cells from one raster to another with
other available tools. Is that the case, perhaps with the raster
calculator ?

For proper nodata support numpy would need to support NULL values in
the gradient calculation which is not the case yet but apparently will
be in their next release (2.0.0).

That's right: on the other hand, GRASS modules are autogenerated from
the xml description.
I think this second approach is much better if modules are >>10, and if
the interface of all modules is more or less constant.

All the best.

Message-ID: <1297932574.2430.10.camel@galadriel.localdomain>

Hi all!

as ideas for the GSoC are coming up, I started collecting them on a new
wiki page:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code_2011

Please fill up the items with a short summary! I also welcome devs to
sign up and choose the ideas they'd like to mentor. 

Feel free to reuse past years' ideas too. Last year the number of
accepted applications was function of the number of proposals, so the
more ideas we collect, the more students have the chance to be accepted!

all the best,
Anne

It's a project we were thinking about a couple of years ago, but the project
has stopped (we've had to move the founds to other projects) The approach
was similar to yours, but I was thinking to a lower level binding: let saga
odules read directly from Qgis in memory data structures, without having to
import/export data. In the latter case our doubt was: if we have to do that
we already have the saga gui! We didn't see the gain in having a qt
module... other than having to open saga gis.
I haven't investigated this too much, and maybe it's a lot of work to do it
(C++ code to be written, etc.), but it would give a great value to such a
module. Don't you think?

Anyway, the first steps of having a python gui interface to saga-api is
certainly foundamental.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New Symbology : merge borders on nodes for lines
Message-ID: <AANLkTikEALAQh-uDU4E7Uvx8UTuVEEzCwm3mac0UDG5g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I am trying to use the new symbology to display good looking OpenStreetMap
road data. I have not figured out how to avoir collisions of borders in the
interesections.

You can find the style applied here :
http://i.picoodle.com/0b4i0occ

And the result here :
http://i.picoodle.com/0b4i0occ

As you can see, the result is not very "classy". I would like to achieve
this kind of rendering :
http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld-cookbook/lines.html#line-with-border

Am I doing something wrong ? Or is the feature not yet available in Qgis 1.6
?

Thanks in advance

Hi Kimaidou,

In style new symbology hit 'Symbol levels'. Enable it. That is it.

Hi Robert,

Thanks a lot, I missed this. It works great.

By the way, the vocabulary used here is a bit confusing, no ?
What does "Symbol levels" means ?

I agree.  I have looked at that dialog before but didn't really understand
it.  IMHO it should be reworded into something less technical.

Whithin one symbol you define its levels. You defined two of them [1].
Then you can define in which order those symbol levels are drawn 
(rendered). And this can be defined for all the symbols used in your 
map! Great feature thanks to Martin.

Perhaps 'Symbol layer ordering' or simply 'layer order'?

I dislike "layer order" as it is confusing : do we speak of layers from the
canvas ? Or "style" layers ?
For me we should use the term "layer" in Qgis only for vector and raster
layers

Shouldnt we use a different terme for styles within one vector layer ?
We could name them "substyles"
This way  "Symbol Levels" would become "substyle order"

So correct me if I am wrong, but you can define the order with 2 different
manners :
* A/ use the arrows in [1] (left side of the ui) to change the order of the
different styles
* B/ click on "symbol levels" and change the integers in the table : this
2nd manner overwrite the first, no ?

Am I right ?

I have used the terminology from esri, I'm not sure how other GIS call
this functionality.

The whole concept of changing the default order of how symbol layers
are rendered is not that simple, so it's quite hard to find a good
name for it and GUI that wouldn't be confusing. Any ideas for
improvement are highly welcome.

 I'd prefer "Symbol layer ordering" or "Symbol levels". We need to 
 differentiate between real layers and symbol layers.

Frankly, with the introduction of symbology-ng I have created some
mess in the terminology and I am not sure how to get out of this.
Where are the problems:
- "style" - before the style referred to Layer style (i.e. renderer,
labeling). symbology-ng uses this term for a collection of symbols
(and other visual items)
- "color ramp" - a convenient source of colors for symbology-ng.
Shouldn't that be called a "colormap" since it could be either a color
gradient, colors from a palette or just a bunch of random colors?
- "layer" - there are map layers and there are symbol layers. I think
that generally speaking, a layer always means a map layer.
- "categorized" / "graduated" renderer - I remember Carson raising the
discussion that these terms are not very clear

An insight from a english native speaker and preferably a user of
several GIS would be valuable. It would be good to disambiguate the
terms.

Personally I do not like the term substyle order.

No, it is more complex. Normally when a renderer renders a map layer,
for each feature it renders symbol layers one by one and proceeds to
another feature. By enabling symbol levels you tell the renderer that
it should first render first symbol layer of each feature and then
render second symbol layer of each feature. The numbers in the symbol
level table tell in what pass a symbol layer will be drawn (smaller
number = drawing earlier).

This probably needs a better introduction in a blog post or
documentation with examples.

Thanks Martin for your explanation !
I know understand why and how activating "symbol levels" has an effect of
the rendering of my linestrings :)

As you have seen, I am no native english speaker, so I am not able to help
find the proper vocabulary. (I do not like substyle any more :) )

We need to look at Mapserver, OpenLayers, GeoServers, SLD cookbook to find
which terms they use, IMHO.

By the way, the SLD specifications uses the terme "FeatureTypeStyle" : I
think it's a good candidate :)

See http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/styling/sld-cookbook/lines.html

If you'll count an Australian as an English speaker...

I'd prefer "colormap", for the reason that you give.

With "categorized" and "graduated" I think that they are clear enough, but not what I would expect. If you were making a graph I was taught "discrete" and "continuous" to describe these data types, and that is what I'd expect. 
The problem is categorized. Categorized data is data that's been grouped into subsets (bins). So even the "graduated" data becomes categorized. 
(Take a set of numbers between 1 and 50 {1,2,11,13,22,24,33,35,44,46}, which I treat as "graduated" data. I could then categorize them into 5 groups of equal ranges {1,2}{11,13}{22,24}{33,35}{44,46} )

For the rest, I've not really used the new symbology enough to comment on.

I've some experience with Mapinfo and I don't think they way it did symbols is comparable to this. This is better.

-ramon.

Confirmed:
Win 7,
OSGeo-Installer,
QGIS 1.7 r15172

"Failed backuping the old table to 
C:/Users/blaschka/Documents/Working/tests/carto1.dbf~

The layer won't be changed, please use the Save As button."

I tried to insert a new column...


On Kubuntu, QGIS 1.7 r15162 it works...

Message-ID: <401219.24430.qm@web33704.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I again want to bring up the issue of how to create a small plugin using c++ in Windows Visual C++ Express. 

I copied the delimited text project and renamed the files and if it is a
 regular compilation, it should just compile the existing files. But the
 setup seems to generates the c++ headers and source 
files automatically. Why does it do that? How can I make it stop doing this? 

If any of you QGIS gurus are able to provide some insight into the settings that must be in place to compile a small plugin, you will be helping me much. 

Any help is greatly appreciated,

Maaza

Hi  Johan, thank you for your  interesting, suggestion and help:

I think to use a 2-level menu (libraries/modules)

I'm agree, is an important decision and I'm  still thinking about but, 
thanks to suggestions, now I've a quite precise idea

I'm starting with grid module but I hope to work with overall saga modules

Yes, I need to make a file conversion via gdal (yes, we can do it) for

I'm glad to see I'm not the only one working on this. I spent hours
designing qgis styles for OSM data and creating a patch. You can work on
testing or improving this instead of starting from scratch, see this:
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222
I am currently writing a tutorial on how to do this, the squeleton of
the tutorial is here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_data
I've just added one sample map on the wiki.
There is a 2 MB limit for the wiki, just ask me  if you want more
samples by private mail [French is fine ;-)], I'll send them.

I already have this; the problem is I do not know how to share a

forum but did not received a precise answer (or I did not understand
it). Anyone having  ideas on sharing this?

Message-ID: <798151.37188.qm@web33705.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Can it be possible to create a minimalist plugin using c++ in Windows Visual C++ Express without using all the bells and whistles that are in the other plugins such as CMakelists? 

Your help may make a difference between using Python and C++. I was able to copy a Python plugin and easily adopt it to my own version of a plugin. I was able to add and remove GUI items by just editing the UI file. I want to do something similar using C++. Is it impossible for a new comer? Do I need a Computer Science degree to? But it should not be as they say "Rocket science" to write a little function. 

I promise if I get it to work, I will share it with those who are suffering the famine for information. I am not sure why there is lack of documentation on such a simple matter or may be it is not simple or it is esoteric because it is highly dependent on many secret doors and passageways. 

I confess my stubbornness to use C++ is due to the type of work being a bit intensive and I also have already a C++ code for it and I just need a nicer interface and data store that is free as in "Free Chai" inside QGIS.

Anybody there listening to the call from QGIS (Quiet or Slow GIS) desert?? ?? 

Maaza

Maaza, I think your approach doesn't help to give you a hand.
The community cannot supply you the *time* you should invest in trying and,
maybe, learning the necessary basics to do what you need. You shoud try and
try and the, eventually, ask about things that go wrong.

QGis plugins are C++, with some macros defined by Qt. Nothing more, nothing
less (am I wrong?). If you're able to compile C++ code in Visual Studio, you
don't need to rely on Cmakelist. It can help, because it makes a lot of work
for you, and you can be inspired by other plugins. But you also can build
and link the usual way.

Have you read the "QGIS Coding and Compilation Guide" [1]?

Hi Maaza,

one of the reasons it's so quiet, is that we do not have that much
windows developers  :-)
Most c++ work is done on linux.

Every now and then there are people asking on the list to compile stuff
on Windows using either Visual Studio or other tools. But apparently
they fail OR start using linux  :-)

I would say:
either use python, OR load ubuntu on one of your (virtual) machines, and
compile qgis that way, (on ubuntu it's really easy, even I can do that
 ;-)  ) and build you cpp plugin on linux.

If you have compile troubles on linux, I think there will be more people
able to help you (as said: it's not that people do not want to help you,
just there is not so much visual studio / windows knowledge around).

Hope this helps,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Richard,
I'm not an expert QGis/C++ developer, but have been able to build qgis and
various single plugins with Visual Studio 2008 Express easily, thanks to the
development dependencies provided by Osgeo4w.
It's not that hard. Look at these notes:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Building_QGIS_from_Source#Building_with_Microsoft_Visual_Studio


Anyway, the problem for Maaza seems to be Cmake. You don't need to use it if
you don't want to. It's quite necessary to pass through it if you want to
build Qgis instead...

Just a late thought on this related to the naming. Instead of having a
separate dialogue for the symbol layers, why not have the order they
appear in the main style dialogue define the rendering order (see
i.picoodle.com/8b7i0rot). That seems natural to me.

Cheers,
Robert

Subject: [Qgis-developer] slowness reading shp
Message-ID: <1298044029.29584.107.camel@ursus.ufficio.net>

Hi all.
I return on the old bug  https://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/1978
I have done some testing, and in fact QGIS is almost unusable with large
and complex data sets (see e.g.
https://int.faunalia.it/~paolo/slow.tar.gz ). Adding caching helps, but
this is proving to be a real stumbling block, preventing real world use
in some cases. I checked, and unfortunately proprietary sw opens the
same file much faster, and subsequent zooming and panning etc. is also
much smoother. According to the trac, also other free sw is much faster.
Can someone help me understand in which direction to work to solve this?
All the best.

This process is called discretization (the words classification or
categorization are more general). See:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretization_of_continuous_features

Similar words are used in French (discr?tisation), Italien
(discretizzazione), German (diskretisierung), Hungarian
(diskretizacija), Polish (dyskretyzacja)...

Hence "Discretized data" seems a good candidate to me. ("donn?es
discr?tis?es" in French, the rest is left as an exercise for the
reader ;-) )
This is the standard way of calling this procedure (in the context of
map creation) in France, Switzerland and Qu?bec. Based on some googling,
it seems that the term is used but not widespread in English. Compare a
search for

discr?tisation carte

and one for 

discretization map

in google.
To have English results similar to French results, you need to search
for:

discretization map choropleth

With such a search, the term "discretization" seems to be appropriate
and very precise (still quite technical).

Still... "discretized data" is the result. When ou choose an entry in
the drop-down menu, the data are not discretized yet!
So another approach could be to name this entry "continuous data into
classes" or "classified continuous data" or a variant.

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=AGEU=E6Hb7c1ncWtDJAEctdr+ihT8YgvJA-S7@mail.gmail.com>

Devs,


I need get the name field of Feature Index of vector file.

For Shapefile provider, i can use the string "FID".

But, the database provider, example Postgis or Spatialite, i need find
the name field of Primary key use for FID.

I don't find the methods in classes QgsVectorLayer and QgsDataprovider

In OGR i have the method "GetFIDColumn" (i don't test).

The idea is add in canvas the layer with FID's selected from layer.

The example of script to use in python console QGIS:

from qgis import core, gui

lyr = qgis.utils.iface.mapCanvas().currentLayer()
addLyr = core.QgsVectorLayer(lyr.source(), "test_subset", lyr.providerType())
addLyr.setSubsetString("FID IN (0,1,2)")
core.QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(addLyr)

The script run in shapefile, but, i need find the name of "Key"  in
layer from database.

Sorry, I did not look at the version of the table manager - just as 
noted in my first mail to the version of QGIS (OSGeo-Installer, QGIS 1.7 
r15172). As the mentioned Win7-Box is at my workplace and now the 
weekend has started, I have no access until monday...

Albin

Generally the best / easiest way how to make your code available for
testing for others is to upload the plugin at pyqgis.org to the
contributed repository. Requiring development version of ipython would
be however a show stopper for most users...

An interesting issue. Why do you think that IPython uses another
process? Running the console in another process would disable the
communication between QGIS interface and the console - and that is not
really wanted. Maybe you could try to run that code in a profiler to
find out where is the bottleneck.

The "discrete" and "continuous" data types make some sense.
Still, I have an issue with this division: in mathematics "continuous"
and "discrete" terms have a different meaning: real numbers are
considered continuous, whole numbers are considered discrete. But both
real and whole numbers can be classified into ranges, even though only
real numbers are really continuous :-)

Robert,

are you referring to the dialog for defining symbol levels (the one
shown after clicking on "Symbol levels" button) or the symbol
properties dialog which shows symbol layers and their properties?

The main performance killer here is painting of borders. The layer is
rendered several times faster if you set border style to "no pen".
Also disable anti-aliasing - that also eats a lot of time. Build
spatial index to speed up rendering of small parts of the map.

The clear direction is to merge threading branch to trunk. It contains
some optimizations for rendering, plus it does not freeze while
rendering and continuously updates the map. So even when working with
huge layers, it's possible to see how rendering continues and zoom/pan
to desired region of interest without having to wait until rendering
of the last map finished.

I think there is an even better 3d option: derive it from the geotiff
(or other) file. Unless you have one of those rare files which have
nonsquare grid cells, it is perfectly possible to derive the origin
and grid cell size.
A 4th approach is doing what sextante is doing afaik: resample the
grids if they don't match.

I am annoyed when clicking "http://google-melange.com/" to get some  
information about GSOS2011 I get a blank page with nothing. That means  
this site is blocked by my school. I don't know why.

I have a question. That is how to collect ideas for applicant for QGIS in  
GSOS2011. There are only 4 ideas indeed on the page for GSOS2011 in Qgis  
wiki .

Just one note: please do not hesitate uploading the plugin even in its
first stages of development (just mark it as experimental), as soon as
it is more or less usable: in this way it will be far easier for all
interested to test it and give feedback (and perhaps get additional
developers on board).

Any idea about when it will be merged? Anyone working on this?
What performance gain would you expect with threading?

Anyway, I suspect there is something else: rendering is so much faster
in other apps that it seems to me some part (Qt?) is doing something
wrong here.

All the best.

Hi Paolo & the folks at Municipia

Awesome stuff! You may have noticed yesterday I created a separate
sponsors entry on the help menu in order to give more exposure to our
sponsors. I also set it so that it shows our historical sponsors (and

Please do _not_ add your name to the GSoC page: it is for collecting
ideas for students, not for assigning students.

GSoC has not started yet. We do not even know if OSGeo will be chosen
as a mentoring organization. According to the timeline [1], student
applications can be submitted from March 28.

I remember last year sometimes guys from China had troubles to get to

We are still in an early stage, there is still a lot of time to add
new ideas and I think some developers/users will add more entries. If
you have any ideas, feel free to add them too.

Hi

Yesterday I added a 'tip of the day' type dialog that appears when
QGIS starts. You have probably have seen a similar feature in other
applications. And no, before you ask, we are not going to implement a
'Mr. Paperclip' function next :-). Right now the tip list is rather
basic so I would like to invite everyone to submit your favourite
little tips for QGIS. Here are some guidelines:

- The tip should have a short title
- The tip content should be short - one or two paragraphs
- Simple HTML formatting can be used for the tip, including links, lists etc.
- Tips should be broadly useful and perhaps reveal functionality that
users may have otherwise overlooked.

Here is an example submission:

Title: Quick access to project properties
Content: You can quickly access the project properties dialog by
clicking on the icon in the bottom right corner of the window in the
status bar area.

If you are a developer, you can add tips directly to
src/app/qgstipfactory.cpp - it should be self explanatory what to do
when you look at the source.

Regards

Tim

 Please tell me there's a 'don't show tips anymore' checkbox on the
dialog? These things are great for beginners, but soon get in the way
when you have real work to do.

 Aw no, that would be great! Imagine:

 "Hi! It looks like you're trying to classify areas by population
sizes! Would you like me to:

   * create population densities?
   * divide into age-related population bands?


Okay, I'm being ironic this time!

Martin, I saw you cleaned the gsoc's page and changed the 3D proposal.
While a globe visualization tool is great, the proposal I submitted was 
quite a different beast as it isn't limited to WGS84 surfaces but allows 
geological volumes, volumetric dynamic flow, 3d object boundaries, etc.

Would it be possible to keep this proposal ?

Your code is ready for i18n, but I can't find those phrases in 
translation files (trunk). Are .ts files updated daily or there is 
another reason?

And one more observation. Looking for tips in general program settings, 
I found increasing number of options. Regular user can be lost...
Do you remember our discussion during hackfest considering two UI - 
simplified and advanced.
It can apply to menu elements, forms content but also to tips.

Thanks for the suggestion Martin!
Icons are available here:
http://www.mediafire.com/?344x43313q3xx8n

They are meant to be used with the tutorial here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_data

I was hoping to find something without restrictions and if possible
dedicated to open source material.
I could not find it here:
http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_map_symbol_set

There is http://www.openclipart.org (which supports multiple uploads,
collections and packages) but I cannot upload a zipped file, hence I
cannot reproduce the folder structure required for qgis to find the
right files.
So I've put the icons I'm using on mediafire:

osm_icons4qgis_v1.zip
(If I do not login often enough, this might be destroyed).

All the icons that either SJJB or myself created are copyright free
(CC-0). I do not know the status of the others (mostly, the others are
preinstalled with qgis). 
See http://www.sjjb.co.uk/mapicons/introduction

.ts are updated from time to time, but you probably can do it locally, running 
scripts/update_ts_files.ts Just make sure it haven't removed <location> tags 
from the file. Some time ago ubuntu's lupdate was removing them, but recently 
seems it's ok.

I made my own tests:

on trunk with a big 600mb (43000 features) polygon shapefile, the vector
opens in 32 seconds (new symbology, with borders, anti-aliasing
disabled).

After saving a style with no borders the shape opens in 15/16 seconds.

The problems remain in both cases when zooming/panning as there is
always a bigdelay and in between the program freezes (under Linux).

Opening the attribute table or toggling editing or selecting polygons is
a real pain.

I tested everything again after having compiled the threading branch.

The result is *much* better (with or without borders) when opening the
shape and panning/zooming, and looking at the way the geomteries are
painted in the canvas it seems to me that is the same approach used in
gvsig.

Editing/selecting is still painful (also in gvsig...).


Cheers

That's also why we do that on a regular basis.  The locations change often -
even if the strings don't.  So we'd always have loads of large commits without
any real change.

BTW

	scripts/update_ts_files.sh pl_PL

just updates one language...

Yes we need to simplifiy things down a lot for 2.0. I like the gnome
approach of give simple sensible defaults and if you really want to be
a geek you have to delve into gconf - rather than the kde4 approach
where there are so many options and tweaks its difficult to remember
what they mean and where they are in the option panels.

Sure. I changed it just because it was merely a bunch of shouts /

 Just a quick note that 'big' for a shapefile could be in any of three
dimensions:

 1: Lots of features
 2: Lots of points in each polygon or line feature
 3: Lots of attribute data in the .dbf

Now, #3 shouldn't affect shapefile rendering speed (but will have on
loading speed)/ #1 and #2 will affect the speed but in possibly
completely different areas of the code.

This case is interesting, does the new plugin infrastructure enable the 
download of themes so an user could browse them in the download manager 
? that would be cool for sharing styles and icons.

the shape I used seems quite big in all three ways. In any case the
threading branch seems the right direction at least for rendering the
geometries. Editing that huge datasets can another problem, but qgis
does not seems to be the only one with this issue: of gvsig I have
already told, kosmo renders the vector more or less the same speed of
gvsig/qgis threading but then chokes when editing. uDig is super fast
rendering the vector but then again chokes when editing.

   Hi all, 
   today it happens on my Ubuntu too!
   
   Here the fix:
   1. move the resources.qrc into the main plugin dir (cadtools/)
   2. edit paths to the icons in resources.qrc fitting them to the new
   position
   3. generate the resources.py: pyrcc4 -o resources.py resources.qrc
   4. change all the instances of "import resources" to "from cadtools
   import resources"
   
   And to avoid unnecessary path on the enviroment path variable:
   1. open cadtools.py in editing
   
   2. remove the following line:
   sys.path.append( os.path.abspath( os.path.dirname( __file__) +
   '/tools' ) )
   
   3. change all the tool import from (e.g lineintersectiontool):
   from lineintersectiontool import LineIntersectionTool
   to
   from tools.lineintersectiontool import LineIntersectionTool
   except "from cadtoolsaboutgui import CadToolsAboutGui"
   
   4. create an empty tools/__init__.py file
   
   And if you have time, 
   remove the unused cadsettings.ui and ui_cadsettings.py from the main
   plugin dir
   
   Now all should work ok!
   Cheers.

I would love to see a finished plugin eventually released to PyQGIS.
However, the code is currently little more than a proof-of-concept
prototype and is also based on a development version of IPython, so I
didn't feel like a public release on PyQGIS was appropriate at this
time.

The interesting thing about IPython is that in addition to being a
really nice Python shell it is also a framework for parallel and
distributed computing.  The 0.11 series splits the interpreter into a
separate process using ZMQ so that a single console could dispatch
jobs to several independent interpreters and those interpreters could
be running on entirely different machines.

When this framework matures, it could open up some really interesting
possibilities for dispatching computationally intensive operations
from QGIS.

At the moment, my main interest in getting IPython into QGIS is so
that it can help me develop Python plugins.  The existing Python
console is very nice, but I keep tapping the tab key in vain whenever
I forget what attributes an object has.  Currently I am working on an
IPython kernel that does not run in a separate process so it can
access objects like `qgis.utils.iface`.  Progress is slow, but
promising.

However, it would also be nice to leave the option of spawning
out-of-process shells for computationally intensive jobs.

I have given this a couple of tries.  Unfortunately I don't have much
experience using profilers so I wasn't able to learn much.  I think
the question I need to answer is: Is the delivery of messages being
delayed by the QGIS C++ code, the Python interpreter or the ZMQ event
loop?  At this point it *seems* too have something to do with the C++
code as everything runs fine in a pure PyQGIS app.

Some tools I know about that I have access to are gprof, dtrace and
valgrind---is there one that you would suggest as being particularly
suited to this task?  Do I need to recompile QGIS with some special
flags?

Well, the problem is in access to an open file. While OGR can't

conflict occurs. It affects Win XP as well.

Unfortunately I can't see any simple solution with the present tablemanager,

Noli,

Ragi Burhum has done the bulk of an implementation of an OGR provider
based on the ESRI FileGDB SDK.  I think there may still be some limits
on the types of geometry supported but that should be easily corrected.

This work is in GDAL/OGR "trunk".

Hi Borys.
Could you please leave these notes somewhere, not to me forgotten? For
the time being you can use https://trac.faunalia.it/qgis_plugins/
but I think we really need a web site with a page for each plugin, and
the possibility to add comments, statistics etc.
What is still missing to move to the new django plugin infrastructure?
I can help if necessary.
All the best.

Hi Mayeul and devs,

Mayel, I had a look at your wiki page which describes how to get and use OSM
data. I think you should speak a bit more about pre-processed shapefiles, as
it is much easier for people with no server/time/skills to open a shapefile
in Qgis than setting up a complete OSM postgresql/postgis database.

I know all the tags are not in the shapefiles, but it is a good start. See
the small qgis mapserver rendering with these shapefiles :
http://demo.3liz.fr/qgismapserver/

By, the way, I am also looking for icons to render the rich OSM poi
database, (http://demo.3liz.fr/osminterest/ ) and asked the creator of the
SJJB icons to create some more. I gave him a list 2 days ago, and he told me
he would spend some times to work on it in the coming weeks.

I will let you know when I get some information.

 Hi QGIS Developers,

 You may have heard that we plan to organize the next QGIS Hackfest 
 after the Lisbon meeting in Zurich, at ETH, the technical university. 
 (thanks Ionut!)

 The responsible persons gave us permission to host the meeting, under 
 the condition that we don't call it hackfest, but something else. We 
 discussed and suggested "code sprint". The professor already heard alarm 
 bells ringing when the term "hackfest" appears in the context of his 
 university. He was concerned that IT and security staff would not 
 support our meeting under the term "hackfest".

 The problem with the term "hackfest" is that you will have more 
 problems acquiring commercial sponsoring and also more problems finding 
 a host. Most commercial or governmental organizations would prefer 
 sponsoring a code sprint rather than a hackfest.

 May I suggest that we call it "code sprint" in the future and if you 
 agree, that we already start calling it "code sprint" for the Lisbon 
 meeting?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

 BTW: many other OS projects also call these events "code sprints" in 
 these days.

 I thought the idea behind not calling it a "code sprint" was to
encourage non-coders (graphic designers, doc writers, testers etc) to
participate? Perhaps "Developer Meeting" or "Development Meeting"
(subtle difference)?

 I'll make it to one one day. At the moment struggling with swine flu
(data analysis, not the disease itself).

You may be right. A more generic term could be good.
In fact, the event could move to a real general QGIS event, putting in
contiguous days the HF itself (ehm, CS) and an user meeting; I think
this could encourage more participation of people scared of development,
but that could contribute to the project.
All the best.

Message-ID: <1298293072.1825.56.camel@sibirica>

Hi all,

Paolo and Giuseppe had already reserved their flights and hotel room.

They will stay here

http://www.ibishotel.com/gb/hotel-2117-ibis-lisboa-saldanha/index.shtml

that is 30 minutes away from the venue by walk or 10/15 by metro.

I suggest everyone that want to come to the hackfest to start thinking
book early their flights and hotels as the hackfest days are near Easter
holidays and many tourist are expected to visit Lisbon.

You can find many good links at the usual page

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/5._QGIS_Hackfest_in_Lisbon_2011


Paolo also told me that a few of you are having problems with flights to
Lisbon. Well, have a look also for flights to Madrid or Barcelona, from
there there are many cheap connection flights with Easyjet or Vueling.
Ryanair also flights from Madrid to Porto, then you can reach Lisbon by
train.


cheers

Hi Giovanni

it would be good if you could pick e.g. one hostel and one hotel for
us which are preferred, so that the number of locations where people
stay is minimized. It is simpler and more pleasant when you can meet
with others in lobby in the morning, have a breakfast and go to the
venue in a group.

Hi have fixed some known problems:
- short data types are represented by longer types to get space for
nulls (the problem Marco found)
- avoid statistics calculation on raster load  (reported by John C. Tull)
- properties are enabled according provider capabilities

Please test.

I agree, the postgis solution currently is to complex to follow for the
beginners. But the reason why I am putting this is to show that it is
feasible to have this and that it gives good results. In ticket
http://trac.osgeo.org/qgis/ticket/3222 I advocate for fast, easy and
beautiful OSM maps with qgis: if we can get fast and beautiful maps in
the first place, then we can work together to make it easy (the ultimate
goal is to make it as easy as with the python plugin or with JOSM).

Hello everyone,
I'm making an application on the basis of that reported by Martin on the
cookbook PyQGIS Documentation,
which take this opportunity to thank!

I added a button "toggle editing" to enable or disable the editing of a
feature.

I wanted to ask,
how can I change the Vertex Marker from Cross to SemiTransparentCircle?

Thanks!

Hi Kimaidou, Hi everybody,

Kimaidou: Maybe I already created some of the icons you need. Anyway, I
wish to release the ones I created under the license SJJB used (CC-0)
and I slightly improved some of his icons. I just added some details on
this here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_data#Add_new_OSM_icons

I also put the shell scripts I wrote to generate svg coloured icons on
linux (SJJB only generated PNG coloured files). I also uploaded my new
raw 
(gray scale/script-proof) icons
( http://www.mediafire.com/?344x43313q3xx8n ). It would be an honor for
me if SJJB accepts to redistribute them with theirs!

I also uploaded my qgis styles on trac (ticket 3222): that's 225 rules
for points alone, showing 225 icons (I choose the one to focus on based
on frequency in OSM data and on icon availability, creating a few new
icons, possibly with a local bias: you cannot map a single Italian
village without an ice cream shop, so I needed to map this! ... to find
the ice cream shops more easily myself of course ;-)

To answer your comment about your email sent to SJJB icon creator:
I do not know the contact details of the creator of the SJJB icons. But
based on the following link, maybe your contact at SJJB might be
johnny_automatic: http://www.openclipart.org/search/?query=maps Am I
right?
Anyway, could you give me his email and/or forward this message to him?
Thanks.

Hope this helps,
Mayeul

Hi

Eh what a pity we have to disown the name for the people which gave
rise to FOSS.  If we are going to go PC, why not lets call it the
'QGIS Community Meeting' which should be inclusive enough for all
shapes & sizes. I can see in my crystal ball a future where users self
organise and use the event to show off the work they have been doing
using QGIS, share ideas, and of course help to make the project better
by coding, translating, etc.!

Regards

Tim

Hi all.
I think we should provide an opportunity for uploading sets of icons and
styles, on the same infrastructure that we are going to use for plugins.
I'd appreciate comments on this.
All the best.

It's already on the to do list for the django web app. I'm working with
the OSGeo Graphics mailing list to try and coordinate efforts on this
since they've been thinking about the idea and have an svn folder for it.

In particular I've already started on some tools to automate keeping
collections of icons in single svg files and using inkscape to split
them into individual files for application use, while preserving
metadata about the icons in the svg files themselves. My plan at this
point is to then use a Django app to catalog the keywords tags from a
specific field in the svg xml into a searchable database and then
replicate this functionality locally as a plugin (possibly future core
item in symbology). Note, as far as I know this will only work for point
symbology right now, I do not have a plan for lines or polygon fills yet
but that's because they aren't svg based at this time.

The whole thing is still in the very early stages so I welcome
conversation on the topic and invite others to join OSGeo graphics to
really find a multi-app solution for the FOSS GIS community. It will
probably be a few months before we get anything up on the website, since
there are much higher priorities for the plugin site that still need to
be done.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] new plugin repo online
Message-ID: <1298365791.4158.45.camel@ursus.ufficio.net>

Hi all.
To me, the new plugin trac[0] looks good. There may be minor glitches,
so I urge everybody to test it out as much as possible. After that I
suggest to:
- move all the plugin from the official site[1] to the new one[2] (which
has some minor CSS issues, I believe)
- change the repo embedded address
- import all the known plugins issues from the trac[3]
- announce the change to the general public (mailing lists, website)
- set up an "auto publish" mechanism, so that developers can easily
publish and update their plugins.
After that, I would like to add features to the current app:
- description of the plugin in its main page
- comments by users
- rating by users
Do you agree with this roadmap? Is someone going to implement it?
We (Faunalia) can help if necessary.
Thanks.

Hi Salvatore

to use semi-transparent circles as vertex markers:

settings = QSettings()
settings.setValue("/qgis/digitizing/marker_style", "SemiTransparentCircle")

That code can be put somewhere in the application's initialization.
Other values are "Cross" and "None". You can also change the size of
the marker:

settigs.setValue("/qgis/digitizing/marker_size", 3)

 Next step of course is the QGis User Conference and Community Meeting!

 Sad that the word 'hack' has been taken to have negative
connotations. But hey, when we're in charge, we'll change all that! :)

Thank for your reply, Martin

I put in the my script the code you posted, but it not works.

I have imported QSettings() from PyQt4.QtCore and put the code
in class MainWindow and I get this error:

File "/home/sam/dev_qgis/src/mainwintest.py", line 32, in __init__
settings.setValue("/qgis/digitizing/marker_style", "SemiTransparentCircle")
TypeError: argument 2 of QSettings.setValue() has an invalid type

Any hint?

Thnks!

Salvatore

 Hi Alex,

 You can use SVG files for polygon fills/patterns. But I suggest that 
 those pattern definitions should be treated/organized separately from 
 point symbols. In some cases point symbols may work as patterns or the 
 other way round, but in general they are separate.

 SVG for line definitions: I only see it useful for marker lines. In the 
 new symbology you can use SVG as markers in a marker line - at a regular 
 interval or only at start/end or at the vertices.

 Thank you for your initiative.

 Andreas

You probably need to wrap the second parameter into QVariant class (I
think newer PyQt versions have this conversion automatically):

settings.setValue("/qgis/digitizing/marker_style",
QVariant("SemiTransparentCircle"))

Thanks a lot, Martin

It works!

I'll have to spend a little time to read the PyQt API Documentation!!

AFAIK it does not *require* it, but it is ture that without it it gives
lots of trouble.
Unfortunately gdal1.8 is not yet available on debian (not even in
experimental).
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Issue saving shapefiles with REAL15 values
Message-ID: <op.vra0dm1jna7rjy@anita-pc>

Hi,

I have a shapefile containing fields of type REAL15. I'd like to cut an  
area of interest out of this shapefile using QGIS "Save as ..." function.  
The resulting shapefile still has fields of type REAL15 but the contained  
values are botched, e.g. 10400000603695 becomes -2147483648.

I'm uncertain whether the problem lies with GDAL or QGIS' use of GDAL.

It would be great if this problem could be resolved. Unfortunately, I  
can't share the original (commercial) dataset.

Best wishes,
Anita Graser

You can extract just one record, and share that one.

Hi,
+1 for the style and icon repository!
Maybe you will find useful ideas in the way openclipart.org manages collections and packages.
One contributor of free icons (SJJB?) sometimes puts several icons in one file, see:
http://www.openclipart.org/detail/12368

To generate sets of icons from gray scale icons (with or without boundary) you may want to have a look at the scripts I mentioned here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Using_OpenStreetMap_data#Add_new_OSM_icons
It may be interesting to separate original svg icons that were designed to be modifiable with scripts and icons meant for end users. The above scripts replace strings in the xml so it's quite easy to understand and use, but I can help you modify it if you need to.
For the metadata/information related to an icon, it could be useful to be able to add some information about its usage in QGIS (with wich style set(s) it is used and with which rule).
For instance, there are already icons to represent those 2 different cases (with OSM data):
tourism=alpine_hut AND heating=fireplace
tourism=alpine_hut AND (heating=no OR [heating key does not exists])
Sharing this would allow the visitors to know how a specific icon is used without having to open all projects. It should be possible to extract the rules from the qml files. Just my 2 cents.

It's already on the to do list for the django web app. I'm working with
the OSGeo Graphics mailing list to try and coordinate efforts on this
since they've been thinking about the idea and have an svn folder for it.

In particular I've already started on some tools to automate keeping
collections of icons in single svg files and using inkscape to split
them into individual files for application use, while preserving
metadata about the icons in the svg files themselves. My plan at this
point is to then use a Django app to catalog the keywords tags from a
specific field in the svg xml into a searchable database and then
replicate this functionality locally as a plugin (possibly future core
item in symbology). Note, as far as I know this will only work for point
symbology right now, I do not have a plan for lines or polygon fills yet
but that's because they aren't svg based at this time.

The whole thing is still in the very early stages so I welcome
conversation on the topic and invite others to join OSGeo graphics to
really find a multi-app solution for the FOSS GIS community. It will
probably be a few months before we get anything up on the website, since
there are much higher priorities for the plugin site that still need to
be done.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,
I have a question (and I suggest a draft answer) related to icon sets for large datasets: how do you decide what are the most needed icons? For instance with OSM data, it is not possible to read with human eyes the whole world map at the scale 1:5000 nor to read all the wiki pages (and some tags do not have wiki page yet), then decide what is urgently missing.
 
When facing this question a few months ago, I created an R script [R is one of the most advanced GNU/GPL statistical software]. The R script computes some basic statistics on features missing a symbology. You give it:
- a qml QGIS style (rule-based renderer)
- a link to some OSM data
It gives you: the most frequent features without symbology, telling you by how much your coverage will be improved if you render those features. It is more advanced than websites with OSM statistics that are tag based, since here it's rule based (and a rule can use many tags).
Is anyone interested in having this R script? (Without R installed and a *very* basic knowledge of R, this is useless of course).
Mayeul

 Can you load the DBF in a spreadsheet? How do you know what the

 I dont see anything like a REAL15 in the file spec here:

ogr2ogr results in the same broken values. Looks like it's a GDAL problem.

Yes, Openoffice loads them. The header says ID,N,15,0. QGIS displays  
REAL15 in fields tab of layer properties.

The data comes with documentation.

Hi,

I used the following ogr2ogr command:

ogr2ogr -sql "select * from nw where NAME = 'Am Johannesberg'" new.shp  
nw.shp

The resulting shp contains correct geometries, but the values in ID,N,15,0  
fields are broken.

I guess that shows that it's a GDAL/OGR problem.

Thanks, best wishes,
Anita

Is the new repo ready to be used and is maintained? I uploaded my
plugin [1] a month ago and it has not been aproved by administrator
yet. The plugin is at the current state of development marked as
experimental and it needs to be generalized before it usable for
others so I might understand if the administrator felt it was not
ready for public distribution, but I expected at least some kind of
feedback if not approvement.

Also the home page of the site [2] is empty at the moment. Maybe it
shoud point to featured plugins or other content. It feels kind of
strange when the home page is empty.

Thanks.

Message-ID: <4D640FE4.40403@xs4all.nl>

hi list,

This is my first message to the qgis-developer mailing list. Thanks for 
creating Quantum GIS!


I've a question about compiling qgis (using Windows, MSVC 2008). I've 
followed the instructions on the wiki page but still get some errors:

1) Many messages about updateMicroFocus(). I've commented (most of) 
those lines to continue. Googled it and found it as a "non fixed issue" 
on Qt
http://bugreports.qt.nokia.com/browse/QTBUG-9578
The listing below still contains one of them.

2) No module named py_compile (see complete listing below). It is on my 
disk c:\OSGeo4W\apps\Python25\Lib\py_compile.py  but cannot be found 
somehow.

3) Cannot open include file: 'qnetworkconfiguration.h': indeed not in my 
Qt 4.6.2 distribution. But it is in Qt 4.7.1, will upgrade. Only used by 
sip.

4) cannot open file 'python25_d.lib', it is indeed not on my disk in 
c:\OSGeo4W. Also in listing below. Probably I've to build in release 
mode but my intent was to be able to debug things

All this is (AFAIK) related to Python, SIP. Can I skip this somehow? Or 
what else am I doing wrong or would be a solution? Does sip need another 
Qt than qgis needs?

The site still needs some work and is not ready for general use. I can publish your plugin but until all plugins are migrated and the official repo changed over, it won't be visible to the plugin installer in qgis.

Doesn't ring a bell either, but if you already use OSGeo4W anyway, why don't
you also use it's Qt?

Message-ID: <AANLkTi=R-1HU_v_up53EYD8sddnBpFGa2tUaL9wq7cX9@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,
I think the Save Layer As option for dxf and dgn are a little bit confusing
for users.
Some users have asked me "Why does it complain that the dxf can't hold this
field that I really need in the exported file?". I suppose it's because dxf
don't hold fields at al. They should be translated to text data at most.
As these two filetypes are together with other GIS formats people find it
hard to understand the difference.
Could I sugest to remove them from "Save layer as" and try to write an
exporter based on the SVG exporter?
All the best,

It is better to use Qt libs from OSGeo4W, you can find them in qt4-devel
and qt4-libs packages.

Not sure, but again seems this is because PYTHONHOME is not set

I recommend to use all dependencies from OSGeo4W. Also look at file
ms-windows\osgeo4w\package.cmd in QGIS sources. This file used for
building qgis-dev package.

As we discussed before I agree with your idea. This seems to be well 
scalable and interoperable solution.
I'm also very interested in such infrastructure, so you can rely on me 
building both applications.

I will start working with new map icons set in May-June. But there are 
many issues to discuss in the meantime on OSGeo graphics concerning your 
concept.

Well, that dialog just lists what OGR offers.  And uses our OGR based vector
file writer to export the data.   As such it mostly format agnostic.

BTW there's even online help pointing that out and even pointing to the online
documentation of OGR's formats.

Right.

>   They should be translated to text data at most.

DXF and DGN are CAD formats - very different from and much more versatile than
GIS simple features.  I don't think there can be any one-fits-all way to import
or export GIS simple features from or to DXF/DGN.

There are probably a lot of other formats in that list most people know nothing
about - every format of which has it's own set of restrictions and mapping
problems from the source to the destination format.   So this sounds more like
a documentation or educational problem to me.

How would SVG relate to DXF/DGN?

As Alex mentioned, its already on the roadmap - probably its just a
case of tweaking and configuring some existing django app out there.
There are also usefull looking apps like this:

http://code.google.com/p/django-photologue/

So before anyone writes code, take a google around and see if there is
something off-the-shelf we can just repurpose.

Tim

Maaza - once you have QGIS building from source in windows the process
for building a new plugins is quite simple. Just copy and paste a
simple plugin folder like copyright plugin, name the folder something
like myplugin or whatever and then work through each and every file in
that dir (using search and replace where it makes sense to do so) to
make it your own. Look in the CMakeLists.txt - its not that hard -
typically you just need to add your .h and .cpp files to the list. If
you are able to use linux, you can even more easily just use the
plugin_builder.py script in that src/plugins directory and it will
generate for you a 'hello world' C++ plugin.

All that said you will need to understand Qt4 to do anything useful
once you get going...

Have fun!

Tim

Hi Alexander, J?rgen,

OK, I did this now, configured cmake again, turned off the bindings (to 
avoid python/sip for the first trial) set the configuration to 
RelWithDebInfo, compiled again and yes, I have an executable, a lot of 
DLL-s and zero compilation errors. And it runs and shows a shapefile. Great.

Thanks! Barend

It's fine. The plugin site and redmine are separate.

Hi,
It's not django-based but the openclipart.org portal has all what is
needed for the svg part. The source code is not directly accessible from
the home page, so here is a direct link to the code:
https://launchpad.net/openclipart
Platform is LAMP.

IMHO svg, dxf and dgn are pretty much the same. They are all graphics based
formats.
Of course dxf and dgn also have 3D drawings, but information is stored in
style, colour and thickness.
This way I think that it's more representative to have a dxf with the styled
data (as svg) than a dxf with just the lines.
Well, playing a little with ogr and dxf I can see that it looks similar to
dgn.
It may be only an impression, but ogr could be used to represent the
information in a graphic way.
Not exactly as svg as I supose it uses the format in it's full
implementation to represent some hard graphics.
Do you think it's possible? Something like a simple exporter to fill the
default attributes (Layer, SubClasses, ExtendedEntity, Linetype,
EntityHandle, Text)? Wouldn't it mean more than the regular "You can't
export" message?
Best regards,
Mauricio

Hi devs,
I also had problems to get the startup on c++ plugins development. Mainly
because there was no Plugin Builder for C++. So we had to write everything
from scratch and many are repetitive tasks.
I though about writing a plugin builder for c++ but it never got out of
planning phase. Anyone interested in developping?
Best regards,
Mauricio

There _is_ a plugin builder for c++ plugins: it's a python script:
src/plugins/plugin_builder.py

Thanks Gary.
Who is working on this? Who is leading? What is still missing? I can
help if necessary. I think publishing it is a priority.
We should also prepare a short howto for plugin developers to learn how
to use the new site.
All the best.

Thanks for approving. I understand the switch to the new repo in QGIS
itself will happen later but it is OK for me to add
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/plugins.xml as repo myself.

Yes, it would help a lot if there was a wiki page or something
describing the current state and planned features.

Btw, is there a way (or planned way) to automatically create the
plugin zip file from a git repo and publish it on
http://plugins.qgis.org/ ?
This is a quite annoying step in the process of a plugin release.

Paolo,

a few documentation notes are available here:
https://github.com/qgis/qgis-django/blob/master/qgis/plugins/docs/introduction.rst

Specifications that I used while developing are here:
http://www.qgis.org/wiki/PluginRepository

the "plugins" application is only one of the planned applications on
plugins.qgis.org, that's why the default page doesn't point to a plugin list
view (this can be easily changed, of course).

Unfortunately, the CSS restyling that has been recently done, mostly broke
the (basic-but-working) styles that I used while developing the plugins app.
 I would suggest to whom is working on CSS that he/she would check all the
applications when changing something.

I would be happy to participate to the next meeting in Lisbon to work on
this new plugins site, I just would need some financial support to cover
accomodation and travel expenses.

That feature has been discussed, is way down at the bottom of the todo
list but is quite possible. We are looking for python programmers to try
and implement it in django if you are interested in helping.

Yes as Martin notes, and as I mentioned in my last email in this
thread "If you are able to use linux, you can even more easily just
use the plugin_builder.py script in that src/plugins directory and it
will generate for you a 'hello world' C++ plugin."

Perhaps the linux part is not relevant though as you should be able to
use it on widows with python, but I've never tried. As an interesting
history note, we have had a plugin builder script (in one form or
another) in QGIS for c++ plugins from very early on in the life of
QGIS's plugin support.

No I mean the main dialogue, please see the screencapture I attached
last time. In the list of symbols defined here, why not make the order
of the symbols defining the rendering order. Then symbols placed higher
up in the list are rendered later, this would obsolete the symbol levels
dialogue.

Cheers,
Robert

It is more complicated than just ordering the symbols. When using
'symbol levels' you actually define order of individual symbol layers.
Having two symbols (a,b) with two symbol layers each (a1, a2, b1, b2)
you should be able to specify arbitrary order of drawing the symbol
layers.

Not all combinations of ordering really make sense. Typically you want
something like: a1,b1,a2,b2 - that is first draw bottom layer of both
symbols, then draw top layer of both symbols. This produces a
desirable effect if you are drawing roads with outlines as seen in
professional maps. When you start thinking about rendering road maps
with various types of crossings, the order becomes more complex.

On Windows the plugin_builder.py works also perfectly.

[oops should also go to (actually user) list ....]

Hi Milo:

I can see them in qgis if:

1) you make the relative path to test.csv in the vrt file an absolute path
2) you remove the dots from the coordinates 112.333 (you actually mean
112333 in RD)
3) there are some strange points in the list, but 99 percent is in the
amsterdam-area  :-)

Regards,

Richard

Shouldn't it go to the dev list if the absolute path is required? I think
that assuming the vrt and the csv are in the same dir should be the first
check as ogr2ogr has no problem with it.

Hello,

Having written some C++ plugins (for Orfeo Toolbox), I have some 
feedback to give.

The current recommended procedure is to have a source build of qgis, add 
your plugin inside qgis source tree, hack a QGis CMakeLists to add the 
new plugin dir, and recompile Qgis.

In my opinion, a better approach is to build them as external project.
The idea is to be able to build a plugin on top of a prebuilt Qgis 
(libqgis-dev on ubuntu/debian, and the OSGeo4W build on windows)

That's what I have set up for the plugins I wrote, but ran into the 
following problem :
- There is no FindQgis.cmake or QGisConfig.cmake exported in the qgis 
development package (either OSGeo4W or ubuntu/debian), so importing QGis 
inside a CMake project must be done "by hand". It's ok with the QGis 
include path and the path to libqgis_core. But you have to take care of 
importing Qt also, which should be done by a FindQgis.cmake
- I had to hack some QGis #define to make it build on windows 
(GUI_EXPORT and CORE_EXPORT). Again, this should be handled by a 
ADD_DEFINITION inside a FindQgis.cmake

One other thing : it would be nice if the C++ plugins could be loaded 
from another directory than the official one.
Let's say I wrote a bunch of plugins for a specific software, I would 
like to store them in their own directory instead of messing up with the 
official plugins. Maybe it's already supported but I don't know how to 
do it...

Regards,
Julien

Thanks for the information ! I've using symbol levels to change the 
display level of the categories of a layer but never thought that it was 
also meant to "merge" line decorations. Definitely worth of being added 
in the next manual :)

Hi Milo,

I had a look at the docs of ogr vrt driver:
http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_vrt.html

it's not really necessary to use the full path, you can add a attribute
relativeToVRT="1" to the SrcDataSource element:

<SrcDataSource relativeToVRT="1">test.csv</SrcDataSource>
instead of
<SrcDataSource>test.csv</SrcDataSource>

this makes your vrt-definition also work in qgis without an absolute
path. (don't know why a relative path is working for ogr2ogr though ...)

Regards,

Richard

Thanks! Nice tip! I have read the documentation and will play arround with
setting the datatypes for my columns too, this will give me the ability to
do thematic mapping right on the csv!

One more question. I have now created the following vrt, but the DateTime is
not parsed correctly. Are extra options available for the datetime object to
tell ogr how it is formatted and thus, how it should be interpreted?

<OGRVRTDataSource>
    <OGRVRTLayer name="test">
        <SrcDataSource relativeToVRT="1">test.csv</SrcDataSource>
        <GeometryType>wkbPoint</GeometryType>
        <LayerSRS>EPSG:28992</LayerSRS>
        <GeometryField encoding="PointFromColumns" x="T X Coord Loc" y="T Y
Coord Loc"/>
    <Field name="Incident Id" type="Integer" />
    <Field name="Nr Incident" type="Integer" />
    <Field name="Dtg Start Incident" type="DateTime" />
    <Field name="Dtg Einde Incident" type="DateTime" />
    <Field name="Brw Melding Cl" type="String" />
    <Field name="Brw Melding Cl1" type="String" />
    <Field name="Brw Melding Cl2" type="String" />
    <Field name="Naam Locatie1" type="String" />
    <Field name="Postcode4pp" type="String" />
    <Field name="Plaats Naam" type="String" />
    <Field name="Gemeente Naam" type="String" />
    </OGRVRTLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>

I added the FindQGIS cmake file that I wrote for openModeller some

Ok I added support for this - see the bottom of the general options
tab in QGIS Options dialog.

Available in trunk as of r15250.

I have only tested on linux but it should work on linux & mac too.

Some time maybe you can return the favour and help me to get my otb
plugins to compile properly - I never did get them to build by
following the instructions on your wiki.... I'd have to write back to
this list with more specifics of the problem first though.

I do not quite agree it's a low priority issue: we found the publishing
process rather painful, and error prone. We use a bash script for this,
it can be used until a py program comes out.
All the best.

Hi Radim

I did some testing too. Having otf projection is coool! Id did run
into some problems with my paletted image[1] though.

If I open the image in QGIS default session (i.e. no OTF projection)
it displays fine [2].
If I enabled OTF Projection (using 900913 Google Mercator) the image
displays as all grey [3].
If I set the CRS to the native image projection (EPSG:32734), the
image does not show at all.

I still need to test with other image types properly but thought I
would give you this feedback so long.

Also I noted that for greyscale images they always seem to load with
min 0 / max 0 and I have to manually go into properties to load them
from the layer.

By the way if anyone else is using git-svn and wanting to test Radims
branch, this was the process I used to add it as a local and remote
branch in my local repo:


git config --add svn-remote.raster-providers.url
https://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/branches/raster-providers
git config --add svn-remote.raster-providers.fetch
:refs/remotes/raster-providers
git svn fetch raster-providers -r 15231
git checkout -b raster-providers -t raster-providers
git svn rebase raster-providers

Thanks to Juergen for pointing me to the relevant crannie in the
internet that showed how to do that.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugins re-organization
Message-ID: <AANLkTimh+YZjdEyvQ9UExsKwYbGosgDS-v7ZvRKgUCHT@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I think that organizing better plugins in menus it's the way to go waiting
for the new toolbox.

At the last Hackfest in Polland we went along this way creating the Database
menu as it
reduced the number of plugins in the Plugin menu and it have made easier to
find a plugin.

In this moment mostly of the plugins have only one action button, but the
current
implementation create for each plugin a submenu.
So, why do not think about a better plugins organization?

I think about few shallow changes.
For example, we could re-organize plugins in Database menu just creating
some main
sub-classes named as the databases' spatial extensions: "PostGIS",
"SpatiaLite",
"Oracle Spatial", ...
Obviously there are some plugins which are out because either
general-purpose or manage
more database's type.

The same for the Plugins menu, creating for example "Editing", "Loading",
...
We discussed something like this yet, I remember, but I'm unable to find the
previous thread.

Furthermore, this plugins re-organization could be useful also for the new
toolbox.
Ideas, thoughts and opinions are very welcome.

Regards.

I thin that many menu levels is good for new users because it organize things. But for advanced users it slows things because you have to navigate all the menu levels to reach the tool that you want.
I have two suggestions:1)A side panel with the plugins tree.2)Detachable menus, like the older TCL/TK versions of GRASS. Or like the the buttons in OpenOffice that have sub-options.

Best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] iteration over raster
Message-ID: <20110224153601.144210@gmx.net>

Hello,
I would like to write a qgis python plugin, which modifies cell values based on the values of their surrounding neighbors.

But how can I iterate over a raster layer in order to read the value of each raster cell (and its surrounding neighbors)?
Is there any method querying raster cell values

for i in range (1, numberofrows)
  for j in range (1, numberofcolumns)
     
       value=???  #read cell value of cell[i j]


Thank you very much in advance.

I do not quite agree.

In this moment you must always navigate at least 2 levels
(Database->PluginMenuName->
PluginAction),
instead after the reorganization you would navigate at least 2 levels and 3
sometimes only:

2 levels if the plugin add only one button
(Database->SubMenuName->PluginAction)
3 levels if the plugin have more than one button (Database->SubMenuName->
PluginMenuName->PluginAction)

In fact there're only few plugins which have more than one button in their
menu.

New users can find a plugins in a easier way, but also advanced users with a
lot of installed
plugins. Moreover advanced users use almost always the toolbar button to
access a plugin.

 I have two suggestions:

This is the toolbox purpose, a panel with plugins.
Waiting for it, this simple reorganization is friendly not with new users
only.

Also this solution requires some work, instead my aim is to make it easier
with no effort.

Cheers.

AFAIK in QGIS API there are no methods for modifying raster cells.
To learn about querying raster values look at qgsmaptoolidentify.cpp file
in QGIS source tree.

If you want not only read pixel values but modify them, look at GDAL
and NumPy.

You are right. For plugins like 'Postgis Manager' and 'RT_SQL' there are and will be only 2 levels. But it will be much cleaner.

Taking into account what Alister Hood said:>I seldom use most plugins, I had an other idea for plugins organization, not necessarily to be implemented now: The plugin manager could have customizable "Plugin Sets", so when you change the "Plugin Set" it disable and enables a collection of plugins. Something like the "Layers States Manager" in AutoCad (it could be "Plugin States Manager").or like the concept of "workspaces", or "perspectives" like in Eclipse IDE.

Thank you, Bob. Pity for the bad report about frequent crashes. In fact
I also had similar reports, although infrequently, about particular
(win) machines crashing very often, whereas similar ones were rather
stable.
I suppose specific installation details are to blame.
All the best.

The detachable menus might look like ArcGIS toolbox.

I am only talking about the collapsible menu tree (i.e. collapsible
listbox) in ArcGIS toolbox to organise the plugin menu and you can
resize and move around.

I hate the implementation and dialogs of ArcGIS Toolbox as well.

As long as it stays optional, such a collapsible menu tree could be  
useful. It should be optional because having two vertical areas (layer  
list + collapsible plugin menu tree) will take up a lot of screen space.

I like your idea Julien. It does not make sense to have to store all of QGIS source files for a c++ plugin to work. I think the libraries that need to be referenced should be found identified so that one may be able to just build (compile and link) the dll independently of the rest of the QGIS source.

I was able to find out why my QGIS compile failed. It appears to me that when I uninstalled Python version 2.6 and installed 2.7 something went wrong. I reinstalled Python 2.6 and now I am able to use cmake and configure and generate with out any error messages. I am thankful for your help and prayers, I might add. 

Now that I also heard that there is a build_plugin.py file that could ease my pain of creating a plugin, I am looking at it. Does it need to be run from with QGIS or what?

Just trying to break the C++ plugin barrier,
?

Hello,

Having written some C++ plugins (for Orfeo Toolbox), I have some feedback to give.

The current recommended procedure is to have a source build of qgis, add your plugin inside qgis source tree, hack a QGis CMakeLists to add the new plugin dir, and recompile Qgis.

In my opinion, a better approach is to build them as external project.
The idea is to be able to build a plugin on top of a prebuilt Qgis (libqgis-dev on ubuntu/debian, and the OSGeo4W build on windows)

That's what I have set up for the plugins I wrote, but ran into the following problem :
- There is no FindQgis.cmake or QGisConfig.cmake exported in the qgis development package (either OSGeo4W or ubuntu/debian), so importing QGis inside a CMake project must be done "by hand". It's ok with the QGis include path and the path to libqgis_core. But you have to take care of importing Qt also, which should be done by a FindQgis.cmake
- I had to hack some QGis #define to make it build on windows (GUI_EXPORT and CORE_EXPORT). Again, this should be handled by a ADD_DEFINITION inside a FindQgis.cmake

One other thing : it would be nice if the C++ plugins could be loaded from another directory than the official one.
Let's say I wrote a bunch of plugins for a specific software, I would like to store them in their own directory instead of messing up with the official plugins. Maybe it's already supported but I don't know how to do it...

Regards,
Julien

Called plugin_builder.py
For me it worked by just calling it from the command prompt (I used 
Windows).

Is there a provider_builder.py as well somewhere?

    I like it too.

    

    
      
        
          
            

              I was able to find out why my QGIS compile failed. It
              appears to me that when I uninstalled Python version 2.6
              and installed 2.7 something went wrong. I reinstalled
              Python 2.6 and now I am able to use cmake and configure
              and generate with out any error messages. I am thankful
              for your help and prayers, I might add. 

              

              Now that I also heard that there is a build_plugin.py file
              that could ease my pain of creating a plugin, I am looking
              at it. Does it need to be run from with QGIS or what?

            
          
        
      
    
    

    Called plugin_builder.py 

    For me it worked by just calling it from the command prompt (I used
    Windows).

    

    Is there a provider_builder.py as well somewhere?

    

    
      
        
          
            

              Just trying to break the C++ plugin barrier,

            
          
        
      
    
    

    Me too ;-)

Hi I will post updated details for the roadway to 1.7 over the weekend
probably. One comment on your Plugin I would like to make: I really like the
functions it brings to qgis but if we are going to include it in the final
release my feeling is that it should really have snapping option (using
pixel distance of e.g. 10px). Currently it is extremely difficult to select
the road start and end points and I fear that many users may give up trying
to use it in frustration and miss out on the great functionality it offers.
Best regards

While custom paths for c++ plugins seems to be a nice feature, I would
like to point out the problems it will bring at some point: imagine
that you compile a plugin for qgis 1.6 and keep it in this custom
directory. Some time later you upgrade qgis to 1.7. The qgis libraries
are not binary compatible between the releases, so there is a good
chance that the plugin will cause some random instabilities - it might
crash qgis on some actions or even cause qgis to fail to start.

I would strongly recommend the users willing to write 3rd party
plugins for QGIS to do that in Python - it's faster to implement, not
required to compile and much easier to distribute.

Probably the easiest way for publishing of plugins would be a python
script bundled with QGIS which would do it on request:

publish_plugin.py -user foo -pass bar  my_plugin

That would zip the "my_plugin" plugin from your local working
directory, sign you in the qgis repository, upload the plugin and
print the result (success / error). Such a script can be done very
quickly, right? Eventually a plugin could do this job, remembering the
username/password, so publishing a new version of a plugin would be a
one-click action.

Hi all.
The development version of QGIS, due shortly, is bringing us several
important new features (see eg [0]). In particular, 3D and raster
support. I know of the work being done on raster support through a
plugin (which should be integrated in PostGIS manager IMHO), but I'm not
aware of any work being done on supporting 3D features and functions
directly. Is there anybody working on this, or planning to?
All the best.

Ah sooo much better! Thanks. Another point maybe is the first time I
try to use it, it says 'not configured' and then I open the roadgraph
options dialog and simply press ok and then it works. Can you make it
work in some default way so that configuration of the plugin is not
mandatory?

Thanks for this awesome tool!

Is the plugin-API documented somewhere? Cannot find it. I find this:

http://www.qgis.org/wiki/Writing_C%2B%2B_Plugins

having a note that it is quite old.


I can imagine the API is not binary compatible for some upgrades 
(usually it is extended so then still compatible, depending on the model 
used). Is there not a mechanism to check if a plugin corresponds to the 
version of the host (qgis)? I think this is feasable...

Agreed

I don't understand this:
- if the API/ABI changes, then you might have (sometimes) the same 
problem with Python (don't know sip).
- faster to implement but C++, in general, runs faster. If I've write 
labelling or routing plugin -> I would prefer C++
- some people knew C++ better, some Python, some both, if there are two 
options, would one be deprecated?
- why easier to distribute?

I was also able to generate the visual c++ project files by using cmake-gui and you may even be surprised to hear that it compiled with out complaining and telling me it is offended by such and such item, etc. Where that leads me is still not clear but I have no complaints right now, just thanksgiving.

Hi devs,
I also had problems to get the startup on c++ plugins development. Mainly because there was no Plugin Builder for C++. So we had to write everything from scratch and many are repetitive tasks. 
I though about writing a plugin builder for c++ but it never got out of planning phase. Anyone interested in developping?

Best regards,
Mauricio

Maaza - once you have QGIS building from source in windows the process

for building a new plugins is quite simple. Just copy and paste a

simple plugin folder like copyright plugin, name the folder something

like myplugin or whatever and then work through each and every file in

that dir (using search and replace where it makes sense to do so) to

make it your own. Look in the CMakeLists.txt - its not that hard -

typically you just need to add your .h and .cpp files to the list. If

you are able to use linux, you can even more easily just use the

plugin_builder.py script in that src/plugins directory and it will

generate for you a 'hello world' C++ plugin.



All that said you will need to understand Qt4 to do anything useful

once you get going...



Have fun!

It isn't good idea, I think. User looks at the the settings window, and understands how the plugin works.

I thought about it. Many people tell me about it. I will do it to release qgis.
It is "fix GUI before code freeze".

Not exactly.  Python code is interpreted, not compiled. As long as the
plugin code remains valid Python-- moving from Python 2.x to 3.x is an
example of where this may break--and the QGIS Python API remains unchanged,
then the Python interpreter built into QGIS will be able to execute it.

True.

Nope. Python is great for rapid development, flexibility and an enormously
capable standard library.  As you noted above, C++ is great when you
absolutely need something to execute as fast as possible. Reason enough to
keep both options.


> - why easier to distribute?
>

Python code is interpreted so one does not have to compile and test a
separate binary distribution for every platform QGIS runs on. That cuts the
distribution workload by several orders of magnitude.


Of course, if you start mixing Python *Extensions* (which contain compiled
C/C++ code), into your Plugin module, then it is a whole different ballgame.

The best is to look at src/gui/qgisinterface.h which shows the various
methods and objects available to the api. You can also manipulate the
main window app from within you plugin via qGisInterface->mainWindow()

Yes the version is available within the QGIS namespace: QGis::QGIS_VERSION

We maintain backwards compatibility for API. So if a method name
changes for example the old name must remain as a wrapper for the new
method. Old methods are marked as deprecated in the docs and in major
releases (e.g. upcoming 2.0) we will shed deprecated methods from the
API.

Because we use C++ ABI compatibility is not possible between versions.
This doesnt affect python (as the plugins only need the same language
binding elements to be present) so it is an advantage for python that
its not vulnerable to lib updates.

Yes C++ is good for performance sensitive code, or where you need to
make use of additional libs that are in C++.

Not likely we are with both for the long term I think it is safe to say.

> - why easier to distribute?

As Charlie mentions in the next email, python plugins dont need to be
compiled for specific platforms, just write once, run everywhere.

Despite Martin's comments I think the plugin paths addition to options
(I'll move it into advanced options on the next options dialog
cleanup) can be handy for testing plugins and on multiuser systems
where plugins need to be shared but can't necessarily be put into the
system plugins dir because of IT policy etc.

Ok maybe at least just popup the settings dialog then.

Also I think the following label changes should be made in that dialog:

Direct direction -> Value for forward direction
Reverse direction -> Value for reverse direction
Both direction -> Value for two-way direction

Maybe it would also be good to make those combos where you pick the
value rather than text box where the user needs to know the values a
priori.

Thanks! My English is very bad. This is a very big help.

Yes, I agree. But advanced export tool and progress bar it is a priority.

Hi Tim, Charlie,

Thanks for your answers.

OK, that is useful. But I actually meant the interface a plugin has to 
implement. Of course I can look in the source and that will be 
QgisPlugin. It is small, I like it.

What I mean is this: adding one method to QgisPlugin, e.g.:
virtual int interfaceVersion() = 0;

which gives back a interface_version_number. That number only changes if 
the (plugin) interface changes. QGis can check if the plugin does 
implement the right interface.

But I now understand better that if the plugin calls back the qgis API, 
also that interface has to be stable. So in practice this will indeed 
change with every version. But anyway, even then, qgis can check that 
number as its first action and discard that plugin if the 
interface_version_number is wrong.

So IMO it is not this:
//! Version of the plugin
QString & version()

Because that is the version of the plugin, obviously, and not the 
version of the ABI/API.

Understood.

Message-ID: <767338.50256.qm@web33708.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

I had gotten used to the copying and modifying other Python plugin UI files to develop my own Python plugin instead of creating one using QT Designer. 

Is it possible to do the same in C++. If I find a starter UI from an existing plugin, can I modify it for my use in a way like that of Python? What are the things I need to know to write simple UI's to interact with the plugin application?? 

Thank you,

Maaza

Hi,
thanks for testing, there are really too many combinations of data types,
drawing styles, projections, resolutions etc. which I am not able to test all.

It is fixed now. The problem was not in the color handling but in
source resolution calculation.

For me it loads with source data type range (tested with UInt16) and
it works the same
way in trunk. QgsRasterLayerProperties are using
mRasterLayer->minimum/maximumValue()
which is by default the source data type (passed to
QgsContrastEnhancement) range.

Maybe 'Contrast enhancement' should be set to 'Stretch to MinMax' by
default for SingleBandGray?

There was little confusion in types of data read for stats calculation
for GDAL, fixed.

Thanks its working great now. The grayscale issue I was having I can't
replicate with the data I have here at home - will try again tomorrow
on my office pc with the original dataset - as far as I know that
machine is already set to stretch to min->max by default.

>From playing around a little on my samsung netbook, I would say
performance seems quite ok for raster reprojection given the CPU's on
these machines are slow.

I found two other issues:

- pyramids tab no long shows options to build pyramids (you can
replicate with that test dataset I pointed you to).
- it would be nice if the 'collar' - the part outside the image data
area in rotated images was made transparent by default.

Otherwise its looking great for a merge into trunk soon and being part of 1.7!

regards

Tim

Sorry, you were right, after selecting 'stretch to min/max' and apply,
the min max values were set wrongly. Fixed now in GDAL provider
(was missing const, uff).

I have done some more optimization today, still not the best but acceptable,
for me, the reprojection takes about 75% of time more.
BTW: compiling as Release, the reprojection time was reduced to about 25%.

Fixed. The methods were not virtual, but how on earth it could work before?

Isn't it? The data outside source data extent are null. That is the source
of all the troubles with null values handling and types remapping.
The grey border around the tif you posted is part of the image. Is not?

Sorry you are right - the issue lies with my data.

Do you have anything else left on your todo list before you can merge to trunk?

+1 from me to merge when you are ready

I would like to make some cleanups to the raster properties dialog
after you are done...hopefully I can do the ui clean upsin time for
1.7....

Tim

Exactly. This is something that should be added and checked in order
to avoid possible crashes after upgrades. Even better would be to make
it a global function in each plugin since that would avoid creation of
a new instance of that plugin which could actually make some calls to
qgis api. I would call that method e.g. 'requiredQgisVersion' and it
would always QGis::QGIS_VERSION - i.e. version of qgis used when
compiling the plugin.

Hi guys,
I added the DBmanager development, maybe this could be a good chance to
integrate some
of the database plugins.

As far as there's some work to do before turning to the new symbology (some
features work
in old symbology but are still missing in the new one), but also the new
labelling needs
some work (and maybe diagrams??), why don't we insert it as proposal?

I don't know both if there are people that are working on those feature now
and if this proposal
can conflict with people worked at those features.
Martin, do you have question about adding old-new symbology integration to
the gsoc proposal?
And about the old-new labelling system, are there reasons to not add it to
the proposal?

Cheers.

Hi,

I was testing a little today. It appears that WMS layers are not being projected. I would imagine that needs to be corrected before a merge. Also, openlayers are not correctly projecting based on some quick tests on my end. I'm not sure if this is a problem with the branch or the plugin.

Cheers,
John

Hi guys,
thanks a lot for your work! The new plugin site it's really nice.

BTW, the https login is still missing. I understand it would be one of the
last features
you'll put on.
Do you have a todo list or a roadmap? I'd like to look at it.

Cheers.

	MySQL geometries and Graduated symbol renderer
Message-ID: <AANLkTinW-hyE=u3-Xg4izntLkPCNHNcKeMb4QqnBNM3Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Martin,

I would like to propose a couple of Python snippets to be included in the
PyQGIS Cookbook.

1)  Load of MySQL geometries:
----------------------
uri =
"MySQL:dbname,host=localhost,port=3306,user=root,password=xxx|layername=my_table"
vLayer = QgsVectorLayer( uri, 'my_table', 'ogr' )
----------------------
BTW, I'm not sure if it is the best way to do it, but it works.

2) Graduated symbol renderer (Old symbology):
----------------------
fieldName = "My_Field"
numberOfClasses = 5
mFieldMap = {}

# Get the field index based on the field name
fields = layer.pendingFields()
for ( key, field ) in fields.iteritems():
    if field.type() == QVariant.Int or field.type() == QVariant.Double:

        mFieldMap[ str( field.name() ) ] = key
fieldIndex = mFieldMap[ fieldName ]

# Create the renderer object
renderer = QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer( layer.geometryType() )
renderer.setMode( QgsGraduatedSymbolRenderer.EqualInterval ) #
EqualInterval/Quantile/Empty

# Prepare the required symbol objects
symbolList = []
geom = layer.geometryType()
provider = layer.dataProvider()
for i in range( numberOfClasses ):
    symbol = QgsSymbol( geom )
    brush = QBrush()
    brush.setColor( self.randomColor() )
    brush.setStyle( Qt.SolidPattern )
    symbol.setBrush( brush )
    symbolList.append( symbol )

# Define classes
minimum = provider.minimumValue( fieldIndex ).toDouble()[ 0 ]
maximum = provider.maximumValue( fieldIndex ).toDouble()[ 0 ]
for i in range( numberOfClasses ):
    # Switch if attribute is int or double
    lower = ('%.*f' % (2, minimum + ( maximum - minimum ) / numberOfClasses
* i ) )
    upper = ('%.*f' % (2, minimum + ( maximum - minimum ) / numberOfClasses
* ( i + 1 ) ) )

    lowerString = QVariant( lower ).toString()
    upperString = QVariant( upper ).toString()
    symbolList[ i ].setLowerValue( lowerString )
    symbolList[ i ].setUpperValue( upperString )
    symbolList[ i ].setLabel( lowerString + " - " + upperString )

# Define a symbol object based on each class
for i in range( numberOfClasses ):
    symbol = symbolList[ i ]
    lower_bound = symbol.lowerValue()
    upper_bound = symbol.upperValue()
    label = symbol.label()

    sy = QgsSymbol( layer.geometryType(), lower_bound, upper_bound, label )
    sy.setFillColor( symbol.brush().color() )
    sy.setFillStyle( symbol.brush().style() )

    renderer.addSymbol( sy )

renderer.setClassificationField( fieldIndex )
layer.setRenderer( renderer )
----------------------


Regards,

Germ?n

Hi all.
I also added another idea (thanks frankie@debian): to make qgis
scriptable. I think this would be very useful for repetitive, automated
tasks.
All the best.

It looks like this:
qgsrasterprojector.* qgsrasterdataprovider.* raster/qgsrasterlayer.* : 60 TODOs
qgsgdalprovider.*: 11 TODOs
qgsgrassrasterprovider.*: 8 TODOs
qgswmsprovider.*: 53 TODOs

But all those TODOs are not really problem, IIRC, before the merge I have to add
only fall back to precise reprojection if approximation fails (easy)
and code cleanup.

The problem with data reloading on update (G. Manghi reported) I would
like to solve in trunk
because it may need QgsLayer and renderer modifications.

Then, there are some places, usually constants which have
to be checked better (e.g. max error, in reprojection, minimum source
resolution etc.)
That can still be done in trunk, I think.

BTW: The approximate reprojection could may be used also for vectors?

Paris, Rome, Milan, etc.).

If you don't find any easyjet direct flight to Lisbon consider make a
stop in Madrid: there very cheap flights (easyjet) from Madrid to
Lisbon: Madrid is very well served with Ryanair with flights from all
over Europe.

Alternatives are also checking the Vueling company (with a stop in
Madrid or Barcelona) or direct flights with TAP air Portugal.

The suggestion remain the one I already gave a few days ago: book asap,
the hackfest is near Easter holidays

That being the case, I would suggest we poll Marco and other devs to
see if it can move into trunk so that it can be more broadly tested
before the release - I don't think it will be good to merge it at the
last minute before the release for this reason.

Hmm interesting. Is there a summary of the logic you have used to do
this somewhere?

Hello all, and sorry for cross-posting,

is anyone willing to share a room? I put a note on the wiki page,
section Participants.

see you in Lisbon!

Message-ID: <H00002ea08e40fdc.1298897429.srsofaioi6145.ktso.ch@MHS>

Hi 

I'm trying to add some attributes to a memory provider but with no luck.
I pasted the code from the cookbook [1] into the python console. The
layer with the feature is added but there are no attributes in the
layer. Did I miss something? Has something changed?

Try setting the layer editable and then turning editing off.  There seems
(too me) to be a bug in the refreshing of the attributes on memory layers.

Hi,
thanks for testing, I'll look at WMS again and let you know.

Openlayers are implemented as a plugin, not provider, they will not
become automatically reprojected.

Definitely. On-the-fly reprojection of vector layers takes ages, there
are no approximations right now.

I think, that it could be merged soon, say within a week or two.

The same principle like here:
http://geo-solutions.blogspot.com/2011/01/developers-corner-improving.html
apart a different approach in control points matrix size estimation
and calculation
and other details.

Hi German,

thank you for the snippets. Would you mind to spend few more minutes
with that to add some comments and prepare a patch for the cookbook?
The sources are in SVN repository here:
http://svn.osgeo.org/qgis/docs/trunk/english_us/developer_cookbook/

That would speed up the addition to the cookbook.

Regards
Martin

Sure, a project for transition to new symbology / labeling can be added too.

Generally when adding ideas for GSoC projects, it's good to add some
details about the project. The potential students applying for GSoC
may not be very familiar with QGIS. They need to know more details -
what exactly is missing, what should be the result of such project and
maybe also some suggestions how that could be accomplished. Otherwise
the idea will be most likely overlooked. Two paragraphs should be
enough. For example, KDE had a well-done page with ideas:
http://community.kde.org/GSoC/2010/Ideas
