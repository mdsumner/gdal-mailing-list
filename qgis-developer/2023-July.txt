Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Website Donation page not working
Message-ID: <cce00b06-9266-6fd6-98db-2841a02509b5@libero.it>

Hi devs,
just to inform you that the Donation page of the QGIS website is not 
working properly, probably already for a few days (see 
https://github.com/qgis-donations).
Currently it is not possible to donate.

Going to the page at URL https://donate.qgis.org/ , the connection is 
considered insecure and the certificate invalid by Chrome and Firefox.
The following error is also reported:
NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID

The page certificate has the start validity date of June 28th, 2023 and 
CN = changelog.qgis.org

At the above URL, an "High level software project management. Made 
easy." page is shown instead of the Donation page.

Best regards.

Andrea Giudiceandrea

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] How to find pxiels per meter resolution
Message-ID: <2078648139.1870592.1688230865799@mail1.libero.it>

Hy all,

i'm developing a c++ gis using qgis api. I have a project in wgs84 projection.

I need to draw a complex poligon, so i need to find how is the pixel resolution per meters, so i can find how many pixel are in 1 meters and use this value to draw at real dimension.

How can i find the pixel per meter resolution using QGIS ?  I see that WGS84 projection use degrees as measure unit..but i need meter.

 

Thank you

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Python scripts in a Docker container
Message-ID: <CAPE+p+bbCp5RH8HduFBAf7OO+j_oVBdfUAuy58KCtLU7Q5cj6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I am trying to setup QGIS within a Docker container in order to run
standalone Python scripts, but I have a few problems.

   - I first had a No module named PyQt5.sip error which I fixed by adding
   PyQt5 in my requirements.txt file
   - Then I had a No module named qgis.core which I fixed by adding a whole
   bunch of paths at the beginning of my script (see below)
   - But now I get a ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'qgis._core' for
   which I can't find a fix...

I tried to build a Dockerfile closer to what is recommended here
<https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#debian-ubuntu> but
that seemed to put me further from my goal with libgdal30, libproj22 and
many other libraries not being able to be installed. I also have GDAL
installed, which might be a reason for these errors.

Thank you very much for your help

Hi,

I'm not answering straight the question, but you can have a look to the
Dockerfile on our working base image :
https://github.com/3liz/docker-qgis-platform/

As an example :

? cat script.py
import qgis.core
print(qgis.core.Qgis.QGIS_VERSION)

? docker run -it -v $PWD:/scripts 3liz/qgis-platform:3.28 python3
/scripts/script.py
3.28.7-Firenze

Hi,

I'm attempting to implement a updateDataSourceUriItems auth handler for AWS S3 based authentication

Details here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/53637

I think I'm misunderstanding when and how this method called when used with the GDAL raster provider, is there an example of how to set it up in python with basic http authentication?

Can anyone shed some light on this??

Hi,

It's something you can do in front of QGIS server. QGIS server is not
connected to any ACL system by default.

Or you can write a QGIS server plugin to add the authentication :
https://docs.qgis.org/3.28/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/server.html#access-control-filters

Or some open source webgis based on QGIS server are providing this feature
out of the box : Lizmap, QWC2,... and others as well

Regards,

But it has desepear with no network session. I feel my pc has a network

 It's not clear to me what part of QGIS exhibits slow performance for you,
but for me, QGIS frequently freezes due to Browser Panel trying to access
some network drives that are either too slow or not available due to remote
work (I have "Offline folders" in Windows enabled: if I am not connected to
the network directly or via VPN, QGIS freezes for about 20sec every couple
of minutes).

Have you tried closing the Browser Panel to see if you can use QGIS without
any freezes? If it is the culprit, you can then figure out which specific
network drive is causing the problem, then you can right-click on it to
hide it.

 QNetworkRequest
Message-ID: <ec201e1c-e19f-64da-db8f-6c72e02cadee@fossgis.de>

Hi,

in QGIS one can set the user-agent to a cutom value in the program 
options, but QgsNetworkAccessManager automatically adds "QGIS/.../.. " 
to the user-agent string.
Is there a way to completely set a custom user-agent string (without the 
QGIS addition?). How can I set the user-agent on QGIS plugin development 
when using QgsNetworkAccessManager with QNetworkRequest? 
QgsNetworkAccessManager seems to take care of the sytsem configuration. 
And therefore QGIS... is added there as well. How can this be changed? I 
do not want to use "requests" instead of QgsNetworkAccessManager.

Regards
Marco Lechner

Hi QGIS maintainers

I have now passed over maintenance of the MemoryLayerSaver plugin to Yoann Quenach de Quivillic.  Please could you update the Plugin settings in https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/MemoryLayerSaver/ to make yquenach the maintainer.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Exporting georeferenced plans in jpg format with
 corresponding Tab files
Message-ID: <LO4P123MB50767A46350A5B222089F8BFC736A@LO4P123MB5076.GBRP123.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi folks,

Ability to export georeferenced plans out of QGIS in jpg format

At the current time when georeferencing a plan in QGIS the georeferenced output is in tiff format only. I'd like to suggest that users are able to choose to also have the output in jpg format. Once maps have been georeferenced they often need to then be loaded into other softwares, such as street or addressing gazetteer software. As the georeferencer in QGIS currently only permits files to be output from the georeferencer in tiff format this can result in georeferenced plans that have file sizes in excess of 100mb, which can cause performance issues when loaded into other mapping systems. QGIS has the ability to convert tiff files into jpg files, however it would be very useful if the georeferencer was able to include that function within the georeferencer so that users could choose to have the georeferenced output in jpg format.

Ability to create Tab files for raster files

QGIS currently includes the functionality to export vector format feature layers into tab file format. However, the same function isn't currently available for raster datasets in QGIS though. It would be really helpful if when plans are georeferenced that the ability to create a corresponding raster Tab file was also available. In the two examples below you'll see that the Tab file in both cases is only 1Kb in size. This is because they are simple text files. Some softwares only permit raster files that have corresponding raster Tab files to be loaded into its software, so having this ability would enable greater flexibility. If QGIS was also able to create these simple tab files for raster layers it would be a great help!

[cid:image001.png at 01D9B4F7.B8800620]

[cid:image002.png at 01D9B4F7.B8800620]

Two example raster Tab files are attached. Essentially they contain coordinates relating to the associated map / plan.

I imagine that being able have georeferenced plans in jpg format will help loads of people, so it would be a good improvement I think. The ability to also create corresponding Tab files for tiff and jpg images would also knock down a few of the walls that propriety software has inadvertently created.

Kind regards,

Thanks for any suggestion!

Hi,

I believe you still can, but your DWG file version is too new. Try to save your DWG as an older version (ie 10 or 13) and it should work.

Hi Matteo,

I assume that those are provided via GDAL. Check 
https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/ for how to get a GDAL that supports them.

https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/cad.html sounds like you need to make 
sure that your GDAL was compiled with its internal libopencad or you 
could use https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/oda.html

Good luck!

Hannes

Hi,

There are actually several options and libraries for the handling of
dxf/dwg files:

- libdxfrw (patched and improved by J?rgen) and lives within the QGIS
source tree - this is used for the import/export when using the commands in
the project menu for several layer at once
- ogr ( https://gdal.org/drivers/vector/dxf.html ) - this is used when you
do layer right-click --> Export --> Save Features As ...
- ogr enhanced with the Open Design Alliance Teigha library (requires a
license agreement for distribution --> so hardly ever used). QGIS doesn't
ship with Teigha.

The third option probably gives the best results, but due the license issue
it isn't really available.

Hope this clarifies the situation a bit. J?rgen can probably explain better
the situation around libdxfrw and Even the second option in OGR (or the
devs who did the driver).

Greetings,
Andreas

Hi Matteo,

did you import via drag-and-drop from the Browser or did you use use the 
dedicated Project ? Import/Export ? Import Layers from DWG/DXF tool?

Hi Matteo,

libdxfrw doesn't support this version yet.
There's an open PR for libdxfrw for importing newer versions:

  https://github.com/LibreCAD/libdxfrw/pull/63

You might be able to manually patch it if you are adventurous

change anything?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Inconsistencies in QGIS ini path
Message-ID: <41e3906f-4d5f-208b-ca05-46878e47ca76@wheregroup.com>

Hi folks,

no idea if this will magically get threaded correctly into the old 
thread, here is the context: 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2020-August/062018.html

In 2020 Tim had discovered that on MacOS the QGIS3.ini was placed within 
a directory called "qgis.org" within the profile.
On Windows and Linux it is placed in a directory called "QGIS" instead.

MacOS: /path/to/QGIS/profiles/someprofile/qgis.org/QGIS3.ini
Linux, Windows: /path/to/QGIS/profiles/someprofile/QGIS/QGIS3.ini

This would mean that QGIS profiles are not portable between these 
operating systems. Unless QGIS always looks in both of those directories.

Sadly the thread ended without any conclusion or solution.

Is this still the case on MacOS or was it a temporary bug? If it still 
the case on MacOS, is there a good reason or is it a bug?


Cheers
Hannes

Hi Francisco,

I show in detail how to set up basic Apache authentication for QGIS Server
(using a Python plugin) in this post:

https://geotux.tuxfamily.org/2019/05/07/accediendo-a-datos-de-qgis-server-con-base-en-roles-de-usuario/


The post is in Spanish and is based on Windows, you would need to
find analogue configurations for Apache in the operating system you're
using, which should be doable.

I hope it helps.


Regards,

Germ?n

Hello to everyone.

My name is Selma, and I'd like to introduce myself as a QGIS funded
Documentation Writer. I have a background in geography and GIS, and I've
been using QGIS for a while, so I'm excited to contribute to this project
and community.
My intention is to send you a report every Friday to let you know about the
most recent contribution I made. I hope you all agree with me; if not,
please let me know, and if you have any suggestions, please send them to me.

For now I have set up my environment and I will start with User Manual and
Training Manual and hopefully next Friday I will send you a report with all
changes and updates that I made for the week.

I think QGIS to be a really essential and truly fantastic project, and I'm
thrilled to be a part of it.

Kind regards,
Selma.

Glad to hear about you!

We missed you in the fantastic session on writing documentation during the onboarding day (last contributor meeting ? ?s-Hertogenbosch).
Hopefully you will be organizing some more ?

All the best!

Hello to everyone.

My name is Selma, and I'd like to introduce myself as a QGIS funded Documentation Writer. I have a background in geography and GIS, and I've been using QGIS for a while, so I'm excited to contribute to this project and community.
My intention is to send you a report every Friday to let you know about the most recent contribution I made. I hope you all agree with me; if not, please let me know, and if you have any suggestions, please send them to me.

For now I have set up my environment and I will start with User Manual and Training Manual and hopefully next Friday I will send you a report with all changes and updates that I made for the week.

I think QGIS to be a really essential and truly fantastic project, and I'm thrilled to be a part of it.

Kind regards,
Selma.

Hi Gabriele,

WGS84 is not a projection, it's an ellipsoid - a mathematical model of the
Earth. You are probably talking about the so-called "Plate carr?e"
projection where latitudes and longitudes are mapped as X and Y values.
And this is a complicated thing because dX is different from dY (meridians
are ellipses and parallels are circles).

I would suggest contacting a consultant who is specialized in this area to
point you in the right direction for your custom need.
I can recommend my colleague Dra?en Tuti?, he is a professional in this
area and did a lot of programming in the context of mapping and projections.
You can see some of his work on
https://www.north2south.eu/map-projections-and-coordinate-reference-systems/

You can contact him via:

To be pedantic (a virtue :-), WGS84 is a family of specifications,,
which define not only the ellipsoid (same for all in the family,
thankfully), but also the position/orientation of coordinates and a
definition of orthometric height.  Included in this, perhaps implicitly
since it is not really about a particular datum, is transforming from
XYZ to LLh.  But, agreed that this list of components does not include a
projection to the plane.

The OP probably meant to say that the data is in the WGS84 Coordinate
Reference System, or that the project projection is WGS84 Web Mercator.

(I agree that the OP appears to need a consultant.)

You want to draw a complex poligon in your application, so how are the points of the poligon defined, what datum etc.
There are many utilities to convert from one datum to another, or libraries you could build into your application.

Message-ID: <64BE14D00200004F0006BA80@ss15apgw01>

Hello,

the current Version of QGIS is using Ghostscript-files which are severe vulnerabilities. 
It is using the Version 9.55.0.


It would be recommended to release a new version of QGIS with the current version of ghostscript to close the security gap.

Thank you in advance!

Thank you all for your kind response. I read about the last contributor
meeting - looks like a great event, hope to be part of future ones.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] pyqt5-sip version for building QGIS
Message-ID: <feff8507-d8c5-4bc6-9f86-c9ed477edffe@mail.shortwave.com>

Hello all,

Can anyone tell me what's the version of PyQt5-sip are we building QGIS?

At conda-forge we are facing a strange bug with QGIS builds in several plataforms that is not affecting OSGeo builds:

https://github.com/conda-forge/qgis-feedstock/issues/346 <https://github.com/conda-forge/qgis-feedstock/issues/346>

We think it might be related to the old version of PyQt5-sip being used (12.11.0) during the builds compared with the SIP version used in run time. Can anyone confirm what version of pyqt5-sip is being used in OSGeo4w builds?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi Alexandre,

as far as I can see OSGeo4W uses pyqt5-sip 12.8.1.

Hi Alessandro,

thank you for this feature, and now that's implemented I can better track
bugs.
Now that's been implemented in QGIS for the GPKG layers and is working
well, can we extend this feature to SpatiaLite and raw "SQLite" layers too,
all of these are based on SQLite DB?
Should this be a QGIS feature request or a GDAL feature request?

I just figured out it already works, I've had layers with identical layers
names in all three data sources so I thought it was from the same layer...
Sorry.

Message-ID: <CA+uFzhiidtBSkifuZp+e0cSKE0bw6k+9yeMjXe9=qD-O-Zr2-A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello!

Our customer reported a bug in the vertex tool when snapping on a segment
with the geometry precision enabled (
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/49311). After some studying, I thought
I found the cause and also a smooth fix for it.

So now I have a bug fix and also a test function that fails without my fix.
Shall I make a pull request or what is the best way to proceed? I decided
to ask here first because I have never made changes to the source code of
QGIS earlier. I have quite a long experience with C++ and Qt. I have read
the developers guide too. (And noticed that it is recommended to report
here first when fixing the bug but now I wasn?t sure at all if I can fix
anything.)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Documentation Writer - Report
Message-ID: <CALarpe6iKCC5x5sbvSBeSkzkHQVjdDqwOBrnSu30+xrKCxwShg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone, hope you are doing fine.

As I already inform you, every Friday I will send you a report where I will
explain what I have been working on.

This week I created a couple of changes in this order:

1. Changes created in chapter 5. Getting Started related to issue #3922 -
missing screenshots
( Tim reviewed and merged this PR)

2. Changes created in chapter 6. Working with Project files

   - *section 6.1.* Oracle database was not mentioned so I added that.
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8410
   - *section 6.3*. Sentence: "Georeferencing the image is possible" in the
   generating output section was a bit confusing in my opinion so I changed it
   to "Including georeference information is possible..."
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8411

3. Changes created in chapter 7. QGIS GUI

   - *subsection 7.1.1.* Project menu also missed Oracle infos
   https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8412
   - *subsection 7.1.2.* note that Edit menu options are available when
   Editing mode in ON https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/8413


Those are my changes for now, the goal is to dig deep into documentation
and fix or update everything from smallest issues to bigger ones. Also, I'm
getting familiar with the writing style that Harrissou uses when he is
writing documentation so I can follow that exacte style and keep
documentation in one tone.
