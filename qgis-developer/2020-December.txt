Hello Andrea,

You were right! Amazing. This fixed the performance issues!

Hi Dimitris, 

Interesting, thanks for confirming. 

It is not the first time I hear that the Browser Panel is slowing down
QGIS too much (even bringing it to a halt almost). 

Now it would be interesting to find out, what, in the browser in your
situation is the culprit. Is it network drives, databases, services? My
first guess would be the network drives. 

This is kind of problematic, as the QGIS devs are more and more
promoting usage of the browser panel (and it is quite useful and
comfortable), but if it is a potential source of slow down ... I don't
know if it is so wise to promote the browser so much. Or at least we
should be more conservative on scanning folders by default.

Hi Andreas,

As a user, I wonder (out loud) if the Browser Panel should be hidden by 
default, in future QGIS versions.  This would avoid this common issue of 
slowing down QGIS for new users, and give the new user a guaranteed 
positive QIGS first-use experience.  Has there been any discussion on 
this possibility?  I was surprised to read here that it is the opposite 
case, where devs are promoting use of the browser panel more and more.

I just thought that I'd share my longtime-user opinion, and hopefully 
not sound too negative.  I just feel disabling the browser panel by 
default would prevent so many issues for new users (and the advanced 
users can turn it on for their use when they need it).  So, benefit the 
new users, and cause the devs an extra button click to enable :)

Related: when I give QGIS training, it is the first thing I instruct, to 
close the browser panel as it causes network issues often.

thanks,

-jeff

I think it would better spent looking into why and fixing that and not just
bidding it and removing quite good feature we want people to use if we
can.  The browser is quite powerful and bidding it by default would be a
bit of a shame.

Suspect we might just have to get creative with how to handle the file
loading, they should already be done in background threads but maybe
something more is needed

IMO this is not an option, the only option I see is to fix the slow
loading times and possibly move the directory scan for non-local
folders to a separate thread in case it is not yet the case.

Fyi the browser tree is not only used in the browser panel but also in
the data source select dialog and in other places too.

Kind regards

Could others test whether hiding network drives from the Browser bypasses
this issue?

I followed Richard Duivenvoorde's suggestion to "Hide from Browser" option
(see [0]), with the following exception: one of the network drives was not
even visible in the Browser Panel to right-click on, but it was being
"scanned" by QGIS. I had to open QGIS3.ini and manually add it as a value
to the key [browser]/hiddenPaths=. Now, I can use the Browser panel without

I had the OneDrive connected in the browser. This was making it impossible
to work with QGIS. After removing it things went back to normal.

I had an issue with slow down and somehow my QGIS ini file has grown very large.  I created a new profile and that fixed the issue.  I don't know what caused the ini file to grown in size.

I followed Richard Duivenvoorde's suggestion to "Hide from Browser" option (see [0]), with the following exception: one of the network drives was not even visible in the Browser Panel to right-click on, but it was being "scanned" by QGIS. I had to open QGIS3.ini and manually add it as a value to the key [browser]/hiddenPaths=. Now, I can use the Browser panel without QGIS freezing for 30 seconds every 2 minutes!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS disables plugin on loading problem
Message-ID: <CAGKduJ1jjEkGCqhRd13UY-HBPF9jnM8GyFERVrcUzH5euSzw3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

by default behavoiur, QGIS disables plugin when there's a loading problem
with it.

In a corporate environment, we have custom plugins that are loaded for a
shared local network folder. If the network is down and one user loads
QGIS, it disables the plugin loaded from the local network now and in the
future.

Is there any way to disable this behaviour? (QGIS 2 doesn't do it).

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] ssl module in Python is not available
Message-ID: <1606998324743-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi list,
it's been some time that on windows machines when I try to do `python -m pip
install xxx` with the included python I get an error that "pip is configured
with locations that require TLS/SSL, however the ssl module in Python is not
available." so I cannot have my plugins automatically install their
dependencies.

On older installations (qgis 3.6 or 3.8) I did not have that issue.
Has something changed on our packaged python or is it a windows thing?

Regards,
Stefanos

[bump]

I've seen in the windows version of QGIS3.ini that in the [Plugins] section
there are watchdogs:

watchdog/PLUGINNAME=true or false

what is the purpose of these watchdogs? There's no documentation about it.

I guess it's like a watchdog to see which plugin that probably makes QGIS
crash. If there is a plugin like that, QGIS tries to help the user by
disabling it. CMIIW.

Hi,
I am doing the same thing with no issues by setting QGIS_PLUGINPATH to a
shared network path. Users connect to the network via VPN and the plugin is
loaded automatically. If the VPN is down while QGIS is starting, the plugin
is not loaded, but connecting to the VPN and restarting QGIS brings
everything to normal.

Strange. Not happening here: at following startups the plugin is never
re-enabled. I must re-enable it from the plugin list.

Message-ID: <CABmHEK3BtRneOFOGmwvZVJrZOMw+dzbQJD9p55F0tm-OJk7jtg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Folks!

I noticed that there might be a problem with QGIS plugin repository while
uploading plugins. I tried to add a new version to a plugin (FMI2QGIS
<https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/FMI2QGIS/>) first via qgis-plugin-ci
<https://github.com/opengisch/qgis-plugin-ci> and then manually on web
page, but both methods failed with error messages:

<Fault 1: "File upload must be a valid QGIS Python plugin compressed
archive. For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory">

and

 "There were errors reding plugin package (please check also your plugin's
metadata). For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory".

I double checked the metadata.txt file and made sure that there were no
.git -directory in the zip file but still the problem persisted. I even
tried to upload the previous version again with a different version number
to see if the problem might lie in the plugin upload process instead and I
couldn't upload that one either.

Thanks!

Hi Joona,

Can you share a link to your zip file? It would help to see the exact
contents you are trying to upload.

Hi Jorge!

Thanks for the fast reply! Here

is a link to the zip file I tried originally (version 0.1.1) and here
<https://github.com/GispoCoding/FMI2QGIS/releases/download/0.1.0/FMI2QGIS.0.1.0.zip>
is a link to the initial release zip file (version 0.1.0) that I uploaded
successfully on 1st December.

I just experienced the same issue a few minutes ago and it went back
to normal.
I thought it was thanks to a requirements.txt file removal, but I guess it
was a server issue.

Hi Joona,

I'm not sure if the problem was solved on the server side. I'm still
getting this "For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git'
directory" error with your plugin.

Can you do one more test, please? Remove these .gitignore files and
upload it again.

./resources/i18n/.gitignore
./resources/.gitignore
./resources/icons/.gitignore
./resources/ui/.gitignore
./logs/.gitignore

Good luck!

Jorge

Hi Jorge!

I removed those .gitignore files and tried again, but the problem persists.

Hi Joona,
are you sure you removed all the 5 .gitignore files from the zip file?

You can validate the zip file content using the code at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/blob/master/qgis-app/plugins/validator.py

I tested your FMI2QGIS.0.1.1.zip and it generates:
For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory
For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory
For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory
For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory
For security reasons, zip file cannot contain '.git' directory

while removing all the 5 .gitignore files from the same zip file it doesn't
generate any error.

Regards.

Andrea

Hi!

Thank you! I checked and I forgot to remove one of the .gitignore files
there. I removed that and I managed to upload a new version just fine! This
is strange since .gitignore files have not caused these kinds of problems
before but I guess it is not too much of a work to export-ignore or remove
those files before making a release.

Indeed, this check has been added last week about the `.git` *directory*.
The `.gitignore` mustn't have raised this error.

I will report this information.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 3D view broken in 3.16 /BUG
Message-ID: <CAO1MNmX1wqaxXB2mY4fTpX23OKFNqQ42RCuokjTxC9S=SfjyyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!
Version 3.16 broke the 3D view capability on my Windows 10 Pro laptop.
I suspect some graphics hardware/driver issue and would like some aid in
troubleshooting.
The machine is an HP ProBook 4530s with built-in graphics that has served
me well since 2011 on all kinds of software. Up to version 3.14 all was
well with the QGIS 3D.
Now the 3D view opens, but the display is off in scale and zoom, and cannot
be rotated. Trying to, I get only sluggish overlapping copies of the
original viewport.
Has there been some significant change in the visualisation libraries, or
anything else that might have an impact on this?
The graphics card driver is labeled Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000, dated
2016-05-19, version 9.17.10.4459 and provided by Intel Corporation. I have
not been able to find an update.
Please advise.
Regards,
--

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Point cloud renderer: tile borders visible?
Message-ID: <b3669f76527d665f324f3f47d63aeb37@carto.net>

Hi, 

When testing the 2D point cloud renderer I noticed that in certain
scales / zoom levels one can clearly see point cloud tile borders: 

see screenshot at
https://www.carto.net/neumann/temp/point_cloud_artefacts.png 

There seem to be different densities involved in certain regions here,
but clearly they correspond to tile borders. 

Is this an expected artefact? Can this be avoided? 

When I zoom in or out, these artefacts seem to disappear. 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas

I know the thread's a few days old now, but maybe it's worth mentioning
that I see the opposite problem - i.e. plugins loading when they are
supposed to be disabled.

For example, I think it is QAD that loads (toolbars and all), even if it is
disabled in the plugin manager.

There are other plugins that do the same thing, and it is particularly
annoying if they are and producing errors for whatever reason.  QGIS
continues to try to load them at every startup - it doesn't seem possible
to disable them, only to uninstall them.

At least some plugins (crayfish I think was the one where I noticed it)
produce errors if they are installed but not supported by your QGIS
version, even though they don't claim to be supported.  i.e. crayfish (I
think) claims to require QGIS 3.13, but if you have it installed and you
start QGIS 3.12 for some reason that still tries to load crayfish, and
produces an error.  Surely QGIS should ignore the plugin if it doesn't
claim to be compatible it, or at most show a notification about it,
instead  of erroring

These behaviours make me think there is something wrong with the way QGIS
loads plugins, but may they are normal.  Do they indicate problems with the
plugin, not with QGIS?

Regards,
Alister

Hi Andreas

The artifacts you are seeing are caused by the fact how the Entwine tool
works in the default configuration. When creating the octree index of point
cloud data, points are organized in a hierarchy of nodes (each containing
usually tens of thousands of points), with each level of the hierarchy
having smaller bounding volume and higher density. One optimization that
Entwine does is that if child nodes contain a small amount of points, they
get merged into the parent node in the hierarchy - in the hope this will
lower the number of nodes and therefore also the number of requests that
need to be done. See Entwine configuration [1] for more details -
especially the options like minNodeSize, maxNodeSize, overflowDepth,
overflowThreshold. So the artifacts could be simply fixed by reindexing the
dataset with modified configuration.

All that said, maybe none of that is necessary:
1. I would suggest lowering "Maximum error" in Layer styling to e.g. 0.5 mm
or even 0.3 mm (assuming the default point size of 1mm) - this should be
giving you a rendering result with very little holes - it is much nicer to
look at and the artifacts should be gone at all scales  (it will increase
the rendering time, but I think it is worth it and I think we should lower
the default maximum error - the higher maximum error was initially used
mainly as a debugging tool for us to see if the point spacing in the
rendered map matches the expectations)
2. For indexing of point clouds, we will be internally using Untwine [2] -
a newer approach (also coming from friends at Hobu!) that has different
configuration and probably won't be showing these artifacts. Peter is
currently working on the integration [3]

Martin

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the explanation.

I confirm that reducing the maximum error helps to remove the artefacts.
WIth 0.5 mm I could still see them at one particular zoom level, but with
0.4 mm it was completely gone.

Thanks a lot,
Andreas

Hi,

I wonder how I can achieve the elevation slicing / filtering shown here:

https://twitter.com/nyalldawson/status/1331092360818614274?s=20

Is there Python code involved to do that? No GUI yet?

That slicing looks incredibly useful to me.

I know I could change the min/max values and clip them in the symbology
settings, but that isn't very interactive.

Thanks,
Andreas

In https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/40504 I've changed the default to 0.3.

Thanks for the feedback!

No GUI yet (see below). Try the following Python code:


w=QgsFloatingWidget(iface.mainWindow())
l=QVBoxLayout()
slider = QgsRangeSlider(Qt.Vertical)
slider.setFlippedDirection(True)

range = QgsElevationUtils.calculateZRangeForProject(QgsProject.instance())
slider.setRangeLimits(range.lower() * 100,range.upper()*100)
l.addWidget(slider)
w.setSizePolicy( QSizePolicy.Fixed, QSizePolicy.Preferred)
w.setFixedSize(500,200)
w.setLayout(l)
w.setAnchorWidget(iface.mapCanvas())
w.setAnchorPoint(QgsFloatingWidget.TopLeft)
w.setAnchorWidgetPoint(QgsFloatingWidget.TopLeft)
w.show()
w.raise_()

def range_changed(lower,upper):
    iface.mapCanvas().setZRange(QgsDoubleRange(lower/100,upper/100))

slider.rangeChanged.connect(range_changed)

> That slicing looks incredibly useful to me.

I've been struggling with how to expose this to users, which is why
it's all just python code for now. I'm also starting to think I need
to make the api a bit more generic and potentially allow for slicing
based on any kind of attribute, not just elevation/z based slicing.
There's potentially many different variables which users may want to
interactively slice using and I'm leaning toward reworking the api to
allow for more flexibility, including allowing multiple different
range definition for layers. E.g. you could have a vector point layer
with both a "z" attribute and a "concentration" attribute, and we
could expose sliders for filtering on both the z AND concentration
ranges...

Something to think more about :)

Hi all,

I just saw that the backport label for 3.16 has been disabled saying it's
broken.
It's a bit strange to me that 3.10 works but not 3.16.

Anybody has more information?

Looking at discussions on the ML, they are quite old and don't seem related
to the recent disabling of the label.

Cheers,
Denis

Thank you Nyall.

With your Python code I got the slider - and it works fine - Thank you!

Regarding the discussion around such a slider: next to slicing different
attributes there is also the question if this should be per layer or global
per project for all layers. Plenty of options and use cases here.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Denis,

This one for instance has failed https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/40323

Only one commit has been cherry-picked instead of 3, I don't know why!

Hope it helps.

Julien

Yes - - I renamed the label because the bot was completely broken for
the 3.16 branch. Everything would report a fail to backport even
though the commits would cleanly apply to the branch (Eg
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/40403#issuecomment-739581704). I got
sick of having to always manually backport myself so renamed to label
to push that responsibility back onto the original submitters.

Interesting, we use the exact same backport GithubAction version 
(v1.0.26) for MapServer, and I haven't experienced any issues recently. 
  But will keep an eye open!

Message-ID: <CAC7zN94kkODOo7WCTsM+briuAETTTagsFg0+ypE0LbcPa-MhRQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

PSI: There is a QGIS Enhancement Proposal (QEP) for "buffered transactional
editing", which will add a new mode for editing with better transaction
integration on the backend and editing data models instead of isolated
layers. This all while keeping a local edit buffer.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/203

If someone wants to give feedback on it, happy to answer questions or
discuss details.

Hello,

Seems support for PostgreSQL 12 has been added to QtSQL 5.14 : 
https://codereview.qt-project.org/c/qt/qtbase/+/277205

Concerning Ubuntu, seems Qt 5.14 is available in Ubuntu groovy 20.10, 
but for dev purpose we could always find a workaround.

On the other hand, final users mostly use QGIS on Windows, some of them 
use plugins base on QtSQL and this is blocking them from upgrading to 
PostgreSQL 12.

I have no visibility on the available Qt version in next QGIS version 
for Windows.

Is it possible we get Qt >= 5.14 in next QGIS version for Windows ?

I'm working on (well - actually working on getting back to work on) the OSGeo4W
reboot.  It'll have Qt 5.15 along with a lot of other updates - and less if any
of the cruft.  Essentially everything is inplace except for QGIS itself (but
that didn't change in the last few weeks?).

Hi

I just checked the roadmap page (
https://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html) and it seems
we are approaching the end of days of QGIS in February with the release
3.18.0.
Do I interpret this correctly that QGIS is now officially feature complete
and does not require any more releases?

Thanks :-)

Dear community,
what great news to finish the week with,
Google as part of their involvement in the Open-Source Security Foundation
(OpenSSF) has devised the "Criticality Score" as a means of judging crucial
open-source projects [3].

and guess what, QGIS is in the top 10 for the C++ most critical projects,
along with projects like Tensorflow, Ceph, Bitcoin and Electron. In the C
category, you've projects like Git ant the Linux kernel, OpenSSL... [1][2]

What to I say besides wow and thanks a lot to every single community member
involved in this amazing project!

you (and QGIS) rock!

Cheers Marco

Does QGIS read e-mail

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] [RHEL][QGIS Server] Installation questions and
 advices
Message-ID: <CAM+zXj3Jh2bKcETT_ewatAYz+oG4-XaLgoMBZpGsqnYMFqciQg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear devs,
I hope you are fine.

Recently the IT department of my company asked me if it's possible to
install the latest QGIS Server version in RHEL 8.3.

So I did a little research.

Apparently, RHEL 8.3 is based on Fedora 29[1]. In this last RHEL 8.3, the
technical notes said that they adapted dnf manager [2] as default for this
and next RHEL releases. I was excited and went to Dani QGIS fedora repo to
install in RHEL but the latest builds are based in recent Fedora releases.
It's possible to have QGIS servers recent builds of Fedora in an RHEL based
on an old Fedora release?

So I think as well in Docker as an alternative inside RHEL but
apparently, they will not support officially docker in the future starting
in this release 8.3 [3] and they will switch to podman, is possible to
change but have a limitation for know don't have a tool equal to
docker-compose (there is a workaround[4,5,6]). It's possible to install
Docker but won't by supported official for RHEL [7].

In the end, I can always try to convince them to use other types of Linux
distro server such as ubuntu server ou fedora server, what do you think?

Based on these thoughts what kind of path can I follow? Please correct me

Hi,

I don't know podman but looking at the links you provided, it seems
like podman is compatible with docker containers.

You can try that.

Regards.

Hi Jo?o,

Podman uses containerd directly and will certainly work as a replacement to run docker containers.

>> is possible to change but have a limitation for know don't have a tool equal to docker-compose (there is a workaround[4,5,6])

If you only run one pod of QGIS Server, you don?t need to use docker-compose, just run podman directly as alias for docker command. If for some reason you need to use docker-compose because you want to deploy several services, I suggest you re-wrote the services as kubernetes manifests. The article you linked shows how to migrate from docker-compose recipe into a kubernetes manifests using kompose, but you still need to validate the resulting YAML by hand. I also use this approach to create helm charts to deploy QGIS Server to kubernetes.

If you intend to run it as production container in RHEL, I think you should also consider making the QGIS Server image as a security-hardened image that can pass CIS benchmark.

Dear Alessandro and Rizky,
sorry for my delay in the answer. Many thanks for sharing your feedback.

After your feedback, I found that are implementing as well an alternative
for docker-compose compatible with podman.

https://github.com/containers/podman-compose

So I think is good news as well.

Once again thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Jo?o Gaspar

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] skip some dialogs?
Message-ID: <e70301b0-9fc1-6392-4a4a-dc02a7a73a25@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

Currently I'm creating some algorithm (web based) which creates a (multigeom typed) geojson in my /tmp dir.
To quickly check the result I want QGIS to start up and show me the result,
AND I want to be able to quickly stop QGIS.

Two dialogs now are in my way:
1) QGIS always stops and asks me which 2 or 3 types (of layers) I want to load from the geojson: ALL 
2) when quitting QGIS always asks me 'there are files in the /tmp dir, are you sure....' YES

So I would be very happy if I could have(create) two booleans:

- ask_for_specific_sublayers (defaulting to True (current behaviour), but optionally False)
- ask_for_tmp_files (defaulting to True (current behaviour), but optionally False)

Easiest maybe would be to create those as Settings params (so only settable via the Advanced tab)?

Questions:
- would this be helpful for others? Then maybe add it as user option in the Options dialog?
- am I missing an option (which is already there)
- anybody seeing any problems (for me in implementation)?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Argh, I should have know: yes off course. There is already a
"askToSaveMemoryLayers" 
which you can set to False in the Advanced Settings...
(layers in /tmp are considered temporal (as in not saved in stable place) layers)

So question would be for this: is this enough or should this one show up in gui?

Richard

Hi,

I want to export as a RGBA GeoTIFF a raster to which I have applied a symbology but I can't find how to do it in Python. I want the same result as when I right-click on my layer, click Export -> Save As... and check Rendered image instead of Raw data. The GDAL tool PCT to RGB exist but is less flexible and, in my case, just crash with my layer. I didn't find a methods for doing this with a QgsMapLayer.

Thanks a lot

Message-ID: <e977747c9a2a03730138c91e2a3916bd@runbox.com>

Hi everyone,

I am trying to add a menu item in the "View" menu but I am missing something.

I added the action in "qgisapp.ui" but I also need to edit "ui_qgisapp.h" to enable the action in the menu. However, it looks like ui "ui_qgisapp.h" is a file generated when building the application. So this particular menu item is added locally on my machine but making a PR with that new feature I am developping would miss the menu item.

What's the correct way to add a menu item in this context?

Hi,
you need to modify src/ui/qgisapp.ui with qt creator or qt designer.
Just note that the 'view' menu is a bit overcrowded and barely fits in one
column on older 1366x768 displays. We should consider grouping some actions
in sub-menus in 'view' and 'edit' menus.

Hello Marco,

Can you please clarify if after the nomination period there will be a
voting period, or it's a one step process (nomination/voting)

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Is there a updated place where we can see who got elected in 2019 and 2020?

Thanks,

this is the 2020 election. the elected candidates match the usergroups that
formed in 2020 and will be allowed to vote in the 2021 AGM.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Nominatim integration in QGIS
Message-ID: <CAC_qv=oRkR1UYCGuwshdBb5Th5D7qbQj=wjk29NPSoEsjOWwKg@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

FYI, I?ve just opened a PR[1] integrating the Nominatim geocoder into QGIS
through a dedicated locator filter and an algorithm to do batch geocoding.
The Nominatim?s endpoint used is the one run by the OpenStreetMap
Foundation (OSMF).

Throughout the development of these features, steps were taken to ensure
the integration  adheres to the OSMF usage policy. This meant:
- Adding a mechanism to our locator filters to delay fetching of results to
avoid ?auto completion? queries at every keystroke;
- Throttling the number of queries made to OSMF? endpoint to one request
per second;
- Insuring fair visibility/acknowledgment of the origin and license of the
fetched data;
- Zero-effort: our network access manager already insures a
QGIS-identifiable User-Agent, required by OSMF.

Marco, in striving to be the best possible open source citizen, I think it
would be good to send a formal request seeking permission from OSMF to go
ahead and merge these features. Would it be possible for you, as chair of
the QGIS.org association, to send an email to the OSMF/Nominatim folks on
this?

Best,

Mathieu Pellerin

Hi list,

Just wondering if anyone has an update on the latest patch releases --
according to the roadmap 3.16.2/3.10.13 should have been tagged last Friday.

Is there any blockage here that I can assist with?

Message-ID: <7e59afc6-24e6-4463-c729-a106f8d9e2ca@gmail.com>

Hi all,

recently I opened an issue because of a strange behavior of GdalUtils in 
QGIS 3.17 vs QGIS 3.10 [0]

I really think GdalUtils is an extremely useful module we have in QGIS 
and that we can call in python.

Someone else has experienced some recent strange behavior?

Cheers and thanks

Matteo

issue aside, you really shouldn't be relying on this class in any 3rd
party code. It's private Processing api, and could be removed or
changed at any time.

yep that's exactly where I'm using it. I'm developing some Processing 
scripts (as a plugin) and I discovered this bug when using the 
Processing plugin in 3.10 and master

Thanks for the clarification

That's still abusing private api though -- the ONLY code which should
be importing and using this module is stuff which resides in QGIS
master.

If you find it useful, you should copy this class inside your plugin
and always use your internal copy, so that you're not risking breakage
if the api of that class is ever changed in future releases.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] stale bot :-(
Message-ID: <5a879612-cf89-b5eb-45c3-f3b28bd15d5a@duif.net>

I received some "this issue will be closed because of lack of feedback",
but I think current 'stale bot implementation' is a little rude on the edges.

(did I miss some discussion about this here?)

I received some "this issue will be closed because of lack of feedback", only because I commented on them. But some are just plain valid:

As an example:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/39107#issuecomment-749298135
that is just a valid use-case (or maybe feature request?)

This one:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37984
is just valid (I even installed Oracle to check this...)

This one: also valid and still needed:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/issues/37956

Weeding the issues is not nice, so removing non-valid, old or non responding is fine, but now I think the bot is pulling the veggies instead of the weed :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

Sorry if it was a bit a rough start!
The stale bot specifically picks only issues which are left with the
"feedback" label.
This was the case with these two issues. I notice Giovanni already fixed
this.

The assumption is that the veggies don't have open questions on them and
this way we can filter the weed. Does that sound reasonable to you?

Best regards
Matthias

Hello,

could you tell me what is considered weed? In most cases I can't provide 
sample data because I do not own the data or a coworker had the crash 
and "only" saved the report details.

In the "QGIS unexpectedly ended"-dialog it reads "You can also send us a 
helpful bug report using the Copy Report button and opening a ticket at 
QGIS Issue Tracker." - the thing is, the "copy report"-button only 
activates after some text is inserted into "Tell us something about when 
you got the crash" and without knowing that, you just assume the "copy 
report"-button is broken too and close the dialog. In addition some of 
my workmates can't even read english, they just close the dialog 
immediately. I also noticed that one of my reports was closed because I 
only posted the stacktrace and a short sentence about what my coworker 
was roughly doing as far as he could remember and I couldn't provide 
sample data. So I guess posting the stack trace and a short explanation 
is considered weed and not a "helpful bug report"?

Could you add more information to the "QGIS unexpectedly ended"-dialog, 
so it is easier for you to pinpoint the issue without having the user to 
create sample data, a sample project, a new user profile? That would be 
my wish for christmas.

There was some initial glitch, but I think Matthias already fixed it.
And to answer Richard: each ticket that will be labeled as stale will
be manually reviewed (by me for sure) and if it needs to stay open
(and the feedback label removed) it will.

This bot was added because we **need** to keep the bug queue cleaner
that it is now.

cheers

This one slipped through the cracks of a notoriously understaffed pull
request review team. Sorry for that. I just reopened it, since it looks
reasonable.
If you run into this again, please ask what can be done to continue with
the pull request, a comment will show your interest, likely attract
reviewers - and also snooze the stale bot.

That sounds ideal, but unfortunately things just don't work that way.
If your bug report is not reproducible there's a very low chance it
will get fixed.

So if you want your bug fixed, the motivation sits with you to make it
as easy as possible for the bug triaging team/developers to reproduce.
Honestly, if we (developers) can't reproduce a bug in <5 minutes,
we'll just move to the next ticket in the queue and you've missed your
chance at a fix...

And that's exactly what stale bot and the feedback tag is designed to
assist with -- it helps push the responsibility back to the bug
submitter to make sure there's sufficient detail and a reproducible
test case in the ticket. It's actually in place to avoid frustration
caused by the "I submitted this ticket 12 months ago, why has nothing
been done?!?!?" situation.

To be honest, I always find these stale bots more frustrating:

"I submitted this ticket 2 months ago, why was it closed?"

Hey, the OSGeo wiki/LDAP integration ticket survived open
for 13 years, and it's finally being worked on !

That's why the bot has a very descriptive message, giving the
submitter the answer to this question in advance ;)

Hi, 

Since a few days I get hundreds of e-mails every day from github closing
issues due to lack of feedback? Does it make sense to spam all
contributors with such messages with basically no useful content? I
know, one can write an email filter, but ... 

I also think that 14 days is a too short time to wait for feedback.
People might be on holidays or busy with other stuff. Closing issues in
such a short time seems really rude. One month seems more appropriate to
me. 

Anything we can do here? Who is in charge of the github settings? 

Thank you and greetings, 

Andreas

Hi Andreas,

The overall time is normally 21 days (someone asks a question, sets it to
"feedback", after 14 days you get a heads up, 7 days later it will be
closed). Even after this period valid issues can be reopened.

Nevertheless, I have increased the 7 days to 28 days now, leaving a total
of at least 42 days between the feedback label and closure. to make sure
people have enough time in the current ramp up phase to go through the
notifications and remove the "feedback" label where appropriate. After the
initial cleaning now and in "production mode" we will want to go back to
the previous solution of 21 days between feedback and close.

Sidenote, I'd be surprised to see that you have received "hundreds" of
mails, this was limited to a subselection of 83 issues flagged as stale up
to now :-)

Hi Matthias, 

Thanks for the increase of the interval. 

Yes, I might have exaggerated a bit with "hundreds". I will create an
e-mail filter for the future.

Hi Andreas

Meanwhile, if you can spare some time to go through them and remove the
"feedback" flag where it was left for no reason, that will help to separate
the good from the bad.

Thanks

Dear all,

While I am very fond of mobile QGIS versions like QField and Input, I am wondering if anyone in the QGIS community is having an eye on emerging mobile Linux solutions using Phosh, Lomiri, Plasma mobile on devices like PinePhone[1], PineTab[2] or Librem5[3]? Anyone who tried it out or even developed in that direction?

Though maybe still not fully production ready yet, this looks very interesting ...

Happy new year.

Cheers
Stefan

Is this what the label says? :-)   I'm hoping it is not, but... 

I have had some PR's for 3.17 of which are labeled such:

Message-ID: <CAMCJChv6xU9HHABT+a+n=OhsBmtVZUAGpOz2ooyQcerq0iPn5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

After updating from QGIS 3.16.1 to 3.16.2, I can't run GRASS algorithms,
they fail to get outputs.

Downgrading to 3.16.1, everything works fine again.

QGIS 3.16.2 is still shipping GRASS 7.8.4, and I'm thinking if can be some
issue related to that, as 3.16.2 from OSGeo4W is using GRASS 7.8.5 already,
and it seems to work.

Anyone confirm this behaviour?

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Unfortunately it is: you must do it manually (cherry-pick).

Happy new year :)

Hi,
If I may, I still don't get the reason of the relabeling. With its current
name it's no surprising that the action is broken, and we would never know
whether it works if it's not renamed correctly. Also, I know I'm not a dev
and I may miss some subtleties, but it's curious to have the same action
properly work for 3.10 in qgis/QGIS repo [0], have it work in
QGIS-Documentation repo [1] and being completely broken for 3.16 (using the
same pattern)...

[0]

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS build error: multiple definitions of
 sipQgsTinInterpolator:: methods
Message-ID: <CAECJsSrxjYiMt_h9OchK5VFFCyCLPtcfhSBeAiEU5RW6fVtYLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I'm trying to build master and am getting a bunch of error messages related
to multiple definitions of sipQgsTinInterpolator methods. Anyone knows what
I should do?
If necessary, I'm on Ubuntu 20.04.1, python 3.8.5, sip 4.19.21 and I can
build 3.16 fine.

some sample below:

To ALL: same!

Mmm, did something change or was this fixed? 
Now I do not see that label anymore, but I still have 'backport release-3_16' labeled PR's:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Arduivenvoorde+is%3Aclosed+label%3A%22backport+release-3_16%22+

But clicking on one of those in the list above seems that they all worked/merged? Either by Nyall or by bot?
I also checked the 'issues' or 'features' and they are now in 3.16 (also in code)..

Would it be feasible (or looks handy for others) if AFTER a succesfull backport this label maybe became "backportED to release-3_16" or so?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I am currently trying to fix it, that's why I changed it again. I'm waiting
on some additional information at the moment. If everything is fine I hope
to fix it within 24 hours. Otherwise I will (have to) rename the label
again.

Fingers crossed ...
Matthias

Hi,

All systems are back up and running. Backport 3.16 working again.
For pull requests that need backporting, just remove and re-add the label
to trigger it.

At this point a huge thanks to Nyall for backporting some forgotten PRs
over the last weeks and even more for maintaining a delayed backporting
branch for maximum stability of QGIS LTR for the last months continuously!

Matthias

Good idea.
Proposal here https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/40800
It will be set based on the global outcome (i.e. backport 3.10 and 3.16
successful) but that should already help to identify un-backported changes.

Hi Pedro,
have you looked into the Log Messages panel?

Is there something about failed load of grass plugin dll modules?

Regards.

Hi Andrea,

I believe this report is yours, right?
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/655

I can't confirm right now because I've some processes running on Linux in
the same machine (dual boot), but I think that is the issue.

Thank you very much for digging into this.

Best regards,
Pedro

Yes.

QGIS 3.16.2 and QGIS 3.10.13 installers contain GRASS 7.8.4 which needs
gdal300.dll and proj_6_2.dll, but both the dlls are missing.

On the contrary, GRASS 7.8.5 doesn't seem to need them.

Regards.

Andrea

Since we are at more than two weeks of the next point release cycle and it
affects LTR, maybe this needs emergency standalone releases.

What you think J?rgen?

Pedro

Hi Vincent,
Yes this is what I finally did. I was worrying I'd break again my 3d build but everything is OK.

Thanks.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Point cloud renderer: tile borders visible?
Message-ID: <d8f79be31c9f12a9b1fa3890dd6c19d1@carto.net>

Hi, 

When testing the 2D point cloud renderer I noticed that in certain
scales / zoom levels one can clearly see point cloud tile borders: 

There seem to be different densities involved in certain regions here,
but clearly they correspond to tile borders. 

Is this an expected artefact? Can this be avoided? 

When I zoom in or out, these artefacts seem to disappear. 

Thanks and greetings, 

Andreas
