Hi Nyall,

You hit a bug I think. Only staff members see the star (attached).

Besides my own (staff) account I created a zuidt (non staff) account,
and only the staff one sees the button...

Created an issue:
https://github.com/kartoza/projecta/issues/905

So please use the direct url Tim showed:
http://changelog.qgis.org/en/qgis/3.0.0/create-entry/


Regards,

Richard

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS: intermittent failure to detect label buffer
Message-ID: <1525165218692-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

This seems a little odd on QGIS 3.0.2 Win7x64. I am trying to determine
whether a layer's labels have a buffer enabled:



This seems to work intermittently on repetiton. Am I getting something
wrong, or has anyone else seen this behaviour?

Thanks

Tom

I have a vector layer, labelled, with a buffer on the label. I repeatedly run
the following script:

labelling = iface.activeLayer().labeling()
palyr = labelling.settings()
buffer = palyr.format().buffer().enabled()
if buffer:
    print("buffer")
else:
    print("no buffer")

Here's the output:

exec(open('C:/Users/tchadwin/AppData/Local/Temp/tmpjp0zwd85.py'.encode('utf-8')).read())
no buffer

I have never made a pull request to the core QGIS, but I just attempted it.
I don't know if I did everything right and if I didn't please forgive me.
The pull request is #6910. This adds the missing r.fill.stats GRASS
processing description file.

Thanks,

Calvin

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] wfs response paging
Message-ID: <CAFJcOMELhrs_kk7h4MvALZVubxAw8nUB65s8W1bc66eX+HG_ng@mail.gmail.com>

I am testing a wfs (in development) against qgis and wanting to know if
anyone can cue me in as to whether response paging should just work (qgis
v3, wfs v2) when you add a layer exceeding the initial points loaded, or if
you need other techniques to load all features from a wfs into qgis as a
layer.  I see posts over past years on earlier versions that say response
paging does not work in QGIS, one should instead change settings so the
layer loads new points based on the bbox, things like that.

I've done a pretty good job i think of searching documentation, and even
developer posts on the repos so far, so if anyone can describe how qgis
will load a wfs layer with paging and under what circumstances I would
apprecitate it.  (next stop is the code of course.)

Thank you

Yes from QGIS 2.18 WFS paging should work with WFS 2.0 services. Give QGIS
2.18 to ensure it works with your service. Note QGIS 3.0 has a few WFS
issues and bugs that need to be resolved, so I don't recommending using
that version yet.

Cheers
Jeremy

Having an R console within QGIS would be incredibly useful! I've been
copying and pasting between R and QGIS (keeping the WKT field correctly
formatted) using read.table, which works well, too. W.r.t. sp vs. sf, seems
like sf is the future for R spatial objects? Any thoughts on this?

Crowdfunding definitely seems like the way forward - which platforms have
been used for this kind of project in the past?

Warning: QSqlDatabasePrivate::addDatabase: duplicate connection name
'qt_sql_default_connection', old connection removed.
Warning: QSqlDatabasePrivate::addDatabase: duplicate connection name

ERROR 6: EPSG PCS/GCS code 37004 not found in EPSG support files.  Is this

Why is QGIS trying to open the world map file?

I tested to open it and it works, and recognized as a 4326 SRS.

I found the 37004 srs in the projection list. It is in a big list of SRS
named "Imported from GDAL"

Étendue: Étendue inconnue

Proj4: +proj=longlat +ellps=fschr60m +no_defs

Anyone knows what happens here?

Regards,

Régis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] New WEB Suite for QGIS - G3W-SUITE
Message-ID: <8eeca8c2-e592-731e-b857-5d0eec242746@gis3w.it>

Hi users, hi developers,

I am pleasure to introduce you a new suite to publish QGIS projects on 
web by QGIS-Server  that we developed in past 2-3 years at GIS3W.

G3W-SUITE is a modular client-server application developed with Django 
and Vue.js.

Main github repositoryies is https://github.com/g3w-suite

Main Django application (G3W-ADMIN) is 
https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-admin and main webmap client 
applications are

https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-client-sdk,

https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-client-template-lte ,

https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-client

In normal developing workflow, client application is compiled and put 
inside main server Django application.

To run the suite is enough deploy main Django application G3W-ADMIN.

If you want to try it and/or (if you like it :)) partecipate to the 
project you are Welcome!

Comments and suggestions are welcome!

We are a small company, so is possibile we reply to your question with a 
slight delay :)

Bye
W

That's from the CRS selection dialog and can be ignored - see #17549

I'm sure sf is the future for spatial objects. There are not too many  
examples and resources to be found on the web still, but I ported one of  
my (poor scripts) from sp to sf. It's now maybe 25% of code and maybe 10  
times faster.
Though there are numerous packages with dependencies for sp, which will  
not change for a long time.
I have to admit, I never managed to get R code work properly in QGIS  
(documentation?) but stuck to R studio and just did the post-processing  
within QGIS. Having the ability to work properly within QGIS would maybe  
boost the efficiency to a new level.

Hi Walter,

thanks for letting us know !
Any chance to have an english version of the website and some demo / videos
to help us understand that suite?

Hi Régis,

we are pulling up a new demo site, for now you can watch to this dieo, 
is in Italian language but I think is clear.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xq-8tgc66s

Al the best.

Message-ID: <2eb619f3-e6e5-d4f6-cd84-df5701748257@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

compared to 3.0 in QGIS master Processing Modeler there has been added
some useful parameters (Distance, Enum, Matrix, Range) but some old are
missing, like Expression, Raster Band.

Are there any problems related with these 2 parameters?

Cheers

​This project sounds interesting. Some questions:
1) this webgis should run under django ​system?
2) is it extensible (i.e. can I add custom buttons, actions, etc...)?
3) there's a tile caching system. Does it solve the usual problems with
labels?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Compiling QGIS 3 on Centos 7
Message-ID: <4ccbc4cc2cb6fbc4ce6c07bc283152c0@carto.net>

Hi, 

Did someone successfully compile QGIS 3 on Centos 7? 

Or are there any recent QGIS 3 server packages available for Centos 7? I
don't need 3d or desktop on this machine - only server. 

While I can find qt5 packages for centos 7, several other dependencies
are not available, such as the qt5-scintilla packages or qwt for qt5,
etc. 

I would be grateful for any hints or recipes how to install qgis3-server
on centos 7 or compile it myself (meaning getting the necessary
dependencies). 

Or would be a dockerized QGIS 3 server version be easier to install QGIS
server 3 on Centos7? 

Thanks,
Andreas

Interesting news - thank you. Do you have a demo site running the
technology?

I am hoping to revitalise the QGIS Network API plugin project that I
mentored for GSoC last year - it needs porting to QGIS3 and probably some
more documentation.

For anyone who doesn't know it, it makes QGIS expose a network API service
so that clients can call defined QGIS functions. So using the R client API
you can get data from live QGIS layers, or send R spatial objects to QGIS
as new layers.

code: https://gitlab.com/qgisapi
docs: https://qgisapi.gitlab.io/
bugs: plenty

Message-ID: <CACfnYnSnx2mWZ4znzesbQ=gbnH5cBXW7VuypyLQOrfVKyvabzg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I just noticed the following (on both Ubuntu and Window):

clicking "ok" in Processing options dialog generated a python error,
then clicking on "close" generates another one and so on and the only
thing left is killing the program. Does not seems to happen on
2.18.18.

Anyone confirms? If confirmed any chance to make an new point release asap?

thanks in advance

Hmm... it's not that simple unfortunately. The entries are
transparently discarded and not saved if I attempt to create them.

If you've got rights to add them, can you please add:


QGIS: Symbology

"Easy styling of discrete rasters"

"In QGIS 3.0, the existing raster Paletted Renderer for rasters was
adapted to allow for easy styling of discrete raster layers, such as
landcover or boolean rasters. Now, users can select the renamed
"Paletted/Unique Values" renderer and click the "Add Unique Values"
button to load all unique raster values from the layer. These are
automatically assigned a color using the selected color ramp.

The unique value calculation is performed in a background thread to
keep the UI responsive for large (or remote) raster layers.
Additionally, users can manually add individual new classes as
desired, and edit the associated pixel value for any existing class.
Deleting multiple classes at once is also supported, as well as
changing the color, transparency and labels for multiple classes at
once.

Color palettes can be loaded from a text file, with ESRI
clr/GDAL/GRASS color table formats supported. Color palettes can be
saved to a clr text file for sharing."

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Sentry support for QGIS crashes / minidumps
Message-ID: <0BDED527-8AE6-4056-A362-AEFB5E2122FC@kartoza.com>

Hi All


For many years we have used sentry (http://sentry.io) in our python projects to systematically collect, review and prioritise issues raised in our python projects. Sentry.io is open source (plus they offer a commercially hosted service). At Kartoza we run our own instance under docker / rancher.

In the last Nødebo hackfest, we discussed the possibility of using something like Sentry for QGIS so that we could better understand where our users encounter crashes and proactively fix them. I subsequently went and researched whether Sentry.io has support for mini dumps / c++ crash handling and at the time it did not have so I parked thinking about it there.

Yesterday I got a sentry updates newsletter and noticed that they have now added C++  support (currently in beta):

https://blog.sentry.io/2018/04/17/introducing-minidump-support

I know I am not alone when I run training courses offering this advice: “Save your project regularly, QGIS will probably crash at some point”. I really hate saying that but we have never had a systematic way of seeing where QGIS is crashing for our users and fixing this crash points. As we lead up to 3.4 LTR later this year, having good crash metrics and fixing the most common crash points will allow us to have a release that we can be confident works well for our users with out crashing during trivial operations.

Perhaps one of our fine developers might like to pitch this as a QGIS Grant proposal (submission period closes 13 May 2018)?

http://blog.qgis.org/2018/04/15/qgis-grants-3-call-for-grant-proposals-2018/

I’d be happy to help set up our own sentry.io instance on QGIS infrastructure. We could also use that instance to receive tracebacks from the python bits of our code….

Regards

Tim

Thanks Giovanni for checking. This kind of issues, in LTR minor
releases, are particularly undesirable. We had already a few instances
like this. Does anyone have ideas or suggestions on what we can do to
prevent it?
All the best.

It doesn't help 2.18, but unit tests are the fix here. At least in 3.0
the whole of processing core is totally soaked in unit tests.

I'm going to be submitting a grant proposal to start adding gui unit
tests to processing. That's now the most fragile part of the
processing framework.

Hey Tim,

I added a crash handler in 3.0 for Windows at least and it lead to a few
good fixes.  I will checkout the stuff you posted to see if we can
intergrate it into what I already have there.

The system is a CLIENT-SEVER system based on a API REST comunication,

A the moment webgis layout page is served from a django view, but there

Yes is possible to add custom elements in programming way, as I wrote

Inside repository you find a module for chaching: 
https://github.com/g3w-suite/g3w-admin-caching
Is a django module that user Tilestache for caching single layer of a 
QGIS Project.
Is very simple and a the moment solve labels problems with tilestache 
capabilities.

Hi,

Wondering if anybody has Windows7 machines with running QGIS 3.x
installations.

Issue #18794 has problems on a Win7-64 machine and is wondering if it is
that combi that is a problem?

If people installed it on Win7-64 succesfully it should be a local
problem. I already pointed him to:

Hi Nyall,

You added it right, as a staff member I could see the item 'pending',
and I approved it now: it is visible now.

This is an old issue I think where pending items are only visible to
staff members.

So: if anybody does want to do some work, sent me an email, and I make
you staff for this week :-)

Richard

Hi Andreas,

some googling:

https://centos.pkgs.org/7/epel-x86_64/qt5-qtwebkit-5.6.2-1.el7.x86_64.rpm.html

Seems to me 5.6 is the latest easily installable epel package?
Not sure what minimal Qt version is for qgis...
Though: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L297
seems to say 5.9.2 (no 3D off course)

The dockerized version is the also a way to go..

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps I have some OLD(!) compile instructions for QGIS 2(!) on centos7:

Hi Richard, 

Yeah - CentOS7 is currently stuck with qt 5.6 

I probably have to give up on getting QGIS server 3 to run on CentOS7
:-( 

The only way would be a dockerized version of QGIS server 3 - or I can
convince our IT-department to switch to a more modern distro. 

Thanks anyway, 

Andreas

thanks Nyall.

We have anyway a hot potato now to handle: all people that upgraded
recently to the latest and greatest LTR have now the problem they
can't configure Processing and QGIS is left in a state it must be
killed. Is this enough to trigger and emergency new point release? I
would say yes.

Hi again, 

Seems like CentOS 7.5 (release due soon) comes with qt 5.9.2 - just have
to be patient a bit and hope that all other dependencies will also be
more up-to-date. 

As an example, CentOS 7.4 only comes with GDAL 1.11 - they are very
conservative!

I personally haven't but I will comment that Windows 7 is out of 
mainstream support and you can't expect your component suppliers to be 
obligated to continue supporting it. It's like saying Ubuntu Lucid can 
run this version of Qgis and be supported with it. As we all know only 
the more recent editions of Linux can run the latest Qgis software so 
sooner or later a hard reality comes in that Windows as a platform is 
not really different from another platform and that software suppliers 
en mass are busy abandoning support for Windows 7 as we speak.

Hi,

Would be very useful for QGIS server. Good idea!

Having Sentry on a few Python projects, I agree it's a very nice tool to
have for debugging. It shows you new bug, bugs which should be fixed but
occurs again, etc.
It would be nice to have it in QGIS I think.

Hi,

I have no experience with Sentry.

I just gave it a superquick try and it looks interesting indeed.

Since I have no idea how it works exactly and what's possible to do with
it, could you quickly describe how it's working together with other
issue trackers?

Thanks
Matthias

Message-ID: <1e2146c2-59c7-5b4c-0377-8b90bd3c5873@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
the measurements of a EPSG:4326 line appear correct in any SRS, both
with the interactive info tool and writing on the table the value of
$length, *if* the OTF reprojection is active (including 4326).
If it is not, the result is grossly overestimated (298 m instead of 228,
etc.).
Am I missing something, or this is a serious bug?
I attach a tiny sample showing the effect.
Thanks.

Message-ID: <e1f96756-d218-a095-38c7-d8557f662c8c@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I tested several SAGA algorithms within a Modeler. Even with very very
simple models (one layer - one algorithm) every SAGA algorithm I tested
I get a stacktrace.

If someone can confirm this I think this could be a serious trouble
(Tested on Linux - QGIS master compiled version)

Forgot to tell: 2.18.19 (rather obviously, in qgis3 OTF is always on).
Thanks for confirmation and comments.
All the best.

Hi

Trying to answer Mathias's questions:

Some features that interesting (at least to me):

   1. If there is a bug, you can assign someone directly in the sentry
   (must be a user for sure) or even you can create a GitHub ticket if you set
   it up (not sure if there is a support for redmine).
   2. We can mark a bug as fixed in the next release. It's really useful to
   make thing automatic
   3. We can see how often a bug occurs (better planning to do bug fix),
   and some statistic and nice graph (and weekly overview)
   4. We can see a bug that occurs again (regression)
   5. The bug report can be set up to provide some environment information
   (version, OS, etc) *perhaps we can make it optional to the user

But I think we need to ask the user whether they want to "send the bug
report" automatically to the sentry or not, since it may contain some
private things.

Have you noticed this in the measure tool info box part?:

- if OTF is off:

The calculations are based on:
Project CRS transformation is turned off. Distance is calculated in degrees,
based on project CRS (WGS84).
Ellipsoidal calculation is not possible with CRS transformation disabled.
Distance is roughly converted to degrees by using scale at equator (1 degree
= 111319.49 meters).


- if OTF is on:

The calculations are based on:
Project CRS transformation is turned on and ellipsoidal calculation is
selected.
The coordinates are transformed to the chosen ellipsoid (WGS84), and the
distance is calculated in meters.


Moreover the User Guide (paragraph 8.8) is more clear: 

QGIS provides four means of measuring geometries:
• the interactive measurement tools ,
• measuring in the Field Calculator,
• derived measures in the Identify Features tool,
• and a vector analysis tool: Vector→Geometry Tools→Export/Add Geometry
Columns

Measuring works within projected coordinate systems (e.g., UTM) and
unprojected data. The first three measuring tools behave equally to global
project settings:
• If “on the fly” CRS transformation (see Define On The Fly (OTF) CRS
Transformation) is enabled, the
default measurement metric is - different from most other GIS - ellipsoidal,
using the ellipsoid defined in
File → Project properties → General. This is true both when geographic and
projected coordinate systems
are defined for the project.
• If you want to calculate the projected / planimetric area or distance
using cartesian maths, the measurement ellipsoid has to be set to “None /
Planimetric” (File → Project properties → CRS). However, with a geographic
(= unprojected) CRS defined for the data and project, area and distance
measurement will be ellipsoidal.
• If “on the fly” CRS transformation is disabled, the measurement metric is
planimetric when the project coordinate system is projected and ellipsoidal
when the project coordinate system is unprojected / geographic.
However, neither the identify tool nor the field calculator will transform
your data to the project CRS before measuring. If you want to achieve this,
you have to use the vector analysis tool: Vector → Geometry Tools
→Export/Add Geometry Columns. Here, measurement is by default planimetric
except if you choose the ellipsoidal measure.

It's not a bug as much as very confusing 2.x behavior. The obscure
link between a "rendering" setting (OTF projection) and ellipsoidal
calculations (area/distance) is extremely confusing for users. We
couldn't change this in 2.x because of the API freeze and how embedded
this logic was in many areas of QGIS code and API.

That's why in 3.0 the whole OTF logic was reworked, so that OTF is
always on for rendering and doesn't the choice of ellipsoidal
calculations or not is totally based on the project's ellipsoid
setting.

So unfortunately for 2.18 there's really no choice but to ensure that
OTF projection setting is enabled.

(Apologies if my earlier reply sounded "flippant" - I didn't mean to
dismiss this issue. Rather I was just focusing on the "how can we
avoid in future" part here.)

I wouldn't mind seeing some policy/process put in place for pulling
stable releases/unscheduled updates when serious regressions are
found. I can think of 3/4 releases in the past where we've had similar
serious issues and would have been nice to have a way to push out
immediate fixes for these.

It was always my impression that these measurements can never be that 
accurate as the projections are approximated? Or do you know otherwise?

I'd be in favour of this - of course this will have a cost, and the
release manager has the final word here.
All the best.

we are not talking about approximations here, but of 30-40% errors.

I understand, thanks for the explanation. Then why not disabling
measurements when OTF is off? giving a totally false measurement does
not seem a good idea.
I believe 2.18 will be around for a good while, and I hate sending
around wrong results of which the user has no clue whatsoever.
Still unclear to me why the lack of ellipsoid would lead to 40% error,
but that's my ignorance.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] joined MemoryLayer gives wrong featurecount
Message-ID: <ac076dd7-a487-a3ab-28da-8b383073102d@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

See screenshot: top is jsononly-copy, then a geometry-less memory layer
which is joined to the bottom layer.

After creating the join: all is fine: featurecount is ok.
Reopening the project, the count is always zero.
The classification though is going OK! (bottom layer looks fine)
Reopening Layerproperties/style dialog and click OK features are
apperently recounted and again ok.

After I tried to debug it, I get the feeling that the
featurecounter-task-run is started a little too early, and the
expressions needed to evaluate for the counting are not ready yet.
Not sure if the memory layer is the problem or the join.
Also tried categorized style: same problem.

Can I force a 'recount' of the features?
Tried mapCanvas.update() etc... but featurecount does not change.

I like to create an issue for it, but it is hard to provide an example
dataset as the 'memory-layer' is filled via a plugin upon startup...

So hoping this first description rings a bell with somebody.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

First of all we need a fix.  Then we can decide if the next point release is
still far enough away to justify the extra effort.  We have 14 days left ;)

The commit apparently fixes something - reloadProvider expects the provider
name not the provider.  Now the call actually reloads something as it should
but that for some reason causes an endless recursion.  Maybe because the
modeler also scans the algorithms?  But I'm just guessing here.

Odd that it didn't error out before and also odd that the traceback is still
that short.

Message-ID: <EC43F59E-021E-4A09-8E1B-645AB5BFAEBF@kartoza.com>

Dear Friends

QGIS 3.4 is coming in October this year. Our little metadata group we did excellent work getting the foundations for a great metadata system implemented in QGIS 3.0. Now we are starting thinking about the next phase. I would like to initiate a call (or text chat meeting in Gitter) next week if possible to discus the next steps. The idea would be to revisit our roadmap document, and repeat the process we followed last time:

1) Identify the critical features and architecture for the next iteration (and publish a QEP)
2) Identify champions for the different components we want to build
3) Come up with costings for those components
4) Seek funding for building the components we define
5) Implement such features as we can obtain funding for or find volunteers for

I have started a doodle poll here to find a meeting time - I know it is going to be hard because we are spread across the globe. If it doesn't work trying to meet in real time I will take it off to a shared google doc that we can work on.

https://doodle.com/poll/7iwgz4wr398q5p6y


If you are interested to participate in the process, please let me know via the poll above.

If you or your organisation would like to see <pick your favourite standard> compliant metadata ingested and produced by QGIS and are able to support us with funding for this, please contact me off-list.

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

For your information, with the big hint from Matthias in the last email,
it's now fixed in 2.18.20. I checked in QGIS 3, it was working fine already.

This is one of the reasons why I wrote Geodesic Measure tool that is part
of Shape Tools. It is based on geographiclib's distance measures and is
relative accurate. I never knew whether I had the default QGIS measure tool
set correctly or not to give accurate measurements. More accurate
measurements could be obtained using geographiclib's gravity models such as
EGM2008, but that would require shipping the associated data which is large.

By the way I found out that the latest versions of proj.4 integrated
geographiclib. Is there a way to call these routines from a python plugin
in QGIS. I would assume the C code would be faster than the python library
which is what I use.

All the best.

Hi List,

Just wanted to let you know I've changed the Profile Tool plugin owner to 
Javier, who is the real developer for some time (Etienne and Patrice, who was 
taking care about the plugin last years are no longer acitive, and users was 
forced to use Javier's fork).

Btw. what is the difference between owner and maintainer? I can't change the 
latter (although it's not necessary if owners can upload new versions).

Hi Borys,

the maintaner can be changed in the control panel and she is the user who
created the plugin record in the DB.


Owners are zero or more additional user that have admin privileges over the
plugin.

Hi Andreas,

without 3D CMake seems to require 5.2.

5.6 should be no issue, in fact Ubuntu 16.04 has Qt 5.6.
(https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/qt5-default) - there you need to use
ubuntugis due to other dependencies issues.


Cheers

Marco

Hi,

I think PyQGIS would be the best, since the keywording would be very
efficient.

Cheers

Dear devs,


I am trying to compile QGIS3 (release_3-0) on a freshly install Ubuntu
18.04 (bionic). All seems to go well, no error messages during
configuration or running make and make install.

When trying to run QGIS, however, I am getting the following error:

./qgis: error while loading shared libraries: libqgis_app.so.3.0.2:
cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

Any idea what went wrong here, and how to solve this?

Best wishes,

Paulo

Have a look on https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL and search
"error while loading shared libraries". Does it help?

Hi

Just to add to Ismail’s reply below, Sentry does not replace your bug tracker, it works with it. I’d be happy to do a little walk through on Zoom if anyone wants to see our instance demonstrated.

Regards

Hi all, 

I'm running qgis on linux mate desktop (archlinux) and I'm unable to use
processing modeler due to display behaviour. Item are not selectable :
too small. 

Tried on qgis2 and it looks nice and usable. Any idea how to solve
appearance problem to use processing modeler in qgis 3 ? 

I attach screenshots to this message.

Sincerely, 

Sylvain

The shortcut used to start it has to specify LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the 
shortcut parameters

Thanks Patrick, adding the export statement to the file ~/.profile does 
the trick for me.

The shortcut parameters is the one to consider if you have mulitple 
versions installed. If I am building it often it is so I can have 
several different versions

I am not super familiar with QGIS’ interface to PROJ but I don’t think there’s a way to do that at the moment. The new PROJ API exposes a function that computes the geodesic distance between two points directly: https://proj4.org/development/reference/functions.html#c.proj_lp_dist

This would be a good idea to expose once QGIS incorporates the new PROJ API. The calculations are super fast and Charles Karney, the developer of GeograhpicLib, says that they are accurate to micrometer level.

/Kristian

PS. The proj_factors function is also a good candidate for inclusion in the QGIS Python API since it gives direct access to various cartographic properties of a projection: https://proj4.org/development/reference/functions.html#c.proj_factors

Emne: Re: [QGIS-Developer] Length measurement weirdness (again)

This is one of the reasons why I wrote Geodesic Measure tool that is part of Shape Tools. It is based on geographiclib's distance measures and is relative accurate. I never knew whether I had the default QGIS measure tool set correctly or not to give accurate measurements. More accurate measurements could be obtained using geographiclib's gravity models such as EGM2008, but that would require shipping the associated data which is large.

By the way I found out that the latest versions of proj.4 integrated geographiclib. Is there a way to call these routines from a python plugin in QGIS. I would assume the C code would be faster than the python library which is what I use.

All the best.

I understand, thanks for the explanation. Then why not disabling
measurements when OTF is off? giving a totally false measurement does
not seem a good idea.
I believe 2.18 will be around for a good while, and I hate sending
around wrong results of which the user has no clue whatsoever.
Still unclear to me why the lack of ellipsoid would lead to 40% error,
but that's my ignorance.
All the best.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] 32 by 3.2?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshEOT6EwAKYAfJu-tUKravTeiOdCeK2pmQ9ugU9YZg3QA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

It's no surprise to anyone familiar with the QGIS project that we've
got an issue with the Pull Request queue. It's been slowly growing
over time, recently hitting over 150 open requests! It's a bit of an
embarrassment to the project (some of these PRs have been open for
years!), and is likely causing us to lose new contributors and code.

The usual magic QGIS coding pixies did some work lately and squashed
the queue back below 100 requests. But the remaining ones are all the
difficult, unfinished or orphaned PRs...

PR reviewing is hard. Not everyone can review every open PR due to
different familiarity with areas of the codebase. (Which is why I
don't think a funding grant to cover this will ever work
successfully). And no-one wants to be the 'bad guy" who closes an
unmerged PR representing someone else's hard work.

So I propose a "32 by 3.2" sprint, where we ALL collaboratively aim to
reduce the PR queue to <32 open requests before 3.2 release.

I think we could achieve this by:

1. Adopting a hard-line approach to the older, orphaned PRs. Even if
they have some value or reflect real issues, if no-one is interested
in cleaning up the request to get it merge ready then we close it.

2. Adopt a "open-one, close-one" guideline for core committers. Heck,
I think every core committer has at least 1 or 2 open PRs representing
various experiments and WIP in unfinished states. These should either
be finished off, or closed and re-opened when the work is actually
ready to go. And for test PRs which are "for comment only" I'd suggest
a QEP is more likely to get better feedback and is the more
appropriate place for this discussion of this nature.

3. Closing orphaned or risky PRs which are targeted to 2.18 and which
have been fixed in master branch.

4. Sharing the hard work so that the magic pixies don't lose their
magic powers :)

Thoughts?

I personally like this strategy, but as someone who is new to the project and has made only one PR (which was merged rather quickly), how can I help?

This seems to really only concern those who maintain the code, leaving many unable to do much.

Unfortunately that's true - it really comes down to current
maintainers and anyone with an open, unmerged PR to assist.

But, of course, new contributions are ALWAYS welcome :D

Hi all,
a plugin[0], quite interesting, contains compiled+src C code[1]. We
generally avoid this, so the question is: what can we suggest to the author?
All the best, and thanks.

It makes sense to me, thanks Nyall for raising this point.
What worries me most is scaring away many potential good contributors.
Prhaps we could reduce this risk by setting up more stringent
requirements for a PR, or asking to have a core dev to sponsor each PR
before issuing it? Of course a full tutoring programme would mean a lot
of extra work for already overstretched devs, so we must keep
lightweight here.
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

Do we know the license of the code? I don't find any source code in the

Looks like a great plugin - at least if the sample results are
anything to go by!

I've had a quick look over the code and there's nothing too scary
there. I'd suggest that we could approach the author of the plugin and
see if they are interested in submitting the code to the master
branch, so that the code is compiled alongside qgis. This way the
binary won't be an issue, and the algorithm will become available
out-of-the-box. Seems like a win all round to me.

Hi Nyall,

Really good points in here.

Let's go!

They are all good ideas to reduce the size of the queue again to a
manageable size.

In terms of a longer-term sustainability approach, I'd like to see a
mechanism that comments on pull requests after 3 months of no activity
and closes them a month later if no new commits or comments have been made.

Message-ID: <fcc7d515-6e6a-4016-534d-bd0661b99144@rasdaman.com>

Hello QGIS developers,

I'm working for Rasdaman company (www.rasdaman.com - Opensource Raster
database (www.rasdaman.org) - created by Prof. Dr. Peter Baumann).
Rasdaman is conformable with OGC Web Coverage Service (WCS) version
2.0.1 and contributed to create multiple extensions
(http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) and also main contributor
of OGC Web Coverage Processing Service (WCPS -
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcps). Rasdaman also contributed
to QGIS with this WCPS plugin
(https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/QgsWcpsClient1/ [1]) written in Python.

However, in QGIS latest version 2.8, QGIS native WCS tool only supports
WCS version 1.0.0, 1.1.0, therefore it cannot work with Rasdaman for
requesting WCS 2.0.1 version. What we'd like to do and ask is:

+ We could use the Python opensource OWSLib
(https://github.com/earthserver-eu/OWSLib/tree/olcl-wcs-200 and
https://github.com/earthserver-eu/OGC_WCS_tutorial) which supports WCS
version 2.0.1 and WCPS to extend the existing WCPS QGIS plugin from
Rasdaman [1].

+ Is that possible to bring this plugin to be added natively in QGIS for
WCS feature (besides version 1.0.0, 1.1.0) in next QGIS version? And is
this plugin needed to be developed as C++ to be able to work with QGIS
core functionality?

Thanks,

please note that the latest QGIS version is 3. The latest LTR is 2.18.
We would certainly welcome any effort in adding and modernizing OGC
support in QGIS - the only reason we have not done it already is the
usual lack of time. So if you are interested we certainly welcome you on
board.
Let's discuss the details here.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi,

Just a quick note that I've been working on WCS support to GDAL and it now
supports 2.0.1. It's been tested against Rasdaman and others but more
testing would be useful, especially cases with temporal and other
multidimensional data.

Best regards,

Ari

Thanks. How does this relate to QGIS? We have native support, although
my impression is that it has been slightly neglected in the last period.
All the best.

I agree with nyall, the problem with distributing dll or os we can trust
that they are build against the plugin code.

years ago we almost agreed to ask plugin authors to install dll or .so by
the plugin or manually from a third party repo with the express consensus
of the author. I wouldn't host binaries in the plugin repo.

Another benefit from merging into core: we could use this as an option
for the live hillshade renderer. Win!

Sorry for the spam: I meant to add - since I'm passionate about both
cartography and processing, I'd be more than happy to mentor this
change.

+1 for all points... sorry to be not so helpful in this period doing my
review part for lack of time

I would close some my PRs that I've no time to work on, but I know there
are companies interested about that fixes. Would be fair they take care of
that. Just matter to setup a appopriate postgis/pki/docker setup to
reactivate some PKI tests.

Might be a good time to contact them and tell them about the benefits,
work already put into this (which would be a pity to loose) and let them
know what's required to make things happen.

Not sure there is a lot that can be done from this lists perspective I
think?

Hi all,

If you're not aware, North Road have been running a crowd funding
campaign to implement drill-down (cascading) field support within QGIS
forms.

We’re now nearing the final hours of this campaign, and thanks to
numerous generous backers we’re very close to hitting the funding
goal! This is a really exciting new feature which would help add
greater flexibility and power to QGIS feature forms, but in order to
implement it for QGIS 3.2 we need to hit the funding target by 11 May
2018.

As a result, we’re dropping the minimum contribution amount and
throwing open the campaign for payments of any amount. You can read
more about this (and the campaign itself) here:

https://north-road.com/2018/05/08/drill-down-cascading-forms-in-qgis-crowdfund-final-stretch/

Spread the word if you'd like to see this feature land in QGIS 3.2!

Cheers,
Nyall

+1 for a spring ponctual cleanup,
but...  this won't solve the long term issue of having enough ressources to
assume review process.

Do some of you already include a review and a documentation cost in your
estimates  ?


Maybe QGIS.org could act as a third party to transfer those funds to a
dedicated budget ?

QGIS.org could then be hiring some of the dev's - like we do for the bugfix
process. Or at least compensate part of the efforts spend.

To avoid too much spreadsheet manual work, we could track hours spend in
the pull request  directly maybe.
Gitlab has time tracking support, and github seems to have a third party
app, free for open source projects.

Régis

Just a quick question, do you implement with C++? I'm not sure how QGIS
built-in WCS supports version 1.0.0 and 1.1.0 was developed. For now,
Rasdaman company can support resource with Python to implement QGIS WCS
2.0.1 + WCPS plugin.

It would be great that your work could improve built-in QGIS WCS and it
could be easily extended for WCPS also.

Thanks,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Simple KML Importer
Message-ID: <CABPxTTpdNBSKyQtjjDUvUVpfyh1699gSrOYjsq2ZZy_KQ8e4wQ@mail.gmail.com>

We have had issues with importing KMLs into QGIS. The situation is that if
there are many folders in a KML, QGIS imports each as a layer and is very
slow at importing or crashes during the import if there happens to be
hundreds of layers. This also happens using ArcGIS. I am assuming that both
use GDAL and in some respects GDAL tries to do too much. Consequently, I
wrote a simple KML plugin to import KML/KMZ files in the way we wanted them.

I am assuming that if we have had issues others have had them as well.
Would you like this plugin uploaded to the official repo?

The biggest difference is that rather than create multiple layers for each
folder of KMLs, I create one point layer, one line layer and one polygon
layer if required. I add an additional field that contains the folder
structure for each feature.

Let me know if you think if this plugin should go into the QGIS plugin
repo. I would be happy to share it. Here is the plugin repo. I am
converting for QGIS 3 as well. Right now it is just for QGIS 2.x.

Thanks,

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Adding help text for processing plugin
Message-ID: <872D7466-8384-4E65-B2CF-397FED57ECB5@gmail.com>

Hi,

I’m wondering if it’s possible to add help text (that will show up in right-hand sidebar) for a processing plugin that I’m developing in QGIS3.

I think I found where the help text for the native QGIS plugins comes from (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/help/qgis.yaml <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/help/qgis.yaml>), but I’m not sure how I might be able to provide my own help text for a processing plugin I’m developing.

Thanks,
Phil Ribbens

You just need to implement the shortHelpString method in your
algorithm and return the translated help text.

GDAL is a data provider for QGIS and for example Even wrote in an issue 
concerning the WCS driver(*) that "... the lack of _DESC will prevent 
for example clients like QGIS to be able to use the subdatasets."

I have not look deeply into how the GDAL data provider works in QGIS, 
however.

It would be good to join the efforts somehow since it was quite a pain 
to support different WCS servers.

Yes. It is a native C++ driver in GDAL.

Hi,
are you suggesting to drop native QGIS WCS support in favour of the GDAL
implementation?
All the best, and thanks.

No. First of all, I have not tested the QGIS WCS support at all. I'm a 
long time GDAL user and developer. A case came up where I needed to 
develop a demonstration system that would use WCS as a GDAL data source. 
That's why I proceeded to update the then (last October) existing driver.

Best,

Ari

Hi Winnie,
thanks for offering your help!

You can follow those guidelines
https://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/documentation_guidelines/first_contribution.html

If you are not familiar with C++, starting with some python code is a
smooth start to discover QGIS API.

and finally, don't be shy to ask for help here.

Best regards,
Régis

On Qgis 2.18.19 I can load a Esri Personal geodatabase (*.mdb) by adding the lines below to qgis.bat:

 

"

set OGR_SKIP=ODBC
set PGEO_DRIVER_TEMPLATE=DRIVER=Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb);DBQ=%%s

"

 

Anyone Can help on how to add a personal geodatabase on Qgis 3?

Or please change the bug report (https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18234) I opened to regression type.

 

Thanks

It seems the problem is in how QGIS 3 is launched from the Start Menu link on
Windows: it now directly runs qgis-bin.exe instead of qgis.bat (or
qgis-ltr.bat) like was for QGIS 2.18.

Therefore, to ensure that OGR_SKIP and PGEO_DRIVER_TEMPLATE are correctly
set before QGIS 3 starts, you need to run qgis.bat (with the two line
added).

and you can also, alternatively:

- set the two variables as User or System Windows Environment Variables (in
the Windows Advanced System Settings)

or

- set the two variables in QGIS through Settings -> Options | System |
Environment


The names and the values of the variables are:

variable name: OGR_SKIP
value: ODBC

variable name: PGEO_DRIVER_TEMPLATE
value: DRIVER=Microsoft Access Driver (*.mdb, *.accdb);DBQ=%s

note that there is only one percent sign in the value of
PGEO_DRIVER_TEMPLATE variable.


In both cases, you can launch QGIS normally through the Start Menu link.

I've updated the issue, but I cannot close it.
I've also added an answer to the stackexchange question, hoping this could

Hi QGIS devs,

I've created a ticket about improving how WFS paging and max features is implemented in the UI https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18935 It'd be good to get some sort of consensus on an implementation so please comment on the ticket if you have any good ideas.

Hi,

I have a problem with loading a project file at the end of a python plugin:

    project = QgsProject.instance()
    project.read(QFileInfo(projectFile))         # read the new project file

Only a few layers are loaded, no styles etc. When I close the project and reload it manually, everthing is o.k.

How can I load the project file correctly?

Best wishes,

Message-ID: <CAB28Ash8gogRYFERhDT-j4-f1V3--DLGNyoN7R9b=Zr+yhikaw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a quick heads up - I've finally had the chance to finish off the
guide to porting Processing 2.x algorithms to 3.x API and merged it
into the API docs.

You can find it here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/doc/porting_processing.dox


Hope it helps -- of course, more contributions and greater detail
would be very much appreciated. So if in your algorithm porting you
come across some traps/tricks you think should be added, please open a
pull request adding these!

Cheers,
Nyall

Message-ID: <CAB28Asj6fNxVZugnEG9MGBMN3CLkWczWH_Ys--sRdON=U3wzxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'd like to float this idea of dropping this list of code maintainers
from the website:

https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/governance/governance.html#code-maintainers

Rationale:

- It's not really relevant anymore - most areas of code are "shared
responsibilities"
- It's horribly outdated, including developers who are no longer
actively involved in the project and missing lots of the most active
developers (e.g. compare to the list at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/contributors !)
- PRs aren't assigned based on this list - rather they are "self
assigned" by interested developers.

Yep agreed, this list is never complete. So ok to drop it.

Shortly looked at a way to create such a list based on github data, found:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/graphs/contributors-data
(seems to work only in a github session), but mayb there is such a
request doable via github api?

Hi,

I'd like to raise this on the dev list since it seems to be a bug. Ticket:
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18384

Here is the basic issue as Michel observed it:

​I've actually been able to reproduce 2.18 results in 3.x but only if
@geometry_part_num was used in a different context besides the marker line
as well.

Here's a screencast of what I think is pretty odd behavior:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/cvyqeecpq0uis1j/QGIS%20Geometry%20Generator%20geometry_part_num.mp4?dl=0

Took me a couple of hours to find out why @geometry_part_num behaved
seemingly randomly.

Was this a purposeful change?

Regards,
Anita

Nope, just a bug. I know what the issue is here, I'll fix when I get a chance.

the list is neither up to date nor used anywhere; at best it's misleading.

I've no strong opinion in favor or against... for sure I result maintainer
for some plugins that where developed under a "company" environment. The
company should be in charge to maintain that. Anyone want to hire a
developer that have knowledge of the plugin can use git log to find who
worked on that.

so +1

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Enum in Modeler
Message-ID: <b39ecea6-faf7-306e-c1e6-69339fdc0646@gmail.com>

Hi all,

testing the new Enum Input in the Processing Modeler I'm quite confused..

It seems now that if an algorithm has a Enum parameter (e.g. the Buffer
has 2, "End cap style" and "Join style") and the user has not defined an
Enum input, then it is possible to choose between the standard algorithm
options.

But it the user has an Enum input specified then the algorithm in the
modeler only allows to choose the Enum input.

Somebody confirm this behavior?

Thanks

Cheers

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Server - SSL handshake failed for cascading
	WMS
Message-ID: <CAHmgCsaYobYPpJBzmrhtxQzbmzo5VW_wmqq3av-MXEAKaAhVMg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello List,

This question was already asked in Jan 2017, but no solution was posted.
http://osgeo-org.1560.x6.nabble.com/QGIS-Server-SSL-handshake-failed-for-
cascading-WMS-td5305094.html

The problem: if QGIS uses an HTTPS (SSL) WMS service, the WMS works nicely
in QGIS desktop. However, if you use the same .qgs project file on QGIS
Server, all requests to the HTTPS (SSL) WMS server result in an  SSL
handshake error.

This (still) happens on:
Ubuntu 16.04
QGIS server 2.18
An example WMS https server showing the problem is: https://geodata.
nationaalgeoregister.nl/bag/ows

A workaround could be to use the HTTP version of the WMS instead of the
HTTPS version. However, the capabilities of many HTTP services advertise
the HTTPS version for the GETMAP, GETFEATUREINFO and GETLEGENDGRAPHIC
endpoints.

The SSL problem also arises when trying to use WFS services over HTTPS from
QGIS Server.

Is this a known problem? Is there a workaround? Should I file a bug report?

Thanks,

Anne

Hi Anne,
did you test QGIS 3.0 also?
Could you create an issue in issue.qgis.org tracker?

I found that one, that seemed related https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18634

Régis

Hello Régis,

I did not yet try QGIS server 3.0 on Ubuntu yet (not clear to me how to
install it, will look at it again).

Thanks for pointing me to the problem described on https://issues.qgis.org/
issues/18634, however, it seems to be different from the SSL handshake
problem: their server was requesting over HTTP because the HTTPS
capabilities were advertising HTTP services (which is a not a QGIS server
problem).

I've changed my mind. Those warnings should be removed from the
message log, and shifted off to the console only.

See https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/6991

I didn't realise how slow they made rendering until I hit this same
issue on a recent project, and the cause was the labeling feature
cropping, so not even anything which is user-fixable.

Message-ID: <1526392327172-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

I've just uploaded a new experimental QGIS plugin web2qgis. It tries to
import webmaps into QGIS. It's at a very early stage at the moment:

- Leaflet webmaps only
- XYZ tileserver and vector layers only
- no vector styles imported

The repo is here:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/web2qgis

I'd very much appreciate people testing it. Ideally, if course, code
contributions would be incredibly welcome.

Thanks

Tom

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PSA: The new SIP_THROW macro
Message-ID: <CAB28AsgUy+de0P6o35z7p-h7MVpCV96UrzWrmoVzcSdhgbfoug@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just a quick heads up about a recent addition to QGIS 3.2 regarding
the Python bindings.

In https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/0f78277 I've added a new
"SIP_THROW" macro. The idea behind this is that SIP uses the
deprecated "throw(...)" annotations in order to determine which
exceptions may be thrown by c++ code. Without these, only a generic
unknown exception is throw, which is of limited value to Python code
(losing any valuable message and exception type). (side note - this
took a LONG time for me to discover... I don't believe it's explicitly
stated anywhere in the sip documentation, at least not that I've been
able to find).

So in this commit I've added a new SIP_THROW macro, which can be added
to a method's declaration:

    bool doSomething() SIP_THROW( QgsCsException );

This is ignored outside of sipify, so we don't actually use the
deprecated c++ throw annotations when compiling, but sipify picks it
up and adds the appropriate change to the sip definition for the
method:

   bool doSomething() throw( QgsCsException );

Without the throw annotation the generated sip code looks something like this:

            try
            {
            sipCpp= new  ::(sipCpp->doSomething());
            }
            catch (...)
            {
                ...
                sipRaiseUnknownException();
                return NULL;
            }

So when the doSomething raises a c++ exception, all the Python caller
gets is the unknown generic exception.

Using the throw annotation the generated code gets expanded to something like:

            try
            {
            sipRes = new  ::(sipCpp->doSomething());
            }
            catch (QgsCsException &sipExceptionRef)
            {
                ...
                PyErr_SetString(sipException_QgsCsException,
sipExceptionRef.what().toUtf8().constData() );
               ...
                return NULL;
            }
            catch (...)
            {
                ....
                sipRaiseUnknownException();
                return NULL;
            }

This means that calling the method from Python will raise the
QgsCsException (when thrown by the c++ method) instead of a generic
exception, giving much more useful debugging information to the caller
and allowing them to handle the specific exception type.

I've made this change throughout Processing (for
QgsProcessingException), so now there's much more explicit error
messages given to both Python and end users of processing algorithms.
It'd be nice to start adding the same for QgsCsException to any
methods which can throw this exception... so if you come across one of
these methods in the c++ code which is missing the SIP_THROW
annotation, please feel free to go ahead and add it!

Cheers,
Nyall

Message-ID: <CAN-Pxswc38-QiZ5zuasC2ZBaN7o1h7dQF5FN-PSyhx3RLvOm2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone!

I would like to share with you my project Improve GRASS GIS integration in
QGIS 3 which was chosen to Google Summer of Code 2018. This is GRASS GIS
project, but because this project is about integration with QGIS, I am very
interested in knowing what QGIS community thinks of it, all suggestions and
ideas are welcome!

Below are the links to my GSoC proposal [1], wiki [2] and GitHub repository
[3].

Hi guys,

I have a fresh compiled QGIS master and no matter which data I load, but
opening the style dock panel - > categorized style once I click on the
Change ... button to change the symbol type QGIS dies. No stack traces,
just:

QGIS died on signal 11Aborted

the same button in the Layer Properties works fine.

Someone confirm?

Cheers

Message-ID: <CA+qEb=3WUYX1JS6=U=7PakscO4A=tKK8sJ7RA9OmCL0dqmXxyQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

In QGIS 2 there was this handy function to load a Python dict with string
mapping into a QgsComposition object, so each string (not only label, also
eg. HTML) inside a given .qpt project was substituted accordingly ->
https://qgis.org/api/2.18/classQgsComposition.html#ac147dd9e3ee689a7fdfdca58743e7be8

I know Composition stuff was moved to QgsLayout in Q 3. In the
documentation I found only this one:
https://qgis.org/api/classQgsLayout.html#ad84ff95e98598ed3c29eef973d7b4bff
but it doesn't seem to support the substitution map. What is the way to
substitute string in Q 3?

Best regards

Hi Radek,
thanks for this. Interesting and welcome proposal. Please work tightly
with QGIS community, to ensure your work will be readily integrated into
core if the project is successful.
In particular, I would strongly suggest you to check with other
backends' communities, in order to have as a general solution as possible.
All the best.

I see, that's a different path than the one in Harrisou's comment.

I'll have a look to that too.

In qgis3 you must use string search and replace, that is what the qgis2
implementation was doing.

	on SHP files
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw2pfEwDAPGJoMHOMdeFSkwthESQqW=u+C_GJ3MyYOo-vw@mail.gmail.com>

​Hi,

I have a problem that is occurring on QGIS 2.18.x but not on 2.14.x.

​From a POSTGIS layer I selected some features, then I exported them to a
SHP files (with Save from Layer submenu). Opening the attribute table I can
see their attributes.

Then on POSTGIS layer I have selected other features, then I copied and
pasted them on SHP file. The result? I see the copied geometries, but QGIS
filled their attributes with NULL values...

It's a known bug?

Hi Luca,

how long are the attribute names on your postgres tables?

​They are under 8 characters, but right now I can't reproduce this bug. It
appears occasionaly time to time. :-( ​

Hi,

When I type https://issues.qgis.org in a browser I get to the qgis
landing page, to go to the issue page itself I need to navigate to the
subfolder https://issues.qgis.org/issues .

Would it be possible to forward there automatically?

Thanks a lot and best regards

Argh, forget that, the browser here was autocompleting to
issues.qgis.COM for some reason.

Sorry for the noise.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Weird behavior with raster styles
Message-ID: <4df40a16-f05d-6d66-756e-c1e379fb2044@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

not sure if this is an issue or if I am missing something.

If I load a raster already styled with a .qml file, in the Raster Layer
Style properties, suppose a singleband pseudo color, in the box I can
see the style loaded, but not in the color ramp box.

Any click (changing min/max, interpolation method, etc) drops the custom
style loaded and the current color ramp is chosen by default, losing all
the chances to make further customization with the "old" style.

Am I missing something when loading the style?

Thanks for any feedback

Cheers

Matteo

Hi,

The blog/guide is probably already outdated. Do you need to compile QGIS
with 3D from source? 3D canvas is already available from regular QGIS 3.x
releases.

They gave us 120 minutes now, which should solve the issue!
But up to when, I don't know ;)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PostGIS out-of-db raster rendering as a black box
	in QGIS
Message-ID: <1526568013911-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

I load a geotiff with raster2pgsql with the -R param for having an out of db
stored raster in PostGIS.
The raster renders in QGIS through the DB Manager as a black box with no
values. Running a raster layer statistics in QGIS returns 0 for all values.
I have tried loading the raster as a in-db raster and this works fine
rendering in QGIS.

Out-db is enabled:
SET postgis.enable_outdb_rasters TO True;
SHOW postgis.enable_outdb_rasters;

ST_SummaryStats in PostGIS returns the same for both in- and out-of-db
raster.

The out-db raster is registered correct in PostGIS:

SELECT r_table_name, r_raster_column, out_db FROM raster_columns;
returning: sa_out, rast, {true,true,true,true}

Since raster2pgsql uses GDAL I suspect GDAL within QGIS is able to read the
raster to QGIS.

The sample tif is available for download here: 
3320D_2010_315_RGB_LATLNG.TIF
<http://lanstorp.com/files/3320D_2010_315_RGB_LATLNG.TIF>  

It is loaded into PostGIS with:
raster2pgsql -C -R -F -Y -I
C:\map\raster2pg\tif\3320D_2010_315_RGB_LATLNG.TIF myschema.sa_out | psql -U
postgres -d sandbox localhost -p 5432

Is this a GDAL or QGIS problem? Any solution? Anyone able to render an
out-of-db raster from PostGIS?

Jakob

Hi Alessandro, 

Originally, there was the idea to introduce a menu that lists more than
just actions. See https://issues.qgis.org/issues/10288 

e.g. also to list derived information based on a feature (same
information that is also available in the panel of the info tool. 

I am sure that other people would find other ideas to extend this menu. 

But I agree with you, that an empty menu is not so nice. Would you
suggest hiding the menu if nothing is in there? 

Anyway - i don't think it is a major problem - either way. We have other
more ugly things ... UI-wise.

Jakob,

This is a limitation of the GDAL PostgisRaster client driver that I'm 
currently working on. The enhancement to support out-of-db rasters 
in the driver should land in GDAL master in a few hours.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Using Atlas in QGIS 3 to make a print ready
	publication
Message-ID: <B98EBDB1-3706-49BE-AB23-7FFC89CD6223@kartoza.com>

Hi All (mainly Nyall I guess)

I have been playing with atlas in QGIS 3 to make a book prototype for a map series. In the past when I used atlas, it was just to share as a PDF or manually print out a map series. Now I want to prepare something to send to a printer and I realise the requirements are a little different:

* have a page for the cover outside on the left side, back cover outside on the right
* a page with front cover inside on the left and the right
* have one or more ‘front matter pages’ with a matching back matter page for each
* have the map series with each page having TWO maps from the map series. For example the first page would have on the left Page 1 and on the right Page 30 (where we have a  30 area series in atlas for example). Then the next page would have two map items : Page 2 on the left, Page 29 on the right and so on.

So I can manage a lot of this workflow by e.g. using separate composer layouts for the front / back matter stuff. What I haven’t thought of a way to do is having two atlas pages on the same layout.  Basically what is needed is the ability to trigger successive increments in the atlas counter if there are two maps (and other elements such as tables) that are controlled by atlas on the same layout.

This is probably better explained by my diagram below:


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/178003/40220376-34c77d00-5a79-11e8-9c09-b1b338915de5.png


So my questions are :

1) Has anyone dealt with this and if so, how did you solve it?
2) How much work would it be to enable support for this kind of work flow?
3) Are there any plans to have ‘print once’ pages in composer so that in a layout I could have pages for front matter in ‘print once’ mode, one or more atlas driven pages that will repeat for each atlas area, pages for back matter in 'print once’ mode.

Basically if we had this I could make a single print-ready PDF from one layout.

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim

I don't know if it answers all your needs (haven't played with it yet, myself) but you may give a look to the layout reporting framework. See https://north-road.com/2018/01/23/exploring-reports-in-qgis-3-0-the-ultimate-guide

Hi

Thanks Harrissou - yes I know about reports and did try to do it using that, but I don’t think it will help me in this case. Happy if someone can show me that I am wrong here :-)

Yes, I suppose it's better to hide it when it's empty.

Anyway - i don't think it is a major problem - either way. We have other

Not  a good reason to add another one ;-)

Good news, thanks Even. There are a few tickets related to this in QGIS
bugtracker, probably it is worth checking them once fixes are landed.
e.g. https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18054
https://issues.qgis.org/issues/8073
All the best.

Hi,

I was also confronted to this weird auto-classification behavior
(https://issues.qgis.org/issues/17102) and it seems it can be tricky to
reproduce.

As I pointed in the issue discussion, it seems to me that classification
should happen only and only if the user explicitly click on the classify
button.

Maybee we need to fill a new ticket.

Hi,

thanks for pointing me to the issues you opened.

I have updated https://issues.qgis.org/issues/18153 with a minimal
example (raster + qml) that could help to understand the problem.

Cheers

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS 3.0: does not work under Windows (Anaconda
	package)
Message-ID: <8a1032e3-e0c6-2b1f-299e-d828d14989ad@yandex.ru>

Hi folks!

I've just tried to install QGIS 3.0 package in my Anaconda (Win7x64, 
Python 3.6 x64). I wanted to use QGIS widgets in my PyQt application. 
Alas, QGIS works incorrectly: at first, when I just tried to import qgis 
modules in Python, it said that it cannot find them. And when I manually 
set the PYTHONPATH, QGISPATH and PATH variables, it simply does not show 
my map (only the blank white screen).

Under Ubuntu 18.04 the script works correctly (there I just made 
`apt-get install python3-qgis`).

Can you tell me, how can I make it work under Windows too?

Here's my test script:

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QWidget, QFrame, QHBoxLayout, QGridLayout

from qgis._core import QgsApplication, QgsRasterLayer
from qgis._gui import QgsMapCanvas


class TestWidget(QWidget):
     def __init__(self, parent=None):
         super(TestWidget, self).__init__(parent)
         self.main_layout = QHBoxLayout(self)
         self.canvas = QgsMapCanvas()
         self.main_layout.addWidget(self.canvas)

         base_layer_path = 
os.path.join(os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__)), "world.mbtiles")
         self.base_layer = QgsRasterLayer(base_layer_path, 'world')
         self.canvas.setLayers([self.base_layer])
         self.canvas.zoomToFullExtent()


if __name__ == '__main__':
     qgs = QgsApplication([], False)
     qgs.setPrefixPath(os.environ.get('QGISPATH', '/usr'), True)
     qgs.initQgis()

     w = TestWidget()
     w.show()

     qgs.exec_()
     qgs.exitQgis()


And here's my test map data (world.mbtiles): 
https://www.sendspace.com/filegroup/8OqffqxS3aWuRdwr4iolRQ


And here are my environment variables (set under Windows):


PYTHONPATH=C:/Anaconda3/Library/python
QGISPATH=C:/Anaconda3
PATH=C:/Anaconda3/share/qgis/python/qgis;C:/Anaconda3/Library/bin

Hi Tim
This sounds like what the new Reports feature was built to do. Especially
with the header/footer pages and triggers for different map content. Have
you tried this in Reports in 3.0?

Hi Kurt

Thanks for your reply. Yep I have tried reports. Neither report (controlled by report) or atlas (controlled by atlas) offer a way to increment the atlas counter on the same layout page which sis what I basically need. If you look at the image from my original post it should hopefully make it clearer what I am trying to do.

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim,

To do what you want, the only way I can imagine is creating a Layer with
two geometry columns for coverage. The first column would be a "normal"
geometry column and could be used by atlas to provide the left page
iteration. The second column could be stored in WKT, and using the data
defined overwrite on the extent options to provide the right page iteration.

The problem is that the coverage layer would need to be carefully
(manually) crafted to create the odd and even pages. It would need to
titeBesides, for the right page you would not be able to use atlas
variables.

I wonder if it wouldn't be easier to create all the individual pages
normally using reports (to add static pages), export to PDF, and then
create a booklet from it. I bet there are tools for that.

For what I could gather, this kind of work is called creating a booklet, or
page imposition. There is a python library to work with that:

https://pypi.org/project/PdfImpose/

Best regards,

Alex Neto

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Running qgis2to3 on windows
Message-ID: <CAECJsSp-19wG2FDbW98PAkdpHatRQY6uGA4UmrXLNJaPdh-UGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to update a plugin of mine to QGIS3 and follow instructions at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/Plugin-migration-to-QGIS-3
I'm on Windows 10 and am not used to dev env and despite the use of osgeo4w
i encountered some issues.
After some readings here and there, I ran in the osgeo4w shell the
`py3_env` call to update my environment, leading to
PATH contains C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36
PYTHONHOME = C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36
PYTHONPATH = C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\Lib

Following the wiki, I ran `pip install future` or `pip3 install future`
(I'll realize later that future was already installed) but any call of
pip/pip3 like a simple `pip --help` results in *Fatal error in launcher:
Unable to create process using '"'*
After some search, I found that the call i should do is `python3 -m pip
install future` [1]. Did I miss something or would the guidelines need some
contextualization for beginners like me?

Then running `python3 -m pip install qgis2to3` downloads and installs the
qgis2to3 package in the osgeo4w. But when i run `qgis2to3
/path/to/my/plugin` I simply get a dialog to select the app I'd like to use
to open the file (which happens to be
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\lib\site-packages\qgis2to3\__init__.py). No
more. I don't know what to do ...
Sorry if these are noob concerns but I can't move forward so any help would
be more than welcome.

Thanks,
Harrissou

Hi Tom,

Not really. It expects qgis2to3 to be a file in such a command. But it
makes me remind to look for a qgis2to3 file and i found it in
C:\OSGeo4W64\apps\Python36\Scripts. Moving to that folder and calling
`qgis2to3 -w /path/to/my/plugin` did the trick.

Thanks for your help.

Next question: I realize that other than changing my existing files it also
creates some .py.bak files. Anyone knows what I am supposed to do with
them? Should they also be in the published version (they seem to be
generated automatically)?

H.

Yeah I though of similar things too though I was looking more for something we could give to end users (i.e. something clever we could add to core to support producing print ready books).

So maybe a plugin using pdfimpose (thanks for sharing that library, I havent seen it before!) might do it. I will go and check it out next weekend.

For ‘doing it in core’ I was wondering if we couldn’t have a concept of a frame item which is a virtual page that you can add to a layout letting you basically have two (or more) frames on a page side by side, with the atlas incrementing the currentAtlasFeature as it visits each frame.

Tim

Digitizing tools is a 3rd party plugin - you need to report all issues
to the plugin author, not the QGIS project:

For example the first page would have on the left Page 1 and on the right Page 30 (where we have a  30 area series in atlas for example). Then the next page would have two map items : Page 2 on the left, Page 29 on the right and so on.

What I haven’t thought of a way to do is having two atlas pages on the same layout.  Basically what is needed is the ability to trigger successive increments in the atlas counter if there are two maps (and other elements such as tables) that are controlled by atlas on the same layout.

I'm wondering if you could solve this by doing something like:

1. apply a filter to your atlas so you only iterate over half the features
2. don't use the built-in "controlled by atlas" setting for maps, but
instead retrieve the second page feature directly using the
get_feature function, and then use data defined x min/x max/ etc and
to set the scale/extents of the second page map.
3. similarly, use get_feature to retrieve attributes for the second
page feature for the surrounding text content.

> 2) How much work would it be to enable support for this kind of work flow?

Not as far as I know. I'd personally consider it a bit of an edge
case, so not something which belongs in master. But in 3.x plugins can
tie strongly into the whole layouts engine and interface, so
potentially there's scope for a python plugin to handle this.

> 3) Are there any plans to have ‘print once’ pages in composer so that in a layout I could have pages for front matter in ‘print once’ mode, one or more atlas driven pages that will repeat for each atlas area, pages for back matter in 'print once’ mode.

The 3.0 reports functionality should already be able to do that now.

Those are likely to be your original Python 2 files, before the script made
changes, allowing you to roll back. They should definitely not be published,
but you should keep them yourself until you are confident the conversion was
successful.

Hi Antonio,

whilst Nyall is totally right I am still reading here, too. I would 
appreciate if you file a ticket so we can shift the discussion there. 
The stack trace doesn't tell me anything, I am afraid.

thank you

There will probably be a GDAL 2.3.1 release with this 
fix at end of june / july. And assuming OSGeo4W 
catches this, this will be available to QGIS

Hi devs,

should we drop eVis plugin from the codebase? It does not receive any attention
(e.g. bugfixes) for many years, except keeping it compatible with API changes.

Also all its functionality already available in core:
 - with DB Manager we can connect to databases, query them and load results as
new layers
 - with actions it is very easy to open any document from the path stored in the
attribute
 - forms allow to view images from attributes

Any thoughts?

Hi Tom,
Indeed, I should have read the help of the command; it mentions that. Using
a git infrastructure, I was surprised to see backup files as I could do a
reset if things went wrong but I guess the script is intended to be used in
any env.

I'm a strong -1.

If you'd asked me last week, I'd have been a strong +1... but then I
attended a conference where a workflow using evis was demonstrated
which revealed that there's a significant number of users of this
plugin still.

There's actually not that much missing from core which the plugin
offers. I think before we strip it out, we should ensure that its
workflow can be completely reproduced in core, or via a small python
plugin distributed via the normal channels.

Are there slides or maybe video available from this presentation? From
my understanding all functionality provided by the plugin already available
as QGIS core features, but maybe I miss something.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Missing custom rendering properties in QGIS3 Server
Message-ID: <CAPHDReKOL0ugZ97JiAXHjHtM0Qwp6=58-KSzKTrXb2fSmHdBQQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear developers,
i am trying to use the undocumented custom vector layer property
"rendering/renderAboveLabels" in QGIS3 server with no success.

Storing this property in a QGIS project file enables the rendering of
vector layers after the labeling is done. This works fine on QGIS3
desktop, but not on QGIS3 server. I looked into the server code and
realized that the QGS WMS server uses two renderers
(QgsMapRendererParallelJob, QgsMapRendererCustomPainterJob) of which
one (QgsMapRendererParallelJob) should support the custom property.
However, i can not convince the server to apply the custom property
when parallel rendering is enabled.

What am i doing wrong? Are there differences between GQIS3 desktop and
server in handling project files and layer properties?

Why does QgsMapRendererCustomPainterJob not support the custom
property  "rendering/renderAboveLabels"?

Best regards
Soeren

It's undocumented for a reason - it was added as a quick hack to
support this function in very limited circumstances, but isn't part of
the stable or public API as it's not officially supported.

In the long term we need a proper, officially supported and stable way
to handle this use case.

Dear Nyall,
what would be an officially supported and stable implementation?

Are there any plans to implement this functionality in a better way so
it will work in desktop and server?

Can i help to implement this kind of functionality?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Trying to upstream fixes for libdxfrw
Message-ID: <CALFKL5nwYfdo5U-fQDjOyuNuEMSk1HmD2eCj94eHsiqDC1U7+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am a new qgis user. It is great software, please keep up the good work.

I am trying to fix an issue I have in LibreCAD particularly in their
implementation of libdxfrw.

Using LibreCAD and/or libdxfrw's dwg2dxf test binary, upon importing a DWG
file I get an error: "Unable to read tables".

Using qgis Trunk or even the older qgis where libdxfrw was introduced the
dwg file I am working with imports flawlessly.
For reference, it seems to me libdxfrw was introduced to qgis with commit:
a85fe1fa4464e5b6f7bd7e9dbb76c679ec75ec29 on  Dec 14, 2016

I debugged the binary dwg2dxf during the import of a file, but identifying
the issue is more complicated than I would like because there are several
layers of code within the library, and I am not too familiar with the
library.

Setting aside the debugger for the moment, I tried to merge the differences
between the libraries, but this too seems to be too onerous and
error-prone.

I believe the reasons it's difficult to harmonize the code is because the
library itself has been heavily modified, all debug statements have been
swapped for qt debug statements, and the code has been auto-reformatted.

While these changes are good, unfortunately, (for me at least), all these
changes just appeared in the qgis git source tree making it impossible to
bisect the code to the point of origin (libdxfrw upstream), so that I find
find the commit that fixes the issue I am having importing a DWG in
LibreCAD.

Sorry for the essay.

I humbly request, if available and not available online somewhere, a copy
of the git repository used to develop libdxfrw up to the point where it was
introduced in Qgis in 2016 so that I may continue to bisect the code and
find the fix for the DWG that I can't open outside of Qgis.

Thanks regardless,
Vittorio

P.S. If the original git repository is still available it would be great if
placed on Github and possibly even used as a submodule within qgis itself
so as to have the same git tree as upstream for libdxfrw. This would
greatly increase harmonization of source code between the various forks of
libdxfrw and de-duplicate much effort for all parties! I would be willing
to help implement this for you guys if so desired.

Dear developers,

I use expression variables within the rule based renderer. For example:

CASE WHEN @project_title LIKE '%adult' THEN "fclass" = 'school' ELSE
"fclass" = 'kindergarten' END

This works in QGIS desktop but not with QGIS Server Version 2 and 3. Does
QGIS server not support this feature at all? Or do I miss something?

Thanks for any hint

Hi,

after a second try, it seems that QGIS server version 3 supports expression
variables within the rule based renderer - sorry for the noise.

Wow, yes! Exactly this. I can now continue digging around for the fix.

Yeah, I also noticed this. While the Sourceforge repo appears dead, there
has been recent
development for libdxfrw at the following git source trees (amongst others):
https://github.com/rvt/libdxfrw/commits/master
https://github.com/LibreCAD/LibreCAD/commits/master/libraries/libdxfrw/src

Please note: I am not a member of the LibreCAD team, I am just trying to
fix a bug upstream that is affecting me, and noticed that you had fixed it!
Congratulations on your hard work.

Personally, I would choose https://github.com/rvt/libdxfrw as the
"upstream" for this library,
for the following reasons:
1. It contains the entire git source tree, including initial development
from Rallaz, the original
creator of libdxfrw and one of the lead developers of LibreCAD 2.
2. It is already used as a submodule in the upcoming LibreCAD 3.
3. Without too much work from the LibreCAD team it can also be used as a
submodule in LibreCAD 2.
4. It is on Github instead of Sourceforge.
5. It seems to be condoned by Rallaz himself, because the developer, RVT,
is also an administrator
of the SourceForge repo and a member of the LibreCAD team on Github.

In the end it doesn't really matter which git upstream is chosen for the
library, as long as the object ID
of the first commit is the same as the original Sourceforge version. This
tells git that we are talking
about the same source tree. This is not the case in the current Qgis source
tree since libdxfrw
was "forked" from the Qgis source tree.

In my mind, ideally the Qgis project would clone/fork this library, rebase
the Qgis specific modifications
onto the latest upstream version and perform pull-requests for non
qgis-specific fixes.

After this fork is successfully created, it could then be integrated by the
Qgis team as a git submodule
in order to permit merging and re-basing between the various forks of the
libdxfrw project
independently from the Qgis development.

If this is interesting to you, before performing any changes, I would
consult LibreCAD team to make sure
I'm not way off-base and wrong.

I would be willing to help, if so desired, with any of the following:
1. Contacting the LibreCAD team to see if rvt/libdxfrw is going to be their
upstream going forward.
2. Rebase your modifications of libdxfrw onto rvt/libdxfrw source tree and
create the qgis/libdxfrw fork.
3. Try to upstream whatever commit fixes the bug that is affecting me.

Regardless, thank you for the prompt and helpful response,
Vittorio Alfieri

QGIS server in 2.x used an older, deprecated rendering facility, which
had no knowledge of variables and how to set them. Changing this was a
substantial body of work which was completed for 3.0.

(There's basically no fix possible for this in 2.x - the solution is
to use 3.0 here.)

Sorry - to give more info - basically this setting was added as a
hidden option because it was a couple of lines of code change which
works in certain circumstances. Basically you need to be using a map
canvas to render, and must have all the render caching options enabled
(which result in layers being rendered onto separate image surfaces
before compositing them together).

Unfortunately a proper implementation of this, which works across all
of QGIS (including server and print layouts) isn't trivial at all.
(I'd estimate something like 2-4 weeks of development effort). In the
end it comes down to funding - it's a highly desirable feature, and
the only reason it hasn't been done yet is due to the complexity of
the changes. So someone has to sponsor a developer to implement the
changes. Ways you could assist would be:

- approaching QGIS core developers and getting an estimate for the
funds required

- directly sponsor the change

OR

- approach interested organisations and user groups and "co-fund" the changes
- organise a "crowd funding" effort to raise the funds

Hope that helps!

Unfortunately not - but the presenter demonstrated using the next/prev
buttons to scroll through the photos and edit records while they do
that. An easy next/prev button to navigate tables like evis has isn't
something we currently have.

	platforms
Message-ID: <CA+qEb=1vRo6NhXGYwWB4rQDkHNSgEQ6ezFRLF26eyqN3+Q-sxg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Using PyQGIS I load a layout .qpt file, then I access items in the
composition. I do it using

        document = QDomDocument()
        document.setContent(content) # content is .qpt file content
        composition = QgsPrintLayout( QgsProject.instance() )
        composition.loadFromTemplate( document, QgsReadWriteContext() )

        map_item = composition.itemById('main_map')
        map_item.setExtent(canvas.extent())


Now map_item is of type QgsLayoutItemMap while I'm on Ubuntu, but it is
QgsLayoutItem when I use Windows and therefore I receive an error
(QgsLayoutItem does not have setExtent method). Does anybody have an idea
why this happens?

Ubuntu 16.04 x64 + QGIS 3.0.2 with Python 3.5.2 installed last week
Windows 7 x64 + QGIS 3.0.3 with Python 3.6.0 (fresh now from OSGeo
Installer)

Best regards

Hi

It is probably a well known issue with SIP bindings not recognising the object type returned for the layout. A work around is here:

Thanks a lot Tim, I'll give it a try. Looks like it's API 2 workaround and
the issue propagated to API 3 as well?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS 3, the state of Processing and GRASS 7
Message-ID: <582006ef-5575-c424-0ae7-ab03a9d99f2d@vodacomm.ca>

Hello everyone,

for weeks now I have been trying to port standalone PyQGIS code that
makes extensive use of Processing from QGIS 2.18 to QGIS 3. I'm running
3.0.2, the most recent stable version available on Gentoo Linux.

The port was motivated by the need to have code that would work in the
medium term (that was "future ready", so to speak) and the fact that
packages requiring the PyQt4 libraries are being progressively removed
from the package tree of my distribution (for a variety of good
reasons). QGIS 2.x is among them. Maintaining my system in a usable
state while also retaining QGIS 2.x ultimately became untenable.

The porting work is complicated by the lack of meaningful error messages
when calls to external algorithms fail (either it returns with exit code
1 or I get "Unable to execute algorithm"). The only way I have been able
to make any progress at all has been through deep forensic work in the
debugger. This process is very slow when it works at all. I spend
minutes to hours debugging each algorithm call, and then the next one
comes along, fails with similarly uninformative errors, and the process
starts all over again.

For an example of what I am dealing with, have a look at this post on
the qgis-user list:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2018-May/042461.html

(I "fixed" this by editing Grass7Utils.py to replace the call to
Grass7Utils.command with Grass7Utils.grassBin().)

Or consider this bit of code:

>    processing.run("grass7:r.null", {'map': tempbuffer,
>                                      'null': 0,
>                                      'GRASS_REGION_PARAMETER': extent,
>                                      'GRASS_REGION_CELLSIZE_PARAMETER': 0.008333,
>                                      'output': file_buffer},
>                    feedback=QgsProcessingFeedback())

This fails with "Unable to execute algorithm", which is thrown here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/307d082e3de804064a7295aa079ee6cd0e47845a/python/plugins/processing/core/Processing.py#L141

when I step through this method, I end up at

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/307d082e3de804064a7295aa079ee6cd0e47845a/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/Grass7Algorithm.py#L953

The corresponding parameter check in r_null.py is here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/307d082e3de804064a7295aa079ee6cd0e47845a/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/ext/r_null.py#L29

So on *success*, this parameter check returns None, None, which causes
Processing to fail with "Unable to execute algorithm"...

It seems like everyone is working so hard to make QGIS 3 a success, and
I want to contribute to that success by implementing applications using
QGIS 3 and helping test.

But my ported code has to be working by Tuesday or I have to pull the
ripcord on the entire project. The only other possibility I can see at
this point is to revert back to my working 2.x code and establish some
2.x 'island' on which it can run. Honestly, I dread this. How can that
be in the interest of all the QGIS volunteers?

Say you had an project like this that used lots of calls to Processing
and relied on external algorithms from GRASS 7 and SAGA, what would you
do? What approach would you take? What can I do to make this port
successful?

Thanks and regards

Stephen Bosch

	Report
Message-ID: <CAN-PxsyH4Crg18UihXmfSahf-km2dmxyCRY5jU_UJCVjvQLfUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

This is my report for Week 2 (May 21 - May 27):


*What did you get done this week?*

   - Implementation of an initial version of the library for parsing
   description files for QGIS Processing plugin. I solved the problem with
   creating XML files from week 1. [1]
   - Create an independent version of Processing plugin for development. [1]
   - Try to create GUI Integration from generated description UI files from
   initial Python library to Processing plugin [1]

Details can be found in [1].



*What do you plan on doing next week?*

   - Final Python library for parsing descriptions
   - Deep integration of UI descriptions to GUI Processing plugin
   - Split GRASS module parameters in Processing plugin to basic and
   advanced tabs.


*Are you blocked on anything?*
No, at the moment I’m not blocked.

Nice work Radek!

Obviously still very early days, but you seem to be on the right track
so far -- keep it up!

I've been tracking down a performance regression in 3.0 and have
tracked it back to this PR.

What's happening is that in
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrfeatureiterator.cpp#L204
, everytime a new feature is requested with a particular ID the ENTIRE
layer is being read until that feature is found! This destroys QGIS
performance when more than a handful of feature IDs are requested -
e.g. try setting a subset string on a layer, then selecting a couple
of hundred points and zooming to selection.

I've been trying to find a good solution to this without luck - if I
use OGR_L_SetAttributeFilter to specifically request the desired
feature with orig_ogr_fid equal to the requested feature id, then it's
a bit better. There's no longer the need to iterate through all the
features, but it's still very very slow compared to a direct
OGR_L_GetFeature call.

Even do you have any good tricks we could utilise here to speed this
up? Any other pointers for approaches to test?

Regards,
Nyall

Actually - unless I'm missing something, I don't believe that the
whole condition at
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrfeatureiterator.cpp#L204
is even required, because it appears that OGR_L_GetFeature works
correctly with the feature IDs taken from the original fid column. In
other words, when ExecuteSQL is used, we can't safely rely on
OGR_F_GetFID to return a usable feature id and have to use the ogc_fid
attribute value instead... BUT when requesting a feature from the
layer by ID, we CAN safely use OGR_L_GetFeature with IDs taken from
ogc_fid and be confident that we get the desired feature returned.

Is that interpretation correct? If so, this fix is implemented in:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7091

Hi Stephen,

Sorry to hear about your experiences with 3.0 -- they certainly sound
frustrating.

Unfortunately there's no easy answers here. It's a difficult choice
between sticking with the recommended LTR enterprise release 2.18,
which is stable and has had LOTS of testing, versus targeting 3.x and
ensuring code is future proof. Generally the project's advice is for
mission critical applications, stick with 2.18 until the next LTR
release (3.4, later this year). That's why 3.0 has a giant "early
adopter" warning banner on the splash screen.

What I definitely wouldn't recommend doing is targeting 3.0 and not
3.2 -- 3.0 has already seen its final release (3.0.3) and is
effectively end-of-life'd now. So if you decide to target your
application at 3.x, better aim for 3.2 at least.

You're also in the difficult position of relying on the processing
SAGA/grass providers. Unfortunately both these providers are
under-maintained (vs say the native QGIS provider and the GDAL/OGR
provider, which are heavily unit tested and generally very stable). If
you can, I'd always recommend using a native QGIS algorithm or
GDAL/OGR algorithm in place of GRASS or SAGA (for now at least).

So with that said, let's try and resolve your issues...

Definitely a bug - there's a fix and unit test protecting against this
behavior with providers at https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/7095.

Not sure if we can get master in shape by Tuesday (given that 3.2
release isn't still for a couple of weeks), and in any case you'd need
to run master and eventually 3.2 to get these fixes (since 3.0 won't
have any more patch releases). But if you had a bit more breathing
room, I'd like to think we can resolve all your issues before 3.2
final release....

That all makes sense; I had only switched back to 3.0.2 because my
previously working parts of my code had stopped working in 3.1 master; I
felt like I was actually going backwards.

I think the best short-term approach is to try, somehow, to get a
working 2.18 environment on my system and revert to that working code.

The work I've done on the QGIS 3 code isn't lost (I'm using git :) )

Then I can sensibly aim for making it work with 3.2.

You are speaking my language!

My only hesitancy: I haven't thoroughly checked, but I can't be sure
that all the GRASS and SAGA algorithms used here have QGIS and GDAL/OGR
counterparts.

But yes, perhaps the best overall approach is to bet on GDAL/OGR and
native QGIS.

I didn't see much sense in filing a bug report before determining
whether this problem had already been identified :)

Glad to hear I'm not imagining things, though.

As above, let's not abandon the idea of making my project 3.2 compatible!

I will set up an 2.18 environment (if I can do that without totally
breaking my system ;-) ) to take some of the pressure off in the
immediate term.

Cheers

Hi, 

At the 3.0 changelog page (1), if you click on the images, in order to

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Thoughts on using processing models for ETL tasks
Message-ID: <1527502305174-0.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi
I have started looking at using the processing model builder in QGIS 3.0.3
for ETL tasks. A few initial thoughts:

- I would like to be able to resize resize model components, for example to
be able to see the full name of a component.
- Add support for copy/paste of components. If I have spent a few minutes or
more on configuring a algorithm and need an additional copy of it in the
model, copy/paste of the component would save me time.
- Add support for selecting multiple model components by drawing a box.
Also, Ctrl + A should select all components.
- Improved support for undo/redo.
- Add support for grouping components. Different parts of the model might
might have different focus, such as transforming geometries, fixing
attributes or doing calculations. I think it could help usability if I could
group (in a visual box?) or colour the components accordingly. 
- In the tool "Fix geometries", I can´t specify the type of errors to look
for and fix. That would help me understand the errors better.
- I would like be able to add a new algorithm to the model without having to
connect it to the other components directly. I would like to be able to add
an algorith for later consideration.
- Continuing on the previous suggestion, I would like to be able to connect
an unconnected algorithm (already added to the model) using drag and drop.
- I would like to see the number of features flowing through each
connection. That would help me understand the flow and potential errors
better.
- When creating a new model, I often need to run a model quite a few times
to test it. Each time, I have to select input layers manually when starting
the model. Can I make QGIS remember the files I picked the last time?
- If possible, I would like to see OpenCL/CUDA support for algorithms. I
expect some of my tasks to be rather heavy (hours to days) and using the GPU
could potentially speed up the processing a lot.
- For some jobs, I want to zip the model output directly in the model. In
these cases, I might also want to add external files, such as PDF
documentation, to the zip archive. Support for that would be very useful in
corporate environments such as ours.

Should I open a separate ticket for each issue?

Regards,

Magnus

Hi John,
Thanks for sharing your feedback.

I must say I agree with your points, and have some others concerning
database i/o options or a graphical version of refactor field alg.

All this would very nice fit into a QEP so that we can centralize thoughts
and requirements in a more collaborative way than redmine issues.

We should even go a bit further and lead a dedicated group of interest -
like the one Tim is leading for metadata.

However, this is a big task and we'll need a way to leverage ressources,
time and money for leading this.

Regards

Régis

In some ETL there is a concept of context parameters. It allows you to
setup parameters value for different context (dev, int, prod).

This feature could help also in your user case.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Retrieve folder path from Processing scripts
Message-ID: <21b031e0-3b38-df15-435b-7f6b4e9b0b9f@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

I don't know if I'm facing a bug or if I'm missing something. In a
Processing script (or Processing plugin, same same) I cannot not get the
path of the folder when the folder is a Processing parameter:

...
NAME = 'NAME'
FOLDER = 'FOLDER'
...
self.addParameter(QgsProcessingParameterString(
        self.NAME,
        self.tr('My name')))

self.addParameter(QgsProcessingParameterFolderDestination(
        self.FOLDER,
        self.tr('Output folder')))
...
baseName = self.parameterAsString(parameters, self.NAME, context)
directory = self.parameterAsString(parameters, self.FOLDER, context)
basePath = os.path.join(directory, baseName)
feedback.pushDebugInfo(basePath)
return {self.FOLDER: basePath}


I always get a temporary path even when the user choose a folder on the
computer.

Someone else faced this problem?

Thanks for any suggestion!

Just in case someone has similar problem - this workaround has some methods
that probably don't have (or I haven't found them) equivalents in API 3 -
iterating over QgsPrintLayout did return a list of objects and their
correct types, but except for the map. Map item was described as
QgsLayoutItem instead of QgsLayoutItemMap and the only way I found to get
QgsLayoutItemMap object was to use .referenceMap() method. Fortunately I
only use one map per layout project, so it was enough. The workaround works
fine for other types of objects.

Message-ID: <CANaz7mzZBG+3PYWZ1KdrkuhJqakRKAav06Z=X27snDGP5h_JiA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,


just open an issue [1] regarding the (native) Difference algorithm on
Windows for multipoint geometries.

You could replicate it creating one multipoint layer and adding one point
to it. Running the difference algorithm wiith such layer as both input and
difference parameters should return an empty layer, but it doesn't,
returning instead the same input point.

Nonetheless, on GNU/Linux the algorithm works as expected.

Germán

Hi

Does anyone else have a problem compiling 3.0.x with the qgis/qgis3-build-deps:final-3_0_2 base image? It seems like pyrcc is not being invoked by cmake:

-- Up-to-date: /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/db_manager/./sqledit.py
-- Up-to-date: /usr/share/qgis/python/plugins/db_manager/./table_viewer.py
CMake Error at cmake_install.cmake:41 (file):
  file INSTALL cannot find
  "/build/release/python/plugins/db_manager/resources_rc.py”.


If you are compiling using the base image, can you share your cmake config flags?

Thanks

Regards

Tim

Hi Magnus,

Thanks for raising this discussion! I'm also passionate about seeing
QGIS become a first-class ETL tool, and I think that with 3.2 we most
of the underlying building blocks in place. What's needed now is a
bunch of GUI improvements and extra model interaction features (such
as the changes you've described).

I've recently filed for a QGIS funding grant to improve the processing
and modeler GUI, but this is mostly focused on stablising what we have
(as opposed to adding new features), and strengthening it all with
good unit test coverage. (Read more here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puMt5blo1FrIyFRcQDPDAvcOFOPAkxYH17q1OliGs70/edit#heading=h.z5op4p92vp9l
). Unfortunately right now the most fragile parts of processing are
the GUI components (and the external GRASS and SAGA providers -- but
there's work underway to improve that).

Anyway, I'm quite invested in processing and seeing the modeler
improved, so I'd love to be involved in these
discussions/plans/development! Specific comments inline (and links to
existing tickets) below:

What's the specific use case here? There's already a "check validity"
algorithm which exports results including descriptions of the errors
encountered.

Agreed -- I'd also like to see all algorithm parameter validation
deferred, so you could add an algorithm and not enter correct
parameter values up front. This would need to be paired with a "check
model" action - which would scan all the child algorithms and
highlight algorithms which have missing or invalid inputs.

Good idea. Now that you mention it I've also suffered with this in the
past, but just never realised it! Now that you've pointed it out, it's
going to become a mega-annoyance.... thanks.

There was also a grant application filed for this:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puMt5blo1FrIyFRcQDPDAvcOFOPAkxYH17q1OliGs70/edit#heading=h.1do4j282c1w1

I'd be interested to know which algorithms you expect would benefit
from this though.

Great idea. A "compress files" algorithm would be very useful! File a
ticket please.

If I can add some more to this wishlist:

- Add comments to a model: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/14518 .
(Actually I already coded this at
https://github.com/nyalldawson/QGIS/commit/f20a71797, just have never
got the chance to finalize it and add some tests and push to master.
Hopefully for 3.4!)

- Allow reorganizing inputs in models: Currently the model inputs
cannot be manually ordered, which results in quasi-random orders. This
obviously is not ideal, especially when you get linked inputs
appearing in the wrong order (such as a field choice appearing before
the layer choice it's linked to!)

- There's also https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/84,
which is about giving more choices for algorithm parameter inputs in
models (such as expression values evaluated just before that algorithm
is executed). All the backend code for this is hooked up, it's just
missing the GUI to configure.

Maybe related to the GEOS version in use? Could you check what it is
on both platforms (via the about screen).

Hi Tim,

The QGIS image are built using this image as base.
Here is a recent build of 3.0.3
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/jobs/384875814

Here are the lines to build QGIS
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.ci/travis/linux/script.sh#L25-L32

I hope this helps!

Denis

On GNU/Linux:   GEOS v3.5.1-CAPI-1.9.1 r4246

Looking at the GEOS changelog for v3.5.1 there is indeed a fix for
multipoints. However, OSGeo4W stilll offers up to v3.5.0.

I'll keep an eye on such coming update and report back to this list.

Hi devs,

fighting with this problem I might have found a small bug (if someone
can confirm this).

So with `QgsProcessingParameterFolderDestination` and
`parameterAsString` Processing takes the path only if the path is added
manually OR if the user choose the path from the button BUT types
something in the box.

If the path is taken directly from the button I always get a temporary path

If someone wants to give a try I have prepared a copy/paste script for
testing here:

If confirmed I can open a ticket

Thanks

Hi
Nice to hear that there is a lot of interest for improving the processing
environent. I have quite a few additional improvement suggestions that would
be of interest to me and I’m sure that others have a lot of ideas as well.
Obviously, I had already opened more tickets than I could remember and I
have opened a few more, based on Nyalls reply.

Magnus

I can't confirm - what platform are you seeing this on?

Hi

Thanks Denis. I notice travis is not actually doing a make install (which is where my build fails). I have added a bunch of flags from the QGIS/travis build to my recipe, I will post back here if it still does not build.

Hi Tim,

Well, it's doing ninja install
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/.docker/qgis.dockerfile#L43

Not sure how it could be different though!

Hi Nyall,

I'm on a Linux Debian Sid with QGIS master compiled.

I nobody has the same issue then there should be something on my local
machine and that's fine since I know the small workaround ;)

but still weird

Thanks for the reply

Matteo

Maybe a short screencast would help me know if I'm following the same
steps you are?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] PyQGIS: Mixed Polygon/MultiPolygon shapefile
Message-ID: <CAFZgtEiL+nES8QVV1CfVpdz_7xN8Yj50gXuJ27OD68nsY8Xeyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello

My name is Javier Sanchez and I'm the developer of a QGIS based standalone
application to convert Spanish Cadastre data to OpenStreetMap format [1].
I'm trying to port this app from QGIS 2 to 3 and I would like this to work
also with the previous version.

In QGIS 2.x, I was able to write a shapefile with a mixed set of polygons
and multipolygons geometries. Now in QGIS 3.x I can't. Maybe this is a GDAL
issue. Probably the last behaviour is the correct one. But is there any way
in QGIS 3 to create a shapefile mixing polygons with multipolygons?

Here is an example code to illustrate what I meant:

        crs = QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(32628)
        fn = 'xxx.shp'
        w = PolygonLayer.create_shp(fn, crs)
        p = [[QgsPoint(0,0), QgsPoint(1,0), QgsPoint(1,1), QgsPoint(0,0)]]
        mp = [[[QgsPoint(2,0), QgsPoint(3,0), QgsPoint(3,1),
QgsPoint(2,0)]],
              [[QgsPoint(4,0), QgsPoint(5,0), QgsPoint(5,1),
QgsPoint(4,0)]]]
        f1 = QgsFeature(QgsFields())
        g1 = QgsGeometry().fromPolygon(p)
        f1.setGeometry(g1)
        w.addFeature(f1)
        f2 = QgsFeature(QgsFields())
        g2 = QgsGeometry().fromMultiPolygon(mp)
        f2.setGeometry(g2)
        w.addFeature(f2)
        del(w)
        l = QgsVectorLayer(fn, 'test', 'ogr')
        for f in l.getFeatures():
            g = f.geometry()
            print(g.isMultipart())

When I run this in QGIS 2, the output is:

    False
    True

When I run the same example in QGIS 3.x (replacing fromPolygon with
fromPolygonXY and fromMultiPolygon with fromMultiPolygonXY), the output
instead is:

    True
    True

The writer converts g1 from polygon to multipolygon and every geometry in
the resulting shapefile have the same type while before I had a bunch of
multipart and singlepart geometries.

Regards, Javier

Hello Javier,
just force the multipolygon behaviour.
As you say it's a GDAL refinement, just use a Layer Creation Option (-lco).
As per the docs (http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html):

   - *SHPT=type*: Override the type of shapefile created. Can be one of
   NULL for a simple .dbf file with no .shp file, POINT, ARC, POLYGON or
   MULTIPOINT for 2D; POINTZ, ARCZ, POLYGONZ, MULTIPOINTZ or MULTIPATCH for
   3D; POINTM, ARCM, POLYGONM or MULTIPOINTM for measured geometries; and
   POINTZM, ARCZM, POLYGONZM or MULTIPOINTZM for 3D measured geometries. The
   measure support was added in GDAL 2.1. MULTIPATCH files are supported since
   GDAL 2.2.

I think there are consequences, it will be necessary to know if there are
multipolygons in cadastral parcels. This is almost always the case if you
have an entire map, but it could be necessary to scan data or at least to
issue a GDAL_SQL query to detect it.

It seems not related to GEOS version, or at least not only.
On Windows 7 64 bit I can reproduce the bug in QGIS 3.1.0-Master (rev.
310bfb1e3e) with GEOS 3.5.0-CAPI-1.9.0 r4084 but not in QGIS 2.18.19 with
the same GEOS version.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Load layer with style in Processing plugin
Message-ID: <98292e69-8170-d1fb-c1f2-de3066605d2e@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

is it possible to load a layer (vector or raster) created in a
Processing script/algorithm from the script itself without using the
specific algorithm "set style for raster layer"?

I'm using context.addLayerToLoadOnCompletion() to load the layers and I
have a separated function that creates the style (as qml file with the
same name of the layer). But when the layers are loaded the styles
aren't (even if correctly created in the folder and it works if manually
loaded in QGIS).

Thanks for any suggestion

Cheers

Matteo

Message-ID: <CAEEbjBigMBq8iPXX4JhOu0M3kC1htR0fomZ=bhQNMay8_J8XyQ@mail.gmail.com>

I have the impression that when in the main QGis Canvas only a geometry
(with QgsMapTool / QgsVectorLayer) is being changed, only the geometry is
being refreshed and not the underlining Rasters (which have not changed).

I would like to know how this is done since I am working with an adapted
Georeferencer with QgsMapTool / QgsVectorLayer for the points, where when
the Pixel-Point is moved in the Georeferencer-MapCanvas both the geometry
and the Raster are being refreshed, which when multiple points need to be
moved is quite time consuming.

I have looked through the QgisApp, QgsMapTool, QgsMapLayer/QgsVectorLayer
classes but I fail to see what is being done differently.

If an hint could be given where this done, I would be grateful.

Is this within a separate QgsMapCanvas? If so, look into the options:

  QgsMapCanvas::setCachingEnabled()
  QgsMapCanvas::setParallelRenderingEnabled()
  QgsMapCanvas::setMapUpdateInterval();

It might be worthwhile copying the code from
QgisApp::applyDefaultSettingsToCanvas so that the same settings apply
as do for the main canvas.

In QGIS 3.x all features from a line/polygon shapefile are upgraded to
multi* features. This is done for consistency - it means that you can
safely check the WKB geometry type of the layer and be guaranteed that
all geometries from features in that layer will respect the multi or
single geometry type indicated by the layer's geometry type.

Integrating applyDefaultSettingsToCanvas resolved the problem.

However I had to comment the 'setSegmentationTolerance/Type' statements out
since they seemed to have hindered the placement/moving of a point when it
was to near the previous pixel-point.

For a better understanding, I assume that 'CachingEnabled' causes this
effect (Raster not being 'refreshed' but just re-using the existing image,
while redrawing the changed geometry).

BTW: what is the cause of the 'blank' screen effect when the raster is
being refreshed?

Yes - it's listed here: https://issues.qgis.org/issues/16428

If you read through everything this seems to fix it (hopefully it gets 
fixed shortly):

$ cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/PyQt5/uic/widget-plugins
$ sudo mv qgis_customwidgets.py qgis_customwidgets.p

In 3.2 it should be possible, using a subclass of
QgsProcessingLayerPostProcessorInterface and

    context.layerToLoadOnCompletionDetails( output_dest_id
).setPostProcessor( my_layer_post_processor() )

Your QgsProcessingLayerPostProcessorInterface subclass would set the
style for the layer in its postProcessLayer implementation.

This is the canonical, thread safe way to do this in processing... any
other approach (and there's other hacky ways to do this) will not be
thread safe and may crash! We probably should make this a bit easier
and have a direct `context.layerToLoadOnCompletionDetails(
output_dest_id ).setLayerStyle(..... )` call, but it's too late for
3.2....

eheh, sorry too late to test all Processing options (too many of them ;) ).

what you suggested to implement in the future sounds as the smoothest idea.

Thanks again for the hints!

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] i18n for Processing plugins not working
Message-ID: <9b5215f3-2493-40cb-bd31-2068a0e481b2@gmail.com>

Hi devs,

with a simple Processing plugin I'm noticing that the i18n strings are
not taken into account when QGIS is loaded in another language.

Here the steps I'm following:

* using self.tr() to set strings as translatable
* changin the Makefile by adding the new locale and other .py file
containing strings to be translated
* make transupdate to generate the .ts file for each language
* translation the strings with linguist
* make transcompile to compile the ts in qm

even if in the ts file the strings are set to <translated> **without**
the tag <unfinished>, if QGIS is loaded in one of the translated
language, the dialog and all the strings are in the source language and
not in the translated one.

BTW: this seems happen only with Processing plugins and not with default
one.

Should I open a ticket?

Thanks!

Cheers

Matteo

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Can I refresh PostGIS DB connection in pyqgis
Message-ID: <HE1PR02MB1211C8B808B425C01A351D719E630@HE1PR02MB1211.eurprd02.prod.outlook.com>

Dear devs,

When I try to load a layer from a PostGIS data source where the connection has timed out, is there a way in pyqgis (2.18) to refresh the connection programmatically like in DBmanager before loading the layer?

psycopg2 connections are no problem...

The following however:

# Add new layer
uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setConnection(host, port, db_name, user, password)
uri.setDataSource('', query, 'geom','', 'ID')
lyr = QgsVectorLayer(uri.uri(), layer_name, 'postgres')

gives me "No result buffer" error in PostGIS...

Thanks for any hint in advance.

Kind regards,
Stefan

Hi,

The project  is actually on github: https://github.com/3liz/py-qgis-wps

It is fully functional (while still in beta) and we use it actually in our infrastructure.  The project has been presented at the Foss4G.fr and we expect
to talk about it at Foss4G is Dar es Salaam.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] FOSS4G 2018: The Geospatial Event of the Year !
Message-ID: <17D8F779-906F-4EC3-A1DD-D12E86C955CD@kartoza.com>

Hi All. (With apologies for cross posting)

The annual Free and Open Source Software 4 Geospatial <http://foss4g.org/> (FOSS4G) conference is the largest community gathering focused on open source geospatial software. FOSS4G brings together developers, users, decision-makers and observers from a broad spectrum of organizations and fields of operation. Through six days of workshops, presentations, discussions, and code sprints, FOSS4G participants, learn, exchange, and create new collaborations, geospatial products, standards.

FOSS4G is a global conference, with attendees from around the world! Last year, Boston, USA was the host city, before that in 2016 it Bonn, Germany. Now is the time for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania! FOSS4G 2018 will host numerous workshops over 27 - 28 August with exciting keynotes and presentations at the Julius Nyerere International Convention Centre 29 - 31 August, and finally Code Sprints and community building events September 1 & 2. In addition to bringing together the FOSS4G community in Dar, the 21st QGIS Developer meeting <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/wiki/DeveloperMeetingZanzibar2018> will take place in Zanzibar (a short 60min ferry trip away!) the 20 - 24 of August - the Geospatial Savanna is on the rise in East Africa!

The vision for our conference is to make it as accessible and inclusive as possible, bridging the gaps between the various communities that make us so strong, to make us stronger. This will be achieved through a Travel Grant Program that will enable economically disadvantaged participants the opportunity to attend, covering travel, lodging and conference costs. This will be bolstered by an exciting conference program, taking the very best that the open source geospatial community can offer. This ranges from locating schools to the instrumentation of communities with cheap, open source, 3D printed weather stations that improve community resilience to climate change.

Our theme for FOSS4G 2018 is “Leave No-One Behind”. We live in a world where our users and developers have the opportunity to make a difference to the lives of everyone, whether it’s those in extreme poverty looking for access to clean water, to those using routing algorithms to calculate the fastest route to work. Location and geography are at the heart of these challenges and a FOSS4G 2018 in Dar es Salaam will invigorate our existing projects, bringing them to new users and developers while supporting and nurturing the existing community.
To deliver on this mission, we've built collaborations with various communities, from within the open source geospatial community and beyond. For example, in collaborating with Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team <https://www.hotosm.org/>, FOSS4G 2018 will host their annual summit as a track within the main program; collaborating with Understanding Risk: Africa, to focus on the use of open geospatial tools like Geoserver, Geonode, and Inasafe while be bringing users and developers together at an extent not done before. To see the full extent of this exciting program, have a look at the lists of presentations <https://2018.foss4g.org/programme/list-of-presentations/> and workshops <https://2018.foss4g.org/workshop-schedule/>!

Ultimately, you should attend FOSS4G 2018 because:
Dar es Salaam is the centre of technological innovation, culture and social activities in Tanzania;
A vibrant city of many cultures and warm hospitality;
The gateway to African sights, such as world beating safaris, heritage and world leading beaches;
A historic centre surrounded by the construction of a new Africa;
At the centre of East Africa, within easy reach of the world;

Workshop, Main Conference (and experience tickets!) are now available at 2018.foss4g.org <http://2018.foss4g.org/> at the lowest early bird price in years for a global FOSS4G: $500. Early bird registration ends on June 5, book your place today. We're looking forward to welcoming you to Dar es Salaam in the warm Tanzanian sun!


Regards

Tim
