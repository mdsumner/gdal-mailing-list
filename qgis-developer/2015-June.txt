Hello all,

As the links at the bottom of QGIS website pages that help to report and
fix issues seem to work well (I personally have already used them with
success), is it intended to add them at the bottom of QGIS Documentation
pages too?

Yep. Will do that. Ping me if it does not show up soon....

My plan is:
- for docs-testing: do only to github link (as this is not translated)
- for docs-2.8: do only transifex link (as text is not updated regularly)

Hi, 
I could not test SQLITE, maybe debian's package is not default compiled with
it. 
I triple checked postgis rights.. that should do.. I will try to activate
qgis server logs
R?gis

Hi,

Regarding data-defined symbol size:
I noticed that some of my old 2.8x projects display different in QGIS 
master - the symbols that have a data-defined size with a very simple 
CASE WHEN rule display much bigger in QGIS master than in the 2.8x branch.

So I wonder, what exactly has changed in master regarding symbol size 
and why?

Thanks,
Andreas

Nothing in qgis server logs when trying to commit transactions.. I set log
level to 0 and can see every OGC request, but not transactions.
Any idea?

Hi, 
here are the ideas behind this work, Nyall (code reviewer) and Vincent
(author) could explain implentation choices more than me (funder):

- get a more consistent UI with data defined widgets, and not "advanced
fields". That way, size is in one place only.
- offer an assistant on size varying common expression. You will find it at
the bottom of the drop down widget. It computes max value from field or
expression and allows normal user to do what other GIS do.
- That assistant offer legend previsualisation, and generates a legend for
map and composer. I wish we have a legend for any expression...
- During implementation, we understood that symbol size was a multiplication
factor of size varying factor. That implied that it was impossible to
predict final screen size. The new implementation clears that up. 
- offer a size varying graduated renderer, allowing the use of
classifications algorithms
- offer a legend for diagrams (yes!)

IMHO, we need to read previous versions correctly, but that sometimes need
to read all features to retroengineer a size expression. Vincent have
planned to polish that now that feature freeze is made. 

All that needs testing of course. I'm not totally satisfied with the
assistant shortcut, hidden inside the size varying widget. If someone have a
better UI idea.. 

Hope that helps clarifying those changes. 
Cheers
R?gis

?I just tested the assistant for the first time and it's just great! Will
definitely test some more and report back.
Thanks for your work on this!?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Failing tests
Message-ID: <556CB15D.3060606@opengis.ch>

Hi,

For more than a week already we have failing tests on master
https://travis-ci.org/qgis/QGIS/builds

This basically renders the whole test suite a lot less usable.

Some examples/thoughts:

 * Every pull request fails tests [1] I often look at the test results
to check if it's even worth looking at a pull request. Handling pull
requests is an issue on its own as there is no direct benefit for the
reviewer most of the time. Don't make the reviewer's time even harder!

 * We don't see when a commit trashes our compiler. Today we had a
commit which broke the compiler. The author was not informed by mail.

 * We don't see which commit broke a certain test. E.g. At the moment
the PyQgsAppStartup test is failing. And to find out which commit broke
it one has to dig deep because failing of this test is masked by the
already failing tests.

 * It discourages people to write tests if they can be broken easily.

The tests started to fail with the merge of some big work, just previous
to feature freeze. I can understand that people want to get commits into
master before feature freeze. But quality should not suffer from this.
And if there's something broken, please fix it fast.

Finally Nyall was starting to fix things - crucial GIS functionality
like splitting features - although I don't think he received anything in
return, thank you very much, Nyall. The one thing left to do is to add
doxygen API documentation - and to fix the newly broken PyQgsAppStartup
test. I really hope we will finally see the green light again.

I am a hippy. I don't like rules and policies. I am not in favor of a
very strong policy concerning the tests. Common sense should be valued
more than rules. Policies like "every new feature has to come with a
test" are no good solution as they encourage people to write silly
tests. And I am much too lazy to write a QEP for a policy to revert
commits which break the tests.

So... How do we fix it?
If tomorrow everybody on this list writes some API documentation we
should have fixed that test by noon.
And then I'll promise I'll fix the failing PyQgsAppStartup test to get
the green light going again.

Thank you very much
Matthias

I can only wholeheartedly second Matthias? message above - we should never push to master if the tests don?t pass, and if for some reason they break we should not push anything more to master before the break is fixed.

Tim

I'm currently looking at how to fix PyQgsAppStartup but at the moment I'm
not sure why it is failing given that it works on the command line
normally.

Doc tests pass now... just the startup one left to repair.

I'd be in favour of a hardline "no breaks allowed" approached. You
break travis, your commit gets reverted. We shouldn't be allowing
intentional regressions, and if the test itself is broken then this
should be fixed before the failing commit is pushed to master.

A general rule doesn't make sense to me - it depends on the break.
If you break travis, you should fix it.

For the record, can you elaborate which types of breaks should not be
fixed and/or why certain breaks should be fixed in master instead of in
a separate branch/pull request?

I'm all for strict unit test policy however they need to be able to run on
all platforms consistently in order to enforce that correctly.  Taking the
failing PyQgsAppStartup test on Travis, i just ran it on my Linux setup and
it passes fine, yet fails on Travis.  I'm skeptical of that test anyway but
it does make it hard to fix when it can't be reproduced..

Compare to Traivs I get these two tests failing:

The following tests FAILED:
100 - PyQgsLocalServer (Failed)
134 - PyQgsPalLabelingServer (Failed)

Disabling a test is also a legitimate course of action - if the test does not run as expected and there is no reasonable way to see why in python you can tag it as ?expected failure? using the expectedFailure decorator. Obviously that should not be the default action when a test fails and should not be used to disable tests in masse, but disabling the test puts travis back into a testable state for other dev while you figure out the reason for the regression.

Hi,

Thanks for explaining. The assistant is very nice and a welcome 
improvement! Thanks for investing and working on it.

I had an issue that I had a size defined in 2.8.x with "scaling by area" 
which, when opened in QGIS master displayed much bigger. Once I changed 
that in 2.8x to "scale by diameter" the symbol sizes are identical in 
master.

So there seems to be an issue with converting "scale by area" symbol 
sizes from 2.8 over to QGIS master.

Should I open a bug report or is one open already?

Thanks,
Andreas

I found another issue with the new scaling method:

For multi level point symbols we need to be able to define the scaling 
on the symbol level. However, when adding it on the symbol level, the 
same rule applies both on the parent marker and on the individual symbol 
level.

What if one part of the symbol should be scaled differently than the 
other? We really need this to work on the indivual symbol levels, not on 
the parent marker - or at least make it optional that it scales the 
parent as well.

As it works currently, I get a very different rendering in the map, 
compared to the preview in the legend ;-(

Huh?  I didn't say breaks shouldn't be fixed.  I said just the opposite.  But I
said the fix should not not generally be a simple revert.

Hi

The green lamp is going again!

Thanks a lot to everybody committing documentation updates, fixing tests
and providing inputs for the failing QgsAppStartup test.

I just disabled part of this test to have the CI running again. It's a
rather hard-to-debug test since it runs in a subprocess. But this test
prevented me once from breaking the python initialization code, so it
would be good to be able to re-enable it.

Does that more translate to:

 * If the test fails for an unrelated reason: fix the test or disable it
 * If the test fails for a good reason and it's a simple fix: fix the
code instead of reverting
 * If none of the above applies: revert the commit

All that should be done in a reasonable time.

We should still be able to decide based on particular situations and not
just blindly stick to these rules.
But some kind of reaction would be good because in the current situation
it somebody else needed to step in to fix the code and documentation.
And I think that this should be the original committers responsibility.

Hi all.
Is it feasible to run a Processing model calculation of the type:
A*B*C
where A and B are two rasters, and C is a constant, to be input by the
user? I cannot find an easy way now - maybe I'm just tired?
Thanks for any suggestion.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjP-o0SZFjaPG0VE5gJ52nvQKu0M1r9pw5BaaTvWiGhMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Marco (also cc-ing dev list)

I've been looking over the new geometry engine and it's really nice
stuff. It's fantastic to have this in QGIS and it's a huge improvement
over the old geometry class. Thank you!

I have a couple of questions regarding this which I'm hoping you can
clarify for me. Firstly, I *think* that there's an issue with the
inheritance of some of the classes. Specifically QgsMultiLineStringV2
and QgsMultiPolygonV2. Currently both of these derive from
QgsGeometryCollectionV2, but I think they should derive from
QgsMultiCurveV2 and QgsMultiSurfaceV2. This would seem logical to me
since QgsLineStringV2 derives from QgsCurveV2 and QgsPolygonV2 derives
from QgsCurvePolygonV2. It also would match with how I understand the
OGC simple features access specification describes (see 6.1.8.1 -
MultiCurve should be non-instantiable, 6.1.9 multiline is a
multicurve, and 6.1.13.1 and 6.1.14 for the corresponding
multisurface/multipolygon types). What's your thoughts?

Secondly, are you able to share your plans for bug fixing leading up
to 2.10? There's a number of serious regressions following this work,
and I'm wondering if I should be focusing on these during the
sponsored bug fixing or whether you plan to tackle them before
release? The biggest issues I see are:
- #12836 : layers fail to render
- unfiled: I get a lot of unknown exceptions when working with
geometries. I can reproduce this consistently by trying to use the
reshape tool on a polygon, or by rotating a map within the canvas or a
composer.
- #12843: simplify tool broken
- i noticed there's also a number of stubbed methods in geometry with
todo comments (eg QgsGeometry::buffer ).

If you can share your plans then I can plan my work accordingly.

Again, thanks again for this fantastic work!

Hi all,
may I ask bug fixers to mark (e.g. with [BACKPORTED] all the commits
that fix a bug *and* backport it to LTR? In this way it will become
immediately obvious which ones will go to 2.8.3 and which will require 2.10.
Thanks.

Hi Paolo

I've been thinking about this... Do you think it's worthwhile to hold off
on back porting 2.10 freeze fixes until after release? That way we get
extra testing of these before they get backported.

I was thinking that a week or so after 2.10 we could sweep through all the
fixes committed and backport any with this [backport] tag...

IMHO this should be judgemed by the dev who do the fix. In any case, we
have a 2-weeks period of observation for fixes on LTR branch, hopefully
this will be enough to spot further problems.

Hi Nyall

Thanks for your input. I'll back in the office tomorrow and can give you 
more detailed answers to the technical questions.

To the technical issues:
Yes, I plan to fix them in the next time, but definitely before release 
( fixed #12857 and started to look at #12836 already). I think you 
should focus on other bugs, otherwise we risk to do the same work twice.

Regards,
Marco

The problem I see is by requiring [BACKPORTED] tag in the commit
to master you're basically preventing to test fixes in master branch
before deciding if it's safe or not to backport.

I saw Jurgen referencing the commit identifier of the master branch
in the backporting commit, and I followed that habit as in that way
you can tell if a commit was backported by 'git log --grep'ing for
the commit of interest. For example (try these in 2.8 branch):
 
  git log --grep=431dc142
  git log --grep=9c5cbd4

Hi Sandro,
I see your point. My aim was to give "normal" users an easy way of
discovering whether they can expect a fix in the next LTR release, or if
they have to head for next release.
All the best.

I think "normal" users should refer to the ticket for the bug they
are interested about. That one should be the source of all information.
It'd be surely the easiest one to get to (and users should be encouraged
to look for tickets and file them if not present, about their bugs).

Then we'd be back to finding a good way to encode which branches
got the fix. So far I think the agreement was to have "Target Version"
set to the oldest version containing the fix, so if you read "2.10"
as "Target Version", that means "2.8" will not have the fix, unless
some other step is taken. Now it'd be nice if the code that automatically
closes tickets reading commit logs (is it a standard redmine plugin ? or
is it code some qgis developer wrote?) could also derive from the
branch name whether or not the "Traget Version" should be updated.

The ticket system sounds like a good place to manage this information.
In comparison to the commit in master the ticket can be altered later
on. And is referenced from the commit in master if that's the starting
point of the search.
Further it has a nice box showing commits including messages which
relate to that ticket. So if the commit message says "backported to
2.8.3" all the information is there. And it's a minimal effort for the
developer.

What do you think?

The log of the backporting commit, you mean ?

Isn't the information possibly derivable from the branch name ?
Not specifying anything would be the minimum possible effort for

`git branch --contains {sha}` should return release-2_8 for a backported
commit.
But I have no idea how this plugin works and who maintains it :)

Agreed, better on tickets than on git.
Antway, this is an important info, if we want to be serious about LTR.
Thanks.

Only if the commit was "merged". Does not work with cherry-picked or otherwise
rebased commits (very frequent, and personally I prefer those).

> But I have no idea how this plugin works and who maintains it :)

Whatever the plugin does, it necessarely fetch commits of all branches
(or it would not be able to find out about cherry-picked commits in the
stable branch). 

Right now the user should have all the info, as long as the commit log
references the ticket. And the redmine plugin would also have them all,
so there's no need to ask developers to do anything more than referencing
the ticket (thus the importance, IMHO, to _require_ tickets exist for any
commits into the stable branch).

Hi,

I noticed that my problem with the invalid scaling only occurs if I use 
layers from old QGIS versions (2.8). If I create a new layer with new 
symbology, this works fine. So, definitely a migration issue from old 
project versions, esp. if "scale by area" was active.

Thanks,
Andreas

The master's commit hash not. But at the time that one is pushed to the
repository and hence evaluated by the plugin hook we don't know if it's
backported.
However, if you leave the "Fixes #XXXX" message in place it will
generate a new hash when backported (cherry-picked), which will be
linked in the ticket as well and return release-2_8 when evaluated by
the tracker.
The downside of this approach is that we do know that it's fixed in
release-2_8 but not in which point release. So if I fix something today
it says "fixed in 2.8" but to be precise it should say "fixed in 2.8.3".

We could also go the other way and take the release-2_8 branch history
as canonical source for fixes/Changelog.

That would be
 * 100% accurate
 * Contain information about the fix
 * Have a link to the ticket if one exists.

For me the two things are different:

 * The changelog (with fixes that *may* have a ticket attached)
 * The ticket that should contain information about on which branches it
has been resolved

True, we don't know about the future (who does?).
What we can know, though, is which release came out from that branch last:

 $ git describe
 final-2_8_2-9-gea447e7

So, 2.8.2 was the latest, and "we" (a plugin?) may assume 2.8.3 will be
the next.

I don't like the version in the commit log because if you further
cherry-pick that commit in another branch it brings with it the target
version info which doesn't really belong to the change. In postgis I often
cherry-pick commits from svn-trunk to svn-21 to svn-20 ...

That's surely the most detailed and correct info.

Agreed. So back to Paolo's request:

I think "normal user" refer to "a fix" by looking at a ticket,
so this whole discussion should be about making retriving the info
from the ticket easier.

For sure the first step is _ensuring_ that any fix has a ticket.
Then, the ticket should allow containing information about versions
in which the fix was committed. Either using the existing "Target Version"
field (which would need to be turned into an array or represent the "Minimum
Target Version"), or adding a new field.

I don't open tickets for bugs which I fixed and found no ticket. I am
too lazy.
I'd rather have a solution that merges the commit log and the ticket
information into a single, good-looking changelog.

hi Alexander and Nyall, hi all,
if possible, I'm interested in understanding which kind of stats you are planning to include in core.
Indeed, here I'm looking for someone who can help me to update SDA4PP plugin and, in case, avoid to duplicate the efforts.

Is there also an idea about optimizing geo-statistics tools? like merging the two "interpolation" tools, or those connected to DEM analyses and geomorphological analyses  within raster menu or adding new features?

Thank you in advance.

All the best,

Niccol?

Yes, in the ISO and OGC models, MultiPolygon inherits from MultiSurface 
and MultiLineString from MultiCurve. The implementation of the 
geometryV2 classes differs a bit compared to the model, because most 
methods are implemented on GeometryCollection level (e.g. in the ISO 
model, length() and area() are not in the collection class). So there is 
little practical relevance if QgsMultiPolygon is derived from 
MultiSurface (and overwrites all its methods) or from 
GeometryCollection. One exception is the segmentize() method. By default 
(straight geometries), this is equal to a normal clone(). As 
MultiSurface needs to overwrite it (may contain curved geometries), 
MultiPolygon would need to overwrite it again with the default behaviour 
if it was derived from MultiSurface.

 >MultiCurve should be non-instantiable

In the OGC model, it is non-instantiable. In the ISO model (which is 
relevant here), it is left to the implementation if it is instantiable 
or not.

Regards,
Marco

Subject: [Qgis-developer] isSelected expression operator - Request for
	comments
Message-ID: <CAFO80_poPXYC6gD8S4fU=EXuAo1iH2Kho8qPSmqgMXGWUtJb-Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi at all,

I just added a feature request: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/12879
regarding adding a isSelected (or something else) operator in the
expression editor.

I ask the community to comment this request to find the best solution.

the idea in the request is here reproduced:

Many times, I received the request to have a smart styling for
selected features.
The main reason is to have a "smart" visualization of selected feature
is in case of:
* they are too crowded
* if would be necessary to have a special style for selected feature
(e.g. highlight the selected and blur the others)

In this moment styling of selected feature is:
1) limited to color and transparency setting
2) can be styled adding custom function that retrieve if the feature is selected

the solution 1, obviously, does not satisfy requirement
the solution 2 has two drawback:
A) the custom function have to know the layer id (blocked in the
expression) to get selected features and check if the current feature
is selected or not
B) the loop described in A is really time consuming with a large
amount of features

during Nodebo, Andreas and Nyall confirmed that there is no other way
to style selected features

How to solve technically:
I asked to Martin if were possible to add some kind of "contextual"
operator that allow the feature knows at what layer it belongs to (and
something more)... Martin said that, going up to the layer data (not
thread safe), could introduce problems during MT rendering.
He points out that "is selected" state of the feature is already
available to the feature, and it should only be published.
He suggested to ask to Nyall to integrate this feature because he is
was working on styling in that moment (for 2.10)
Nyall pointed out that this feature can be added after 2.10 because we
were too near feature freeze, so it could be added for 2.12 and 2.11
dev version for testing.

this is the state of the art. regarding a sophisticated way to style
selected features

regards,

Luigi Pirelli

Hi Niccol?,
I believe the general idea is to consolidate all analyses in the
Processing plugin.

The marker size/rotation expression don' not actually exists, like the
marker size/rotation.

You can define different size/rotation expressions at the symbol level.
Each symbol can have it's own variation.

It's only in the particular case where the scale/rotation expressions of
all symbols composing a marker preserve the aspect ratio of the symbol
that it is recognized as a marker expression and displayed as such.

Message-ID: <CAFcOn2_+vTym1YqC4vusM+SFP_Dt6Kf5Mg-FA73CnLWmZB7XDA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Can somebody explain, if there is a problem when GeoPackage is being
added as writable driver (see also this feature request [1])?

I'm not sure but it seems that it's mainly inserting following snippet
to "core/qgsvectorfilewriter.cpp", specifially
"QgsVectorFileWriter::driverMetadata", after line 2272 [2]:

  else if ( driverName.startsWith( "GeoPackage" ) )
  {
    longName = "GeoPackage";
    trLongName = QObject::tr( "GeoPackage" );
    glob = "*.gpkg";
    ext = "gpkg";
  }

Yours, S.

That would be a very good addition (assuming it works as expected)! Please make a pull request with your proposed change.

Hi Victor,

Thanks - sounds good.

Will do, once I tested.

I have one more big problem:

This mechanism - for some reasons I don't know yet - does not work on 
QGIS server. All the symbols that are correctly scaled on QGIS desktop 
are displayed small and of the same size on QGIS server (yes, I am using 
the latest version of QGIS server). It seems that the expressions are 
not evaluated on QGIS server, but just the initial standard size is used 
instead of the impression.

See 
http://webgis.uster.ch/temp/qgis_server_rendering_problem_symbol_scaling.png 
(left QGIS desktop, right QGIS server)

Can you confirm that this is the case? And if yes, can we do something 
about it?

It would be a pity - because I always tell people they get the exact 
same rendering between Server and Desktop ...

If confirmed, I will open a bug report.

Thanks a lot for your work!

Andreas

I think so, therefore assigned the tickets to me.

Hi Marco,

I added another  bug which I suppose could be related to the geometry
redesign.
I assume it's an uncaught exception but I did not look into it in detail.
Would be great if you could also have a look.

Hi Tim and Even

Thanks for your answers and input!
Seems to work! https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2114
Yay!
I've tested it with a point, linestring and polygon layer containing >
2500 features

Should I add something to some test suite? If yes, what?

Cheers, S.

Good catch Andreas!
 I was also convinced that rendering was the same in server and desktop. If
not, we will have to know why and deploy unit tests for that..

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Writing layer w/ custom CRS to Spatialite Database
Message-ID: <947B4068-D762-4900-8E23-34639DD786B2@nd.gov>

Hi All,

Is it possible to write a layer w/ a custom CRS to a spatialite database with pyQgis?  Here?s what I?ve tried:

1) create an empty spatialite database

2) add custom QGIS crs to spatial_ref_sys table in spatialite database using the following sql command:

sql = """INSERT INTO spatial_ref_sys(srid, auth_name, auth_srid, ref_sys_name, proj4text, srtext) VALUES({0}, '', '', '{3}', '{1}', '{2}')""".format(layer.crs().authid()[5:], layer.crs().toProj4(), layer.crs().toWkt(), layer.crs().description())

3) write layer to database using the following:
def loadVectorsIntoDB(layers, dbase):
#database import options
options = {}
options['overwrite'] = True
options['forceSinglePartGeometryType'] = True
uri = QgsDataSourceURI()
uri.setDatabase(dbase)
for layer in layers:
uri.setDataSource('',layer.name(),'the_geom')
ret, errMsg = QgsVectorLayerImport.importLayer(layer, uri.uri(), 'spatialite', layer.crs(), False, False, options)
del uri

The layer will be written to the database, but it is imported with an srid of 0 which is an Undefined - Geographic Long/Lat coordinate system, not the custom CRS.

I have also tried to write a layer using DB manager instead of step 3 and got the same result.  Is it possible to add the CRS to the spatial_ref_sys table in such a way it will match the  layer.crs() argument in the QgsVectorLayerImport.importLayer() function?

Any hints would be great!

Thanks,

Mitch

OK, so I have found the documentation which says I should use QSettings(),
which is clear enough, and I can read settings in fine. However, if I want
my plugin settings to persist transparently (ie the user should not have to
save the settings explicitly), where in the plugin should I put all my
QSettings().value("key", "value") statements?

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_EHdyWGUmK7S98=fE5Spenmo4O-bJj6q8xMH=iJdSqLhA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm still at 2.8.1 (I have no administrator permissions on this machine)

Using data-defined override on a marker symbol does not seem to be working
as it should. Comparing a layer where the marker size is set to 50 and
another where we use 50 as an expression in data-defined override, they do
not look the same, and I guess they should.

Can anyone can confirm this, whether in 2.8 or in master?

Thanks,

Not sure if it is the best way, but actually whenever the user changes
something (by clicking or inputting something) you can 'save' it to
settings.

As an example:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/featuregridcreator/blob/master/FeatureGridCreator/grid_creator.py#L173

I create two helper functions to set and get settings value (and make it
possible to return a default value in case setting is not set).

and all the getter setter's are used when the user clicks (changes)
something in the dialog. So the settings are being constantly in sync
with the user latest choices...

But there are probably other ways too :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

I plan to start working on it on monday (I am hiking up some volcano here in Indonesia this week, so that last statement assumes no eruption takes place during the hike :-P).

Yes - oh and last release we aliased the site to http://changelog.qgis.org

I made a place holder version here 

http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.10/

If folks would like to start emailing me (or adding directly to the changelog if you have permissions) with suggestions for the changeling, feel free to do so. Please use the word ?[CHANGELOG]? in your email subject so I can filter out the requests easily, and include any sponsor  details and links as needed (use the previous changeling as a guideline).

Regards

Tim

?Confirmed in 2.8.2 (Nightly OSGeo4W): data-defined size 5 is much smaller
than normally configured 5.

This problem seems fixed in master though.

Hi list,

I'm using qgis-server 2.8.2 on Ubuntu 14.04 with qgis-web-client, but i

If a try with same layer but inside PostgreSql, every things work.

Someone have an idea about this behavior? Why on shape files 
GetFeatureInfo call with Filter not works?

Message-ID: <CAMMN2u3LJ46JmqLT08b=i2C5v5FFzk62+GdPZCdEsgcCkj5rsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,
again I have some trouble when compiling qgis. This is the output:

make[2]: *** No rule to make target '/usr/lib/libproj.so', needed by
'output/lib/libqgis_core.so.2.9.0'.  Stop.
CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1116: recipe for target
'src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all' failed
make[1]: *** [src/core/CMakeFiles/qgis_core.dir/all] Error 2
Makefile:147: recipe for target 'all' failed
make: *** [all] Error 2


Also without compiling, I'm not able to start qgis (master or 2.8), I
receive the following error:

/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS-master/build28/output/bin/qgis: error while
loading shared libraries: libproj.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No
such file or directory


Is there a problem with libproj, but I have the libproj-dev package
installed on my computer (debian testing).

Any help is appreciated!

Cheers

Matteo

Hi!

Did you try a "make clean" in between?
How is the Makefile produced? cmake ? ccmake? Can you take a look
where PROJ_INCLUDE_DIR and PROJ_LIBRARY point to?

Where on your system is "libproj.so.0" located?

regards
Werner

Hi Werner,
thanks for the answer!

yep, I made a make clean, this is the small bash script I use to compile:

#!/bin/bash
cd ~/lavori/QGIS-master
git checkout master
git pull
cd build
make clean && make

I also tried to add the nightly repository and install the master version
from there but I get the following error:

qgis:
Depends: libproj0 (>=4.8.0) but it is not installable
... many others dependencies

In fact, the libproj0 is not available for debian testing:

sudo aptitude install libproj0
No candidate version found for libproj0
No candidate version found for libproj0

I cannot find the related package in the internet for a manual download and
installation.. Someone else experienced the same problem?

Cheers

Matteo

He runs Debian testing, which ships proj 4.9.1 (libproj.so.9) since a
few weeks.

With the update to 4.9.1 the library moved to Multi-Arch directories,
so: /usr/lib/<triplet>/libproj.so.9

The errors are about the old paths for proj 4.8.0, and that's no
longer available in Debian testing. Rebuilding qgis with the proj
4.9.0 (with libproj-dev installed) should just work, it helps to
always build in a clean cowbuilder chroot.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Sebastiaan,
thanks for your help.
I checked and I have libproj9 already installed.

So what exacly should I do? Should I re-run ccmake in order to have another
list of all the paths?

Thanks!

Matteo

Throw away your old build directory, recreate it and run `cmake ..`
from inside it.

Hi Sebastiaan,
thanks!
So, in simple words, I can delete the QGIS git cloned directory, re-clone
it, create a new build directory and run a new ccmake. Right?!

Cheers

Matteo

Hi!

No need to delete the cloned QGIS repository - just "clean" the build
directory ..

(or remove the build directory and create it again)

That should be enough to help you getting started again...

regards
Werner

Thanks, Richard. That would work perfectly, but my UI is mostly QTreeWidgetItem elements. Apparently, those don't emit valueChanged signals, so I can't use your code (unless I've got that wrong). I therefore either have to find some other signal I can hook into, or save the settings at some other point. Any ideas?

Not sure if it is the best way, but actually whenever the user changes
something (by clicking or inputting something) you can 'save' it to
settings.

As an example:

https://github.com/rduivenvoorde/featuregridcreator/blob/master/FeatureGridCreator/grid_creator.py#L173

I create two helper functions to set and get settings value (and make it
possible to return a default value in case setting is not set).

and all the getter setter's are used when the user clicks (changes)
something in the dialog. So the settings are being constantly in sync
with the user latest choices...

But there are probably other ways too :-)

Richard Duivenvoorde

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to ship help with a plugin which adds algs to
	Processing?
Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fi-ji_2F1TttP-2OtRsVrPW0LJX1Vq6US2P0vw-wtKohQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm wondering how I can ship help for the algorithms which my plugin adds
to Processing. Currently, the help tab only displays:

The requested URL /testing/en/docs/user_manual/xxx/xxx.html was not found
on this server.

Is there a way to ship my help with the plugin or does it have to be
included in the user manual?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Hi!

I'd like to add LiDAR file import support to a tool I'm writing, but the
laslib and laszip libraries are LGPL, which is an issue for me because I
target OSs where dynamic libraries are not always possible.

Do you know of any MIT (or similar) licensed lib capable of reading LiDAR
1.3 files in LAS and LAZ format?

Thanks!

Hi

I'm running into this issue: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/11399

Could this be a solution? https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-40449

Since 2.10 is coming soon, it would be great to have a solution. I'm using
QGIS master on Yosemite built with homebrew.

best regards

Stefan,

I looked into this, but it's non trivial. We need to wait until the osx
builds switch to qt5 before this issue will be fixed.

Or I want to see which bugs had been closed during 2.9 development/bug

this should be fixed in latest master and also in the Processing

this has been fixed during the Danish HF for the master branch.
Are you working with 2.8.2?

* QT_Polar libraries.. I set them to OFF as suggsted in a post (else, the
compilation would not start), but, during the compilation I get this error:


In file included from
/home/ma7730/lavori/QGIS-master/src/app/qgisapp.cpp:139:0:

                            ^
compilation terminated.

What can I do?

Thanks!

Hi,





When
trying to create help files for custom Processing
models using the help editor, the entered
information is not saved and everything is lost on
closing the dialog.





If
you can confirm, I can open a ticket.





Thanks
and best wishes,

Anita

Hi,

You can overwrite the help function of your GeoAlgorithm.
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/core/GeoAlgorithm.py#L106
It works in my plugin.

Hi Matteo,

You can leave QWT-Polar on.
There are two different switches.

WITH_QWT_POLAR and
WITH_INTERNAL_QWT_POLAR

If you set both of them to ON QGIS takes the included qwt libraries
for compilation.
There was a discussion at some point the remove internal qwt libraries
from the source but as for e.g. debian has no qwt package it is still
necessary to include it.

Hope this helps in compiling with qwt support.

kind regards
Werner

Message-ID: <55747D1C.5050906@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I had a crash on an entire classroom, all on Windows, running the plugin
Statist (I assume when running matplotlib). Unfortunately I have no
longer access to the class, so I cannot investigate further: could
anyone confirm it is not a local issue?
Thanks.

Message-ID: <55748498.6060108@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
The recent changes in Processing solved a number of issues - in general
I think it is now more polished and  usable.
One thing I did not understand, however, is why the log has disappeared
fro the History box. I may be missing something, but I believe having
the possibility of going back to the outputs from several backends was a
very useful feature.
Is there a good reason not to put it back?
All the best, and thanks.

?+1 for keeping the algorithm log.

I think we were talking about maybe clearing the error log after a restart.
The algorithm log should not be discarded so easily since it is very
helpful to be able to go back and check previously used settings even if
QGIS was closed in between.

Best wishes,
Anita

+1 how it is now, Processing is a core plugin and any core
functionality should to show logs
on the same place and I think the message logs widget of QGIS is the
right place, imho.

You still have the same output as before. Everything that was logged
into the Processing log is now in a "Processing" tab in the QGIS log.

The only thing left in the sepoarate Processing history are the
executed commands, since that is an interactive log (you can double
click on a history entry to re-run the alg) and that cannot be
implemented in the QGIS log

So, in short, you have the same info, just with a more coherent
structure for a core plugin, as it was mentioned before

Cheers

Hi Victor,
thanks for clarifying. The current approach makes a lot of sense;
however, I believe Processing is a special case, in which it is rather
common for an user to want to save all the output for future reference
and inspection. Selecting all, copying and pasting to a file is quite
impractical. Perhaps better to add an option to flush all the output to
a file?
All the best.

Is the size-scale method set to Diameter ? If it's not the case (i.e.
scale method area), then a square root is applied if the size is defined
by an expression.

It's left on default. So probably area. It's not clear for the user that
there is a connection between this seeing and data defined size.

You are right, setting size-scale to diameter, makes it work.

Not sure if data-defined override for Symbol Size should even be connected
to the size-scale method, since in this case it should simply override the
symbol size value.

Setting a value directly on the Symbols Size input box won't take in
consideration the size-scale method (it always use diameter).

Don't know if this is now more consistent in 2.9.

Thanks for looking at this,

Alexandre

In master UI refactoring, area or diameter selector disappeared, and we now
have an assistant for that. 
Expressions directly typed refer to size (diameter) and are no more
influence by this modifier. 

I think we should rename 'assistant' by 'size assistant' so that users see
that more easily, and maybe put it in bold font.  I'm afraid that they won't
see that tool because they are very used to this widget.
Thoughts? 

Cheers

Message-ID: <CAMtDFL+1RqbzRxWripJcybzrrt2gh4zbAGQOEW-4pzu90mM1jw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm working on a plugin and I need to use my own model inside.
I know how to add a new algorithm in processing but I didn't find something
on how to add a model to processing.

Is there a way to ship my model with the plugin ?
Or do I need to copy manually my model into the processing models folder
with Python ?

I saw the ModelerAlgorithmProvider (like the AlgorithmProvider) but I not
sure if I can do what I want with it.


Thanks,
Etienne

I agree - a rename to "size assistant" or "sizing assistant" would be 
useful. In my opinion, the new solution is not harder to find than the 
old solution - which was pretty hard to find and even more disconnected 
to the actual symbol than the new solution. I agree, it is still a bit 
hidden, but it belongs to the expression - that's why the current 
solution isn't bad.

You can use the instance of ModelerAlgorithmProvider that is stored in
the Processing object.

Like this:

model = ModelerAlgorithm.fromFile("Path/to/your/model/file")
model.provider = Processing.modeler
Processing.modeler.algs.append(model)

That will add your model to the list of available ones

I guess you are the first one asking for this...and this is the best
solution i can think of so far :-)

Let me know if that works...

I hope it helps

Hi all,
loading a large table requires the loading of all records. This is a
real performance killer, and effectively prevents the use of layers with
millions of records. Not a new issue, I know, but: is there anyone
working, or planning to, in order to improve this situation? Is there a
workaround?
All the best, and thanks.

Moreover, even when selection Show only selected in Options, and
selecting a few records, apparently all records are read, so this does
not speed up.

I've been rooting around in the API, but haven't managed to find it.

	updating with auto form
Message-ID: <CAFcOn2_wjOwg8jhR6ksahVEGQVJJeybVGSOu+OTR_r9RGBgv=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have a layer of "Memory storage" type (Memory provider) which I
created with Python.
When editing=on and updating values using the attribute table
interactively everything works as expected, i.e. the record get's
updated.
Then I'm checking "Auto open form" to on.
Now, when updating the object interactively using the "Identify
Features" tool the auto form opens as expected.
But after saving, the record get's duplicated and sorted to the end.
So I end up with two records having the same values (incl. id etc.),
one remaining an unchanged duplicate, the other containing the value
changes.
Any hints?

Cheers, S.

Not sure if it is related, but some things should be fixed already:

see https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10619

looking into the fix, it uses a spatial selection now...

Hi Andreas,

I've added a public query: 'Recently closed issues' which just queries
all closed issues ordered by date.

Is this enough?

Thanks Richard. Anyone may also feel free to send me directly their changeling entries if they do not have an account on the changelog site. Please use [CHANGELOG] in your email title so I can filter the messages. Including a screenshot and attribution too will be appreciated. Don?t worry if you are not a native english speaker, I am happy to tidy up the language.

Hi,

This can be fixed for Qt 4.8.x, but requires direct access to the Cocoa API
when needed to introduce the non-Qt-source workarounds noted in the
QTBUG-40449 [0].

Btw, this is an example of my old PR [1] to introduce abstracted calls to
the OS (Mac for example, with Objective-C++) to handle changes in OS API
libraries and keep such workarounds in one place instead of peppered
throughout the source tree. Especially for those instances where Qt fails
us, but a direct call to the OS could be abstracted for a workaround where
needed.

Unfortunately, it is a significant change that needs really tested well,
and certainly not reasonable to introduce into 2.10 as a fix, as it is more
of a feature.

I never upgraded to 10.10 for several reasons, but am about to, or I would
have noticed this nasty bug sooner.

Thanks for looking into this Larry,

I'm wondering - is there anything stopping the OSX builds from moving to
the Qt5/pyqt4 combination? I gather qt4 on 10.10 is unsupported and
probably has a lot of little quirks like this we can't easily fix. I'm
tipping the next OSX release will have even more. But since we're not
relying on a distro and are more or less free to choose dependencies on
OSX, couldn't we switch the OSX build across now?

It should be on 2.8.2 then - I cannot see an effect.

I made a PR on QGIS-Documentation yesterday to show the assistant and
explain how to access it. Hope that helps.

The reason it's a bit hidden is that the DD-button is now everywhere in
the Style interface, so the user will get used to the concept, and
data-defined for the Size field seemed quite obvious to me.

The user can also use the 'Graduated by size' to have varying size
symbols, there it's more visible.

The idea behind the generic "assistant" name in the DD-menu is that
DD-button are related to a field in the gui (here Size, so
Size-assistant) and we may want other DD-assitants in the future
(setting-up a color expression, font expression, or a marker shape
expression would benefit from that).

That beeing said, we can add an icon beside the DD-button to launch the
assistant (e.g. magic wand with the appropriate tooltip, or circles with
increasing diameters).

The scale method will gently disappear from the code, the default is now
ScaleDiameter and cannot be changed. The expression for the size is not
composed anymore with a sqrt.

The only thing  that may be misleading is that features with size
expressions that evaluate to NULL will be drawn with the default size
(due to fixing symbols with DD-fields not being drawn in preview and
legend). If it's an unwanted behaviour, then using
coalesce(size_expression, 0) for the size expression will fix that
easily enough.

I've ended up connecting the QSettings() function to the parent QTreeWidget's
itemChanged signal. This works for text and checkboxes, but does not seem to
emit for changing the selected item in a combobox. Does anyone know what
signal is emitted under these circumstances?

I think J?rgen did some changes. They will only kick in, if the spatial
filter is already set before opening the attribute table, not when
defined posterior.
This filter is applied *before* the filter at the bottom is applied, so
if you open the table with a spatial filter, you will not be able to
show something else in the same session.

In the long run I am considering to run the filter defined at the bottom
directly on the provider. You may have seen the recent work on
expression compiler, which should be able to also delegate (some)
attribute filters to the database.

Regards,
Matthias

I'm not sure how complete the Qt5 transition is in QGIS.  I wouldn't want to switch until it's fairly stable, and not in the middle of a long term release (2.8) even if it's only for 2.10+ builds, it's very difficult to have 2 Qt versions installed side by side.

Thanks. In our case, it does not seem to solve the problem.
In any case, I think the current behaviour requires some intervention,
as large tables are not really usable.
Is opening another ticket necessary?
All the best, and thanks again.

I've just trawled through the git log and added rough versions of
everything I think should be included.

I've omitted processing changes as there's so many it's hard to tell what
is noteworthy. Can someone more familiar with this area please add these?

Otherwise it's just a matter of fleshing out these rough entries and adding
screenshots.

Note that there's still an issue with the change log only showing a small
number of pending items at a time....

Message-ID: <CAAcYxUeK9mpee1UH2J6ZFsSX4EsiZWmH09v3QT6OpuvVaanfFw@mail.gmail.com>

I just built QGIS 2.8.2 for RHEL/EPEL 7 (
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/taskinfo?taskID=9997800 ) and it is
available in the testing repo (
https://admin.fedoraproject.org/updates/qgis-2.8.2-1.el7 ). I built it
without PyQwt because it doesn't support Qwt 6 (
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2014-December/036112.html
), so I'm sure that some functionality is disabled and/or won't work but
the main application is available for testing.
Thanks,
Dave

Hi Dave et al,

Thanks, can you maybe also let us know how you would add this repo, so
we can maybe update the instructions?


To me it looks like the instructions here:

http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#rhel-centos-scientific-linux

are not working anymore for recent versions of RHEL/CentSO, but please
correct me if I'm wrong.


I'm not sure if we have an official 'maintainer' of QGIS for the
RedHat/.rpm based distro's currently.

For the sake of the project I think it is good if we have working
instructions for rpm based distro's.

>From Alex I understood that Angelos is maintaining a build server, which
maybe also able to build rpm's?
https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Build_Service_cross_distribution_howto

We should maybe also tell people if is too hard/impossible to install
QGIS or QGIS-server on a RHEL/CentOS version (as I understand on RHEL5.5
it's not doable because of a lack of certain Qt libs)..

Anyway: just bringing some people together hoping we can get better
installs and install instructions for rpm's :-)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

The instructions to enable use of the EPEL repositories can be found here:

I'm currently the owner/packager for EPEL 6/7. That's obviously not a "QGIS
role" but a Fedora one.

I believe that we could build QGIS 1.8 on RHEL 5 without too much problem.
I'm currently only really interested in RHEL 6 and 7, but if there was
interest in supporting QGIS 1.8 on RHEL 5, then I would be glad to do that
as well.

I have QGIS 2.4 building on RHEL 6 with Qt 5. I was planning on updating
the version in EPEL 6 to that, but I need to get some dependent packages
approved first. Also, I would like to use 2.8 since it's a LTR but I'll
need to get QScintillia built and packaged for Qt 5 before I can do that.
So basically, it's possible but will probably still be a little while.

I'm only the maintainer for the RHEL end of things. Volker is main owner
for Fedora and I believe he usually updates rawhide with the latest
release. A new Fedora release happens about every 6 months and the Fedora
update policy ( https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Updates_Policy#Philosophy )
prevents (or at least strongly discourages) doing updates of major/minor
versions in stable releases, so really QGIS can realistically only be
updated every 6 months in Fedora. If more frequent updates are desired (and
there's someone willing to maintain it), then a COPR repository is probably
the best way to go. I've never actually worked with COPR repositories but
my understanding is that they're intended to be easy to work with/maintain
and I believe that most of the time just pulling the latest .spec from
rawhide into the COPR repository would "just work" and would make the
latest version of QGIS available to all stable Fedora releases.

Hi all,

QGIS rpms are maintained here:
https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/Application:Geo
Unfortunately RHEL support was dropped during a cleanup some months ago, 
but if it required, we can re-enable it.

Best,
Angelos

Oh sorry. I totally missed that. Along those lines, I've been meaning to
look into using COPR to provide the newest version of another library that
I maintain for RHEL/CentOS, so when I finally get around to that, I'll look
into making a COPR repository for the latest version of QGIS as well. It
will probably be a while until it's all setup, but I'll post on here when
it's done.

Hi all.
With 159 tickets classified as High and Blocker, it is quite obvious
that even with the investment we are doing, many important bugs will be
left in 2.10.
Obviously the appointed developers will have the best judgement as to
what is most efficient in the limited time frame. I respectfully point
out a couple of serious ones that make working with large (millions of
records) PG tables almost impossible:
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12578
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12926
I think we would do a good service to our enterprise users if we can fix
them. Actually, I'm surprised none of our big users already stepped in:
maybe I'm missing something?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo,

Half of the blocker tickets are in feedback state. Seems like some users 
don't care so much as to response in a reasonable amount of time. Given 
that our "dedicated" bug fixing period is rather short, it is crucial 
that the users who reported a bug also respond quickly.

regarding

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/12926

Are you aware that there are two modes for loading DB tables? There is 
the checkbox "Select at ID". If you uncheck this for large tables it 
means that the initial loading is faster, but once you loaded all 
features they are cached clientside and should allow for fast scrolling. 
Of course this also means more local memory usage.

Note that for slower db-views or slow network connections it is also 
recommended to uncheck the "Select at ID" checkbox, so that the table 
will be cached locally.

Also: Matthias Kuhn is working on the SQL expression compiler that will 
allow serverside filtering. But it won't make it to 2.10. You'd have to 
wait for 2.12.

Regarding issue 12578: the new snapping mechanism was implemented by 
Martin Dobias - so it would be best, if he could fix the issue. 
Hopefully he can do that.

#12926 is a feature request.
 
The workaround for this (see 86d08b6c) - until the sql expression are there -
is to set the initial mode for the attribute table to "only visible on map" in
options.  That will request only the features in the current canvas.

Note that this is different from what you can set in the attribute table
itself.  If set in options the attribute table will always be tied to canvas
extent it was opened with - so "show all" within such a table will again only
show the features in the initial canvas extent - "show only visible" will still
have an effect if you zoom in.

Hi all,  my feeling about this for corporations:

- Testers tends to become experts, skipping some use cases. I have million
rows in some Db's but that never would came to me to send them to any tool
without filtering it on SQL definition. I more commonly have thousands of
records, and QGIS does it. Knowing the limitations with attribute tables, I
don't test it a lot too.. So maybe almost nobody is testing that, when real
user will.. later. 

- I'm sorry again I can't test more QGIS master by now, since I devote my
time to currently new features I funded (proportionnal mapping, next Mask
plugin version), and investigate more on QGIS server by now. 

As a conclusion, I think every GIS administrator gets less and less time
testing when QGIS gets more mature and stable. That also means we have more
real uses. It is a very good sign to me, though we need to find solutions to
raise new testers and spread the working community.  
Cheers
R?gis

About this, 
shouldn't we find a more user friendly wording and tooltip for this? 
I just discover that now...

Hi R?gis,

Yes - I agree that "Select at ID" doesn't really tell the user much. I 
wanted to have something like "Cache locally" - but I vaguely remember 
there was a reason why did not want to rename it. This was 2-3 years 
ago. J?rgen - do you remember why we did not want to name it more 
user-friendly, like "Cache locally"?

Maybe it would be good to revisit this.

There is a tracker for the plugin app, but nobody (myself included) cares
much about it:
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/qgis-django/issues

I'll look to this issue.

Dear all
I have Linux Mint 17.1 and Qgis 2.8.1 Wien version  correctly installed 
using the apt-get operator from the "home/aitor" Terminal:
/
//sudo apt-get update //
//sudo apt-get install qgis python-qgis qgis-plugin-grass/

I am new to Linux/Python , and I not able to find the required paths for 
updating the PYTONPATH and LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order to use pyQGIS from 
an external Python environment.
*
export PYTHONPATH=????**
**export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=????

none of them have worked properly
/
import sys//
//print sys.path/

And this is the result:

Hi All


If anyone is interested, I started a chat room for QGIS at https://gitter.im/qgis <https://gitter.im/qgis> - it is a modern take on IRC and provides a similar experience to HipChat or Slack - you can paste images into the chat, use markdown to format your messages and it has web, desktop and mobile clients (Win / OS X / Linux / Android / IOS). You need a github account to sign in - we look forward to chatting to anyone interested in testing it out!

Ok seems the QGIS github repo for the org is only available to people in our committers list. This one should be completely open:

https://gitter.im/qgis/QGIS <https://gitter.im/qgis/QGIS>

Look forward to seeing you hang out there!

This new chat system forces you to create a github account and
when you have one asks you to allow their application to access all
the data of the organizations you are in.

Does "21st century" mean giving up privacy in exchange for sharing
cat pictures ?

I think organization data is public anyway in terms of which ones you are
part of.

For me I don?t have a problem, and nobody is forced to use it, I was just offering it as a nice alternative. For those who don?t mind the sign up requirements, I hope you enjoy using it.

Hi all,
thanks Andreas and others for your comments and hints.

I agree that Select at ID is certainly ununderstandable for most humans.
IMHO, better rename it now, or open a ticket not to forget about it.
BTW, the option is rather hidden, and not available when (as it happens
more and more often) the layer is loaded through the Browser. Probably
we should make it available there (but this would interfere with the
simple drag & drop) - any idea?

I also agree that if users do not give feedback, a ticket may not be
really important after all. Maybe we could also downgrade them in this case.

Martin, could you please have a look to #12578, as suggested by Andreas?

All the best, and thanks again.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] More complete plugins description
Message-ID: <557BFCC4.6090501@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
recently, QGIS-PSC decided to make it compulsory to have the following
fields for all plugins:
* a more comprehensive description (the `About` field)
* a code repository (can be GitHub or any other, provided it has free
access)
* a bugtracker.
The changes are now in place.
We acknowledge this may be bothering our dear plugin authors, but we
believe this will result in a more clear and reliable infrastructure,
helping our users to choose the right plugin for their job, and
promoting collaboration around the plugins.
We would therefore appreciate if all plugin authors could start updating
their plugins where needed.
Thanks Alessandro for fixing this.
All the best.

Hi Tom,
no min limit, it's up to your evaluation. Common sense rules here :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Rendering layers on QgsMapCanvas render complete
	signal.
Message-ID: <CABWZyyrHFmpj2z3Jy9iJJbA+=yDDK4t8ye3XPwCBGkuZazOFuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I have written a Qt application using the QGis libraries.

I would like to render my 5 layers on top of the "base map" by using the
renderComplete signal from the mapcanvas.

The data in the 5 vector layers is dynamic, and I would like the the "base
map" not to rerender on a refresh, and then render the 5 dynamic layers on
the renderComplete signal, using QGis libraries if possible.

How can I use Qgis renders (sequential or parallel) to do this from my
application?
Any ideas?

Regards

Hi Roy,

this is known issue I haven't been able to fix so far. It has
something to do with getting list of vector layers in thread. It seems
to only happen with GRASS 7 on windows when Vect_cidx_get_* functions
are used in thread (browser items are populated in threads). I have
already double checked the code including relevant parts of GRASS
vector lib without success.

Hi,
what I've understood is that Github should be the main place to report documentation and website issues since Alexandre (if I'm not wrong) has moved and closed all(?) related issues from Redmine and because the "fix me" links at the bottom of web pages lead to Github repo.
So Redmine is used for application issues and Doc Github is preferable for web/doc issues. Maybe, this distinction should also be added to the Documentation?

Hi,
I need to avoid features deletion in some layers both from button and from keyboard. 

How can I perform this in pyqgis?

I have disabled the button with these comand:
    iface.actionDeleteSelected().setDisabled(True)

but the features can be deleted with the backspace or Del.

Hello folks,

for years I have enjoyed reading Lewis Graham's "Random Points" column in
the LiDAR News magazine. I usually get some novel insight or come across a
thought-provoking new concept and this month's column is especially
interesting. It mashes up the ongoing "LAZ clone" conflict that asks to
keep LiDAR stored in "open formats" with the practically related but
conceptually independent "open source" software movement.

The article revives Steve Ballmers ?Linux is a cancer? mantra it talks
about how the GPL license is a "time-bomb" and makes Asia Air Survey - the
gold sponsor of QGIS - appear blue-eyed in their support of such a "viral
license". But it is probably best you read the entire two pages for
yourself.

http://twitter.com/LAStools/status/610057423672471552

As Lewis' opinions are regarded highly by the LiDAR and photogrammetry
industries (myself included) and as the first few paragraphs of this
widely-circulated LiDAR magazine article are a complete distortion of my
personal motivation on "open formats" that will directly hurt my
professional reputation, I have little choice but to respond with a
correction to his column. Let me know if you have any errata on Lewis'
comments about the danger of open source licenses that you want me to
include.

Martin @rapidlasso

You can try to connect to the QgsVectorLayer::featureDeleted signal and
automatically trigger an undo.

If you have a database in the background I would rather opt to set
proper user permissions there

Hi Martin,

just from the first few lines he is confusing "open source" and "free 
software" so
so if he's not intentionally messing up to create confusion, "fear, 
uncertainty and doubt" (FUD strategy)
he has *no clue of what he is talking about*; tell him;

The guy is stuck in 90?s (there is a ?retro? feature in QGIS for him J)!

Maybe you can elaborate more on the vendor lock-in and policies/guidelines against such practices (http://www.pcworld.com/article/2042943/eu-guide-helps-governments-avoid-vendor-lockin.html)

If he is motivated by other things (being ESRI?s Gold partner?.maybe), it is difficult to have a rational discussion with.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QWC wsgi search
Message-ID: <20150615174635.247b47de@linux-597c.site>

Hello List,

I am trying to connect the WSGI-Search to my PostGIS-Database.
Unfortunately I am reatively new to python and I dont really understand
which changes in the search.wsgi/qwc_connect.py I have to make.

I've created a DB-table like the one from the github instructions.
I've changed the DB_CONN_STRING in qwc_connect.py.

Some of my Questions are

1. Is there a way to easily test my DB-Connection in qwc_connect?
   
2. The generated URL with parameters is not how ist supposed to be:
   https://my-page.de/wsgi/search.wsgi?query=&searchtables=&query=wo&cb=stcCallback1001

   - Why are there 2 'query'-params, an empty and a correct one?
   - the searchtables-parameter has no value, whether I put in a
     tablename in the search.wsgi or not ( searchtables =
     ['searchtable']; # enter your default searchtable(s) here ). Where
     does this parameter come from? What am i doing wrong?

If I paste the url in the url bar of chrome it says "error: no search
table". When I put a searchtable-value in the url i get a blank page.
It never says 'error: could not execute query'. So I guess, it doesnt
even get that far.

Thank you
Marc

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgsrasterblock setcolor index out of range error
	message
Message-ID: <CABWZyypiRkF+OC9++7a-caqjwA_-JeOFmmiEq4epv7DxphLP+g@mail.gmail.com>

HI
I have written a Qt application using the QGis libraries.
I have setup a QGis project in Qgis(downloaded version 2.6) itself, and
loads the project from my application.
In the project is a tiff raster image of 1.2Gig that have external pyramids
created with QGis.

While using the QGis project in my application by zooming in and out, I get
the following error in the qgsrasterblock code. Its keep scrolling the
following.
*src\core\raster\qgsrasterblock.cpp: 381: (setColor) index  out of range*

I have captured the output from where it starts with the error and pasted
it on pastebin. http://pastebin.com/MUBd1Uq2

What I have noticed is that on line no.8 the "item" is twice the size of
the "img" is the correct, could this happen?
*8: "src\gui\qgsmapcanvasmap.cpp: 52: (paint) map paint DIFFERENT: sIZE:
img 1553,972  item 3106,1944"*

After this on line no.47 the paint device returned no engine error.
*47: "QPainter::begin: Paint device returned engine == 0, type: 3"*

A bit further on, on line no.66 the "img" is 0,0 in width and height, and
the "item" is the correct size (*1553,972*)
*66: "src\gui\qgsmapcanvasmap.cpp: 52: (paint) map paint DIFFERENT: sIZE:
img 0,0  item 1553,972"*

After that on line no.122 it start to get index out of bounds errors, and
the looks like the application is hanging.

*122: src\core\raster\qgsrasterblock.cpp: 381: (setColor) index 0 out of
range*

Has anyone seen behaviour like this, so that I can have and idea where to
look?

Thank  you, in advance.

Hi Marc,

Here is a wsgi search query from our server:

http://webgis.uster.ch/wsgi/search.wsgi?searchtables=&query=Werriker&cb=stcCallback1005

Note that there are builtin searchtables that are always used (things 
like addresses, parcel numbers, building assurance numbers, geographic 
names, etc.) - you can add additional searchtables e.g. for waste-water 
pipes, etc.

The double query parameter is a mistake and stems from the fact that it 
is by mistake also specified in GlobalOptions.js - look for a line with

Konsole output
varsearchBoxQueryURL = "/wsgi/search.wsgi?";

and remove the extra query parameter. But it is not a big deal, the 
second parameter just replaces the empty one.

Other than that you must check the database permissions and if the login 
parameters are correct.

In the file "search.js" you have to add the default searchtables array, 
if you did not specify one in the URL - something like:

Konsole output
  searchtables = 
['surveydata.searchtable_addresses','gisdata.searchtable_geographicnames'];

So please double check that your searchtables can be accessed with the 
permissions of the web server user, if the login data is correct and if 
the searchtables are specified and contain a valid structure.

Hope this helps,
Andreas

Agreed, better clarify the difference (if I was caught, probably I'll
not be the only one). Maybe remove the "Documentation and help" category

Hi all,
AFAIK, embedding layers and groups in a project should provide a live
link to original project, so if styling of a layer changes in the
source, changes should be reflected in the project that embeds them.
I just checked, and this does not seem to happen on QGIS 2.8.2: am I
missing something, or this is a bug?
Thanks.

Yes - it should behave like your describe.

However, the change only happens if you reload the project that links 
the groups/layer from the other project. Are you expecting it to live 
update if you change the master project?

Hi,

I would like to share latest work on QGIS Web Client featuring some new
stuff and modifications.

Link to a demo page with same qgis project serving once with original QWC
and once with extended version.
http://level2.si/index.php/gis-clients-demo/

Detailed post about what's new -
http://level2.si/index.php/2015/06/14/whats-new-in-extended-qgis-web-client/

Looking forward to your comments, and maybe to discuss features for merging
into original QWC. I did have some wide ideas, but the fact is that major
refactoring is very demanding and I would first like to get some feedback
on this or even better someone joining the work.

Another thing I would like to promote is to show new users demonstration of
various QGIS clients working with same data (I also plan to publish Lizmap)
for testing and comparison. I can provide for hosting such demos. What do
you think?

best regards,
Uros Preloznik

Thanks Andreas for checking. I did not expect live update, but, as you
describe, update when reopening the project with embedded data.
I tried again from scratch, and it is working, so there may have been
some local issue.
Sorry for the noise, tomorrow I'll test on more machines and report back
in case of persisting issues.
All the best.

Hi Marc,

in addition to what Andreas wrote: You should see in Apache's log file 
if something goes wrong with the database connection. Things that may go 
wrong in this respect are:
1) connection to the server is not allowed from the machine the wsgi 
script is located on with the method used (normally username + 
password); file pg_hba_conf
2) the user may connect to the server but not to the database in question
3) the user has no SELECT rights on one of the searchtables

You must have mod_wsgi installed and configured on your Apache server, 
of course.

To easily debug the wsgi-search you may want to enter the search URL 
directly in your browser like
http://my-page.de/wsgi/search.wsgi?query=wo&searchtables=&cb=stcCallback1001 

once you get an answer there you can try it from within QWC

Hello

I've see that processing algs documentation have been refactorized, for 
now there is one .rst file for each group instead of one file for each 
algorithm in the past.
This should have been made to reduce the number of files.

On another side, there is some functions in processing.tools.help that 
create the help files for algorithms, the old way, one file for each 
algorithm, with title level shifted compared to new help files.

Accordingly, updating an algorithm documentation is now much more 
complicated.

Furthermore, there is, in QGIS-Documentation master branch an algorithm 
description which should have been merge with old format (one file in a 
group folder).

Regards

Arnaud Morvan

Hi Arnaud,

Yes, we went 'lost' a couple of 100 files... :-)
Reducing the number of files had 2 purposes:
- it speeded up the build of the documentation, because for every build
we pull the translations from transifex, which is a slow process,
pulling one by one....
- the pdf became awfully heavy... though we have changed the buildscript
now so that theseprocessing algo's are not in the pdf version at all
anyway...

Please let us know when you (or another active french translator) finds
(algorithm) resources in Transifex, which are not available anymore in
the docs.

Mmm, not sure why this is more complicated then before, but you are
right that we have two systems in place to document (actually even more:
we also have the context help).
It is our plan to go to one(!) system, all based on rst/sphinx.
Martin offered to work on that.

I'm not sure what you mean here, can you be more precise? As it is
master and not yet translated, things can still be easily fixed there..

so i'm using qgis-dev (osgeo4w 32 bit) that should receive the changes, 
i wonder
however when i should test the fix after i receive the "closed" status

AFAIK qgis-dev are nightly builds so if i test after a couple of days it 
should be ok,
am i correct?

In the quest for an always closer-to-perfection state of code, some
goblins tried to get the warning count (on gcc and clang) yesterday as
close to zero as possible. This was done in order to allow you (as a
developer) to see if your code changes cause warnings without scrolling
through heaps of meaningless warnings.

**What was done?**

Mostly taking care of deprecated code

QgsMapToPixel
which could mostly be ported to the new methods including rotation. Some
leftovers were being made quiet with macros. Having somebody take care
of these would be appreciated.

QgsFeature::geometryAndOwnership()
is deprecated because since QgsGeometry is implicitly shared, a copy of
the geometry is inexpensive. Hence this easy-to-get-wrong
(double-delete, memory leaks) method has been deprecated. It does not
hurt to leave it in place where it is being used now and in feature
freeze the goblins did not want to risk breaking things there so they
used the macro as well to make them quiet.

Some other warnings coming from documentation and data types have been
fixed as well.

**What's left to do?**

At the moment most of the warnings left originate from the geometry
refactoring and point to empty methods which have not yet been
implemented. These warnings point to real problems and should be fixed
as soon as possible, in order to have some time left before release to
be able to test the fixes before the release. @Marco, what is your
schedule concerning these?

Then there will be only one warning left about a double-translations, I
am pretty sure that we can handle this.

**What's the plan for the future?**

The plan is to let travis test for warnings and if there are warnings
mark the build red. With this in place, an author of a commit will be
required to spend some thoughts on a warning and take care of it before
merging into master. As an example, if you deprecate a method, you will
have to check where it is used, where it can be updated to its successor
and where it's required to use the deprecated method and appropriately
put macros there.
IMO this workflow should be preferred to merging code which produces
warnings of which the community (i.e. "somebody out there") will have to
take care of.

Cheers,
Matthias

I'm happy to fight the warnings, but in this final plan I envision the risk
to break backward compatibility. What I mean is that if someone deprecates
a method, he should still make sure the deprecated method still works.
Having some internal code path using the deprecated method (maybe only in
tests) would serve that purpose. But will raise the warnings.

Incidentally, you hadn't mentioned how your "hushing" macro work, as they
may be an answer to this concern of mine.

In an ideal world, all internal code would be ported to the new API and
some tests guarantee that the legacy API keeps working as expected.
Sometimes it may also be ok to leave internal code use the deprecated
API. It just has to happen consciously.

Hello,

Here an interesting commentary by a software engineer friend of mine who
seems a little more knowledgeable about open source licenses than the
author of the "Open Source Mania" article on LiDAR News:

http://odoepner.wordpress.com/2015/06/16/lidar-news-publishes-uninformed-gpl-rant/

The commentary is titled '?Lidar News? publishes uninformed GPL rant' and
critizises the column in 8 different aspects. Here the beginning of
the commentary and the first aspect:

====================================

In its ?Random Points? column, the June 2015 Lidar News issue contains an
opinion piece called ?Open Source Mania? by Lewis Graham, a director of the
board with ASPRS, the organization that defines the LAS file format.

It contains many inaccuracies and unfair judgements:

1) The author underhandedly attacks Martin Isenburg?s broadly supported
attempts to have theLGPL-licensed de-facto standard LASzip accepted as an
Open Standard and then goes into a rant about the GPL, while lumping both
licenses together as ?viral?. The LGPL ? not the GPL ? explicitly allows
the use as dynamically linked library without any licensing impact on the
main program. Combining the attack on the LASzip community with a rant
against GPL while ignoring the main difference between LGPL and GPL is
unfair to say the least.

2) ...

====================================

Regards,

Martin @rapidlasso

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYppdyTbMR3dAY+imHNoXQwOz7ZR3u8BuaX7pvNvcnY-xA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I need to debug QGIS GRASS provider on Windows. I have successfully
compiled GRASS 7 using MinGW [1] and QGIS using MSVC [2]. The problem
is that MSVC does not support GCC debugging symbols and vice versa. Do
you have any idea how to debug both QGIS and GRASS code at the same
time, preferably in MSVC or Qt Creator?

Is there any recent effort to compile GRASS with MSVC? I have only
found quite an old mail about MSVC port [3].

Hi folks,

What is the python console syntax for the equivalent of pushing the
"iterate over layers" processing button when using runalg() ? e.g.
"p.runalg(... iterative=yes)".

>From "Additional functions for handling data" section in the training
manual it likely has something to do with "getfeatures(layer)" but I'm not
sure how to use these together.

More at
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/150703/interactive-for-each-item-in-do-in-qgis/151042#151042

I tried to figure this out myself using the "Processing >> History and log"
dialog, but that doesn't show any results when the Iterate button is
depressed. In the following screen shot, the bottom two "INFO" entries are
for an iterative processing operation, but they don't have corresponding
"ALGORITHM" entries. While the topmost "INFO" corresponds to the one and
only "ALGORITHM" entry, which wasn't iterative.


?

I'm using 32bit QGIS 2.8 on Windows (via Osgeo4w).

best regards,

Matt

There is an exploratory effort to use CMake for GRASS GIS [1] but there is
a lack of CMake experts with free time. In theory this is one of the steps
to compile GRASS with MSVC. Isn't it possible to easily compile QGIS with
MinGW thanks to CMake (since GCC is used on other platforms)?

There is no command to run and algorithm iteratively from the command line.
You can iterate creating yourself a loop and separating the features of the
input layer in the loop.

This method from the AlgorithmExecutor class might help you:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/gui/AlgorithmExecutor.py#L58

Hope this helps

Cheers

Thanks for the info.

Reading the linked article, it looks like there will be native support
for this from Qt 5.

Hello everyone,
This is Karolina - I met a lot of you in Nodebo last month. I wrote an
article on how to use QGIS and the TimeManager plugin to visualize a
geospatial dataset. Those of you who attended the TimeManager workshop
Anita Graser & me gave will find the UFO dataset familiar.

Here it is:
https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/using-python-and-qgis-for-geospatial-visualization

If this article gets more than 300 shares until Friday I will get a bonus
from the website because it's a writing competition. I think it's also nice
for QGIS to get some more publicity (airpair is quite a high traffic site),
so it would be great if you share on social media (need to use a special
link for it to count, so please click on the social media buttons on the
article page to share).

Bests,
Karolina

qgis2web saves its settings via QSettings(). However, it currently simply
saves a load of ungrouped individual settings, which doesn't seem sensible
(and potentially could overwrite non-qgis2web settings). Is there a
preferred QSettings() group convention for plugins, or should I just use
"qgis2web/setting_name"?

Hi !

Is it possible to change the query of a postgis query layer in python
without reloading the project ?

The goal is to have a parameter in my query that I'd be able to change with
a slider.

I tried the QgsVectorLayer.setDataSource() method, but it makes QGis crash.
I tried the workaround described here (
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/62610/changing-data-source-of-layer-in-qgis
), writing and reading the XML file, but it also makes QGis crash.

If not possible, is there a serious limitation behind this, or is the
feature just missing/bugged ?

Example :

I have this query loaded as a layer:

"SELECT id, name, ST_Buffer(geom,25) as geom FROM my_table"

But I want to be able to change the hardcoded buffer from 25 to some value
from a QSlider.

Thanks!

Olivier

Great article Karolina - it was great to see you at the hackfest - keep more articles like that coming (and if you can make an rss filter on QGIS specific articles you write, let me know and I will add you to http://planet.qgis.org <http://planet.qgis.org/>

Hi Tom,

for what I know your proposal is fine. In this way you form a 'group'
qgis2web in which you are free to form even more hierarchy:
see http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/qsettings.html

If you start qgis from command line like this:

qgis --configpath /tmp/qgis

(actually start it twice, first time you have errors because of missing
stuff)....
You will find a QGIS/QGIS2.ini file with all QSettings key/values (in
this fresh configuration). Add some plugins and work with them to see
their settings.

It is on my wishlist to have a table with all current settings in the
Options/System dialog just like you have one for 'Current environment
variables' there...

On linux your QSettings are in ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.ini on Windows it is
hidden in the registry OR you use the --configpath trick above to force
writing out to an inifile.

Hope this helps,

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Good stuff!

I wanted to share it but did not find the share button. Can you point me

Actually it seems the layer.setDataSource() method works, sorry for the
noise !

But then it resets the style of the layer to default (uniform random
color), as if the layer was freshly added...

I tried this :

# get values
oldRenderer = layer.rendererV2().clone()
oldDataSource = layer.dataProvider().dataSourceUri()
newDataSource =
re.sub('\/\*\*\/[0-9.]*\/\*\*\/','/**/'+str(buffer)+'/**/',oldDataSource)

# set values
layer.setDataSource( newDataSource, layer.name(),
layer.dataProvider().name() )
layer.setRendererV2( oldRenderer  )

But it crashes because of the last line, when setting the rendererV2.

This workaround works :

# get values
oldRendererXML = layer.rendererV2().save( QDomDocument() )
oldDataSource = layer.dataProvider().dataSourceUri()
newDataSource =
re.sub('\/\*\*\/[0-9.]*\/\*\*\/','/**/'+str(date)+'/**/',oldDataSource)

# set values
layer.setDataSource( newDataSource, layer.name(),
layer.dataProvider().name() )
layer.setRendererV2( QgsFeatureRendererV2.load(oldRendererXML) )


The whole thing is slow though when compared to layer.setSubsetString(...),
not allowing for nice realtime feedback for the user.
>From looking into the source, it seems the QgsVectorLayer::setDataSource
method considers the layer is freshly added: it resets the CRS, it
creates/loads a rendererV2, it sets the legend, and it connects some
signals, all of which probably explains why it's so slow.

Would it be possible to change that method to to update the dataSource of
an existing layer ? Or to add a changeDataSource(...) method ?

Thanks !

Olivier

Hi Olivier,
In your case, I think that the best way to do this is to create a view from
the sql query and load it as layer, than, when qslider changes, change the
view definition with "ALTER VIEW"  and reload the layer.

Enrico Ferreguti

Hmm I didn't think of that, thanks for the idea ! But I can't use it since
I may have several user at once.

Hi all,
I just approved yet another geocoding plugin:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GeoCodingKorea/
I feel uneasy about this proliferation: do you think we could help
developers merging their efforts? Maybe we can add one of the existing
ones to core, making it pluggable, so we can invite developers to add
their national system as a plugin, instead of reinventing the wheel?
All the best.

Hi Olivier,
datasource changing is a feature that I really miss and wait from longtime.
Every Qgis new release I checked without success if the properties
datasource string is editable. I recently found the hack you report (
https://geogear.wordpress.som/2015/05/15/changing-qgis-layer-datasource-with-python/)
that I verify to be working up to Wien 2.8.2. Till 2.9 the code crash qgis.
Reading your post I realized that a new QgsVectorLayer method has appeared:
setDatasource. Wow! Perhaps the waiting is going to be over....

Enrico Ferreguti.

Hey all,

Has anyone done or know any good tools for doing network analysis in QGIS.
Stuff like finding downstream nodes on pipes, turning off switches to see
downstream effects?

I know there is a network x library for Python which might be able to do it
however I can't seem to find it.  I thought it was uploaded to the plugin
repository

Nathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Telemetry Layer (new release made)
Message-ID: <E9795EA7-C04F-4A29-9590-33B1B45D67E7@southweb.co.nz>

Have just uploaded a new version of our experimental Telemetry Layer (MQTT <-> QGIS integration) plugin.

Am reasonably happy with this release.  There are things missing, and no doubt some defects, but what is there seems quite stable and provides a nice framework for extension.

An example sample plugin that uses the Telemetry Layer classes is provided showing how to sub class a topic manager and feature dock to provide customised styling and behaviour on a per layer/per feature basis.

Each feature is a topic and additional variables (i.e. like tank height settings for a water tank) can be set via V2Widgets ( hmm. side note -  is there a plan to upgrade the default feature dialog to support better names and tool tips for each widget?)

Payloads by default are formatted by custom $qgsfuncs but options to access/modify/render the underlying payload data before being committed to its feature or via the floating dock interface is possible.

Feature dock parent classes exist for basic text; a simple toggle switch showing the use of an 'mqtt publish', and an SVG widget using QSvgWidget  (that does currently does nothing but looks really cool).

Possible use cases for the future:

- Move features using GPS coords as payloads
- Show images from fixed web cams or update a raster layer
- Standard HMI functions to control/view sensors and actuators
- UAV integration


If you can see the potential and are excited by this, a helping hand or some crowd funding is always welcome. High on my list are:

- creating the logic for a range of SVG controls (dials, switches, sliders, meters etc.)
- performing the transforms from GPS coords to dx/dy and adding the logic for moving features based on this
- migrating the Rule Based layer formatter from static .qml file to programmatic creation
- more cross platform testing

Github here:

https://github.com/nzfarmer1/telemetrylayer

Thanks for your time.

Andrew

Hi Nathan,

Networkx is a python module. On Windows it is part of the standard 
distribution of QGIS (both in standalone and OSGeo4W). To use it, you 
can have a look at the QGEP plugin that Matthias Kuhn did: 
https://github.com/QGEP/QGEP/tree/master/qgepplugin

He is also the one to ask for details how it works if you don't figure 
it out from the example.

Best greetings,
Andreas

My recommendation would be igraph (http://igraph.org/).
Powerful, Open Source (https://github.com/igraph), well documented, and comes with Python, and C++ and R interfaces.
I used it in the r.connectivity.network addon for GRASS 6 and was quite happy with it!

Hi,

GeoCoding functionality is also available directly in GDAL core, we could
also use that API and leave particular (local) cases for plugins, see my
experiments here to get and idea about what can be done with GDAL GeoCoding
API:

http://www.itopen.it/geocoding-with-gdal/lang-pref/en/

The main concern I see with core inclusion is that most of the times you
are using proprietary geocoding services (like Google's one) you break
their TOS. Expecially when doing batch geocoding, you also have to take
care of number of calls/sec. and you *must* implement local caching (as
GDAL does).

Hi devs!

I need to Export atlas composition to a single PDF file.
I have the same problem as the one exposed in this thread:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2014-August/028744.html

Is that functionality already resolved through Python code?

Apart from the issue queue I think it would also make sense to have a
look at the pull request queue.
I am sure there are some ready-to-use or minimal-effort improvements there.

I have tagged some which I think should be merged before the release
with "milestone 2.10" (and others which I consider new features with
"milestone 2.12")
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/milestones/2.10

Feel free to tag or retag pull requests.
And of course comment, improve and finally merge good stuff.

Best

Hi,
Following that discussion, I'm planning to release in a couple of weeks a
new version of **Maps Printer** plugin that will export also atlases. I'm
not sure the code I have in github is enough stable yet. Will give it a
look soon.
Meanwhile, You can see the code of **Surveying Calculation** plugin
(bacth_plotting_dialog.py). It exposed a kind of python code of the needed
function.

Perfect - I've implemented it as described. Thanks for the help, Richard.

Hi List

The problem in the end was that I hit the 2Gig virtual memory address space
for a 32bit application. The application was build with debug libraries of
Qt and QGis, when fully loaded, the virtual memory was on 1.8Gig, and when
using the application, some of the GIS layers came on when zooming in, it
just crashed in the tiff layer. A weeks earlier, i saw that some of the
layers when zooming in just did not load, and that jobs was just removed
from the joblist when rendering. Jobs was removed due to the fact that a
QImage could not be allocated, for the layer, thus removed from the
joblist.
It was very misleading because according to the task manager, there was
still loads of memory for the task to create these QImages.

The solution for this was to make the application LARGEADDRESSAWARE , to do
this I have to build the application with the *-Wl,--large-address-aware*
linker option. (this is for MinGW, dont know what you have to use for MSVC
builds)
I also have to run "bcdedit /set IncreaseUserVA 3072" (without the quotes)
in a cmd prompt with administrator privileges, to get access to 3Gig of
virtual address space for my process, and allows me to run
the application in debug mode, without any crashes.

Here is link to the memory limits of windows
https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366778(v=vs.85).aspx


When building  my application and libraries and QGis with release versions
of the libraries, it performs well and there is no crashes.
The virtual memory for the process then comes in at 700 - 800mb

Regards
Theuns Heydenrych

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Moving map content: interference by overlying
	objects
Message-ID: <5582ECBF.7020303@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
in Print composer, if an object (e.g. an ellipse) overlays partly or
totally a map, it will not allow to move the content of the selected map
below it. I can understand the rationale, but I believe that once
selected the map should be movable. This is especially unexpected in
case of an unfilled ellipse|rectangle|triangle.
More generally, I got accustomed to using the move content, but I still
think it's a bit cumbersome, and a better system could possibly be
devised. How similar software behave?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo,

You can lock the elements that are on top of the map so they don't 
"steel" the events. When I work in print composer, 90% of my elements 
are locked and only occasionally unlocked if I really want to move 
things around. You have to work more with the item tree (like in any 
drawing app). Note that you can still select locked items in the item 
tree and can change properties of locked items. Only interactive 
selection in the canvas and moving elements is locked if they are in 
lock state.

Hi all,
I remember some discussion and work about making expressions case
insensitive. I do not know the situation about the filed names in
expression: IMHO the filtering on them should always be case
insensitive, as most users would expect. Is this implemented, or planned
to, or there are good reasons to avoid it?
Thanks for comments.

Thanks for the clarification, Andreas. I agree that for skilled users,
used to high end graphical programs, this can be the best behaviour. I
just noticed, during several courses, that normal GIS users tend to get
confused about this.
All the best.

I'd also recommend igraph.
Description below describes how I'm using igraph (cut and paste from an earlier private email conversation).

I still use grass for some aspects of topology cleaning (eg messy OSM data), but igraph thereafter.

This is how I'm using igraph currently...

CMake would be nice.

In theory yes, but it means moving away from final build (QGIS built
with MSVC in OSGeo4W). There are also other important libs (Qt for
example) built with MSVC.

I have somehow managed to compile limited GRASS core libs with MSVC
and GRASS Makefiles replacing gcc by cl.exe. The build system does not
seem to be the biggest problem, there are still pieces of code not
compiling under MSVC however.

try to figure it out on my own first of course.

Have a nice weekend,

I would like to, it was originally my aim to also submit patches, but
being stressed by time (QGIS release July 26), I am just putting hack
over hack to get it running and debuggable to be able to fix bugs for
the release.

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYpAVPFqEbWbnQe8=Vis+m32ps75H79S0EAuay=MK7mAMA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am trying to fix QGIS (compiled by MSVC) crashes with GRASS 7
(compiled by MinGW) on Windows. I have traced down that it crashes
when functions are called on a FILE structure which was created by a
library (libgrass_gis.7.0.0.dll in this case) compiled by MinGW in a
thread in an application compiled by MSVC. It crashes in Microsoft
_lock_file(FILE *pf) where pf is casted to _FILEX:

    EnterCriticalSection( &(((_FILEX *)pf)->lock) );

where _FILEX is defined as

    typedef struct {
        FILE f;
        CRITICAL_SECTION lock;
    }   _FILEX;

Most probably, when the file is opened in a library compiled by MinGW,
it is not allocated as _FILEX but as FILE and accessing the lock is
causing the crash. Does anybody have deeper insight into the problem
and how to solve it?

It does not happen with GRASS 6 compiled with MinGW. Are you aware of
any difference between GRASS 6 and 7 build in OSGeo4W? E.g. different
GCC version or compilation options?

It works if the library is compiled by MSVC.

Well, it's another side of the same general issue, setting always the
default to case insensitive for all searches, but of course it's a
different menu.
Thanks.

I cannot comment on this particular case, but in the Windows world, I believe 
the internal layout of FILE structure is specific to the C runtime used, so you 
cannot exchange them between different compilers. If you want to mix them, the 
library must return an opaque pointer to the using code and provide all needed 
functions to manipulate and free it.

/* Opaque type */
typedef struct mySuperFile mySuperFile;

mySuperFile* MyLibReturnFile(...);
int MyLibReadFile(mySuperFile*, ...); /* use same protype as fread() */
void MyLibCloseFile(mySuperFile*);

Thanks for your comment. It means that I am probably on a wrong track.
The GRASS lib in fact does all the operations on the file. Because it
is impossible to debug a lib compiled with MinGW when QGIS is compiled
by MSVC and it works OK with GRASS libs compiled with MSVC I have
mixed vector lib compiled by MSVC (which I con debug) with gis lib
compiled by MinGW, which I thought is causing the problem.

I have also created new issue https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13002
and added your comment.

Using the rule-based symbology with several rules and an ELSE expression.
If you, in map canvas legend, set a rule "layer" to invisible, all it's
features will be represented with the ELSE Symbol.

Not sure if this is the expected behaviour. I would expect that those
feature would simply became invisible.

Should I open a ticket?

I would say they are getting skipped in the rule check so fall into the
else rule.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Join by location does not work when layer have
	equivalent filed names
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_EZ-8m0hvBDsd_mT3t6Rjcz8HfT0ewdKzQprooqgXjOrA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Can someone confirm that the join by location functionality does not fill
the fields with values from the joined layer. This happens if the Target
vector layer has equal or similar (with caps) field names.

The new fileds are renamed to fieldname_1 but the values are no set.

Can/should I open a ticket?

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Indeed Nathan,

But do you thinks that is what you were expecting? when you turn the
"layer" off?

I've this kind of bug too.

If you create a categorized symbology, apply the change and then switch to
a ruled-based symbology (keeping the previous rules), you will see that the
ELSE statement will draw features twice.

Enable "show feature count" to check.

I didn't check if there is a ticket for that.

In my opinion this is a bug. I agree that by switching off the rule 
should not make the features fall into the ELSE rule. At least from a 
usability point of view. Or we need to ELSE rules - a "TRUE ELSE" rule 
that behaves like now and an "ELSE" rule that behaves like the users 
expect it to behave.

Hi all,
I'm noticing that if you open a project, than onther one, the first
projection seems to be preserved, and reprojection activated. Of course
this may result in weird behaviours.
Anyone has seen the same?
Thanks.

Just my 2 cents on a topic I know nothing about :)

... or we can have a "disable rule" and an "invisible rule". Disabled
rules go to ELSE, invisible rules don't go to ELSE.

Probably I pinned the problem down: all the machines not working had a
previous instalation of QGIS, the fresh ones are working smoothly.
So it must ba a leftover, probably the path: should one look in Windows
registry?
In this case better reset on postinstall?
All the best.

confirmed here, also on master version, it looks like a QGIS-Server issue.
Using a postgres or spatialite connection works fine.

Have you filed a ticket for it?

Hi all,
I'm unsure it has been mentioned before. Upon upgrading I'm getting the
error below (on severeal machines and OSs). Restarting QGIS fixes it.
Thanks!

Finally I found it, it is similar story like with FILE.

The provider (MSVC) calls Vect__open_old with struct Map_info variable
allocated in the provider where sizeof(struct Map_info) = 1408.
Vect__open_old (MinGW) calls G_zero on that variable, where
sizeof(struct Map_info) = 1520.

It means that all structures used in GRASS libs must be also allocated
in GRASS. New functions like Vect_alloc_map have to be added to GRASS
and until it gets to GRASS and to OSGeo4w, the the structures must be
be allocated in the provider with enough space.

Strange thing that it came up only now with GRASS 7 and threads.

Thanks for your ideas Even and Jef
Radim

Hi Radim,

Did you check that the internal offsets of the members inside the struct
are the same? Or are you accessing the members always only in one of the
two libs?

To be honest, this sounds a bit scary...

Cheers

No I did not and I would not expect that.

The data are read via GRASS lib functions to which pointer to map
structure is passed as argument. Only some simple structures (composed
of int,double) are accessed directly.

I know that even size of int is not guaranteed but that is probably
the only suspicious type and that is surely the same for MSVC and
MinGW, double is IEEE 754.

I do not know why it is still searching for the old QGIS version.
Maybe something in Windows registry?
I leave this to some Win guru.
All the best.

Did some testing, and partly confirmed here, but hard to reproduce.

Sometimes the project crs is taken over (switching between a 28992 and
4326 project) and sometimes it stays 28992 then, and sometimes it
follows the right crs...

Would be good to have a more reproducable scenario, but starting with a
fresh  config (--configpath /tmp/foo) create a 4326 project, then crate
a 28992 project, then go to 4326 again (via recent projects) the crs
will stay 28992 there (as if there is no 4326 defined in the project??)..
After this switching between those two projects will be ok.

BUT closing QGIS and then first open (via recent) 28992 and then 4326
the latter one will stay in 28992

Maybe has something to do with the fact that we switch between
geographic and projected crs's?

I also tested it without data (so 'emtpy' project but selecting 4326 for
one and 28992 for the second), but then it seems to go ok...

created an issue for it: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13011

Thanks Richard for confirming. I added a note to the ticket.
I can do more testing in about 10 days from now, but I'm afraid it will
be too late for 2.10.
IMHO it's a nasty bug, because if the following project is on a zone
which is invalid for the previous CRS (outside its bounding box), the
layers will be visualized wildly, or possibly not shown at all.
For a newbie, this can be really scary, and he may not have a clue on
how to solve it.
The solution might be simply to clear up the current projection before
loading a new one, right?
All the best.

Exactly - these are good terms to use - "disabled rule" and "invisible 
rule". Thanks for suggesting these, Andreas. Alexandre - could you 
please note this in the ticket?

@David Glad to know this!

@siki, @Nyall a novice question : what does it need to expose this function
in the console (or python side) following the work already done in
"Surveying Calculation" plugin?

Surely if a layer is unchecked in the legend, none of its features should

Hi all,

Here is my fourth report [1] on the multithreading support. 
Feel free to comment the report or any other post.

The code is on the dev branch [2].

Have a nice week,

Hi Marcus,

Good to see that you are making progress, it's nice to see the
"completed this week" list being so long :)

I think it would be good to include this blog on planet.qgis.org, I
guess there is an RSS feed that can be added to the aggregator?

Anyway, keep up the good work!

All the best,
Matthias

Mmm, done:

http://qgis.org

http://planet.qgis.org

but as Marcus is such an active blogger, he is on all frontpages now :-)

Is this ok?

@Marcus: if it is possible, maybe do a weekly report to, and
tag/categorize this one, so instead of this feed, I only do the weekly ones?

Anyway, it is great to see that is progress and action!!

Is it possibly to build a Python plugin minded for the print composer alone? 

-Need to build a plugin with a new button inside print composer that lists
all labels in the composer in a new dialog for editing. This would be a tool
for easy handling of complex header and footers in the layout for the novice
user.

Hi Roy,

the bug is fixed in OSGeo4w qgis-dev-2.9.0-104. Apart from browsing
and displaying GRASS data you should be able to import data to GRASS
in the browser with drag and drop. There are still some issues with
import which I am trying to sort out:
- vector import with more features is slow due to slow inserting to db
(provider problem, v.in.ogr is fast)
- temporary vector maps (polygons cleaning) are not deleted
- animated import icon is missing, it means no layer icon = import
running, for now on Windows

Testing is welcome.

I forgot to add that GRASS stable in OSGeo4W switched to
grass-7.0.1RC1-1 while qgis-dev-2.9.0-104 is still compiled with
grass-7.0.0-1 so when updating OSGeo4W select manually to keep
grass-7.0.0-1.

Hi Jacob.
For the moment it isn't possible to extend the Composer with custom
plugins. It's sonething that will be discussed for the next Report Engine
(QGIS > 3.0)
I've built a Python plugin that uses the composer widgets (composition,
items, etc.) within a custom interface but you can only use the building
blocks by yourself. E.g. you can open/create abd manage a composition
inside your own widget and add items to it. In your case they could be text
or html items, for header and footer.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Using environment variables in path definitions in
	QGIS
Message-ID: <5587D5FA.6050900@gmail.com>

To the QGIS developers list -

I have a goal of making a fully portable Windows edition of QGIS. "Fully 
portable" means that I simply can install QGIS by copying the QGIS 
program directory to a location on the users PC and  start QGIS by 
double clicking on the QGIS.bat file in the "..\bin" directory.

I've reached 95% of my target by using the OSGeo4W installation as a 
template and making some modification the the start-up bat file. Mostly 
by using the --configpath qualifier to 1) redefine the location of the 
QGIS user directory .qgis2 and 2) not using the registry to save option 
values.

By using the --configpath qualifier QGIS creates and uses the 
.qgis2\QGIS\QGIS2.ini file to store option values normally located in 
the registry. Some of these values are path definitions:

example:

Configuration\SAGA_FOLDER=C:/OSGeo4W/apps\\saga
Configuration\GRASS_WIN_SHELL=C:/OSGeo4W/apps\\msys
Configuration\R_SCRIPTS_FOLDER=C:\\OSGeo4W\\.qgis2\\processing\\rscripts

I would like to use environment variables as part of the path definition 
in the ini file like this:

Configuration\SAGA_FOLDER=%OSGEO4W_HOME%/apps\\saga
Configuration\GRASS_WIN_SHELL=%OSGEO4W_HOME%/apps\\msys
Configuration\R_SCRIPTS_FOLDER=%QGIS_USERDIR%\\processing\\rscripts

(OSGEO4W_HOME and QGIS_USERDIR is environment variables, that contains 
the path for the QGIS program directory and the QGIS user directory)

The problem is, that QGIS doesn't interpret the %......% as a 
environment variable and replace it with the value of the variable but 
simply interprets it literally resulting in paths containing "%" - signs 
and environment variable names.

Is there a method to get QGIS to interpret the environment variable and 
replace it with the content of the variable ? Or should a put it on the 
wish list in the bug tracker ?

Looks like you do not have GDAL correctly installed in there. Both

Maybe it is a bit tricky for a general solution, since variables are defined and named differently on the different OSes?...

As a workaround you could probably put a string replacement procedure into your QGIS.bat?
We used e.g. a "#USERPROFILE#" string, as a placeholder, which got replaced when a custom QGIS2 folder template - containing the QGIS.ini - was copied to a new user...

Not too trivial to replace a string in a text-file on Windows using batch (I understood from my colleagues)...

Cheers
Stefan

I've reached 95% of my target by using the OSGeo4W installation as a template and making some modification the the start-up bat file. Mostly by using the --configpath qualifier to 1) redefine the location of the QGIS user directory .qgis2 and 2) not using the registry to save option values.

By using the --configpath qualifier QGIS creates and uses the .qgis2\QGIS\QGIS2.ini file to store option values normally located in the registry. Some of these values are path definitions:

example:

Configuration\SAGA_FOLDER=C:/OSGeo4W/apps\\saga
Configuration\GRASS_WIN_SHELL=C:/OSGeo4W/apps\\msys
Configuration\R_SCRIPTS_FOLDER=C:\\OSGeo4W\\.qgis2\\processing\\rscripts

I would like to use environment variables as part of the path definition in the ini file like this:

Configuration\SAGA_FOLDER=%OSGEO4W_HOME%/apps\\saga
Configuration\GRASS_WIN_SHELL=%OSGEO4W_HOME%/apps\\msys
Configuration\R_SCRIPTS_FOLDER=%QGIS_USERDIR%\\processing\\rscripts

(OSGEO4W_HOME and QGIS_USERDIR is environment variables, that contains the path for the QGIS program directory and the QGIS user directory)

The problem is, that QGIS doesn't interpret the %......% as a environment variable and replace it with the value of the variable but simply interprets it literally resulting in paths containing "%" - signs and environment variable names.

Is there a method to get QGIS to interpret the environment variable and replace it with the content of the variable ? Or should a put it on the wish list in the bug tracker ?

No, you're right. It was crashy. It's been fixed in master, and I've
also made it now retain the layer's renderer and legend if the
geometry type has not changed.

Hope that helps!

Hi Giovanni, thanks for the update. Another solution would be to catch the
event when a user starts an existing print composer. Cannot in doc for the
pyqgis API find anything for this. Anyone who know is one can listens for a
print composer to startup by the user and act on it.

I'm just forwarding the issue report I just see in QGIS hub (

You can act on it but you can't custom gui widgets to the Composer
interface.
I cannot check the code right know. I listen to a specific (existing)
composition opening but if I remember correctly you can watch the Composer
opening too.

I?ve created a category called ?reports? for weekly reports. We can now change the RSS feed.
How can I change?

The other posts will be on the ?Midterm? category.

Best regards,
Marcus

I've just pushed some fixes to master which reimplement these stubbed
methods and comment out some of the unimplemented new methods. 2.10
release was approaching too close for comfort to leave these in!
@Marco Please let me know if I've made any errors doing this...

Hi Jakob,

A workaround would be to have a plugin that creates a new composer view
object:

*custom_composer = self.iface.createNewComposer("My Composer")*

Then get a reference to the main window in the composer view:

*main_window = custom_composer.composerWindow()*

Then you can either add a new toolbar (and required actions) or append an
action to the main toolbar. Have a look at the ComposerWrapper class for
something similar we implemented for designing charts in the composer:
https://gist.github.com/gkahiu/06a43a589f9441736397

Hope this is helpful.

Cheers,

John

Hi Stefan -

Thanks for the answer.

My "Plan B" was to manually create a "QGIS2.ref", which is identical 
with the original "qgis2.ini", but with every occurrence of  the program 
path and the user profile path replaced with references to environment 
variable names. And then use the sed editor to exchange the variable 
names in qgis2.ref with the actual paths on-the-fly under start-up. More 
or less the solution you suggested.

Sed is luckily included in the OSGeo4W package by default, so I'll have 
a go on "plan B" :-)

And I will add a request about environment variable substitution to the 
existing issue 12623.

... this is now merged and we now have an excellent signal/noise ratio

Hi Victor,

Thanks for the answer. I maybe the first one, but I need to launch a model
in the InaSAFE plugin and I don't want to write by hand the equivalent in
python :)
I tried your code above :

model = ModelerAlgorithm.fromFile("Path/to/your/model/file")
model.provider = Processing.modeler
Processing.modeler.algs.append(model)

But I can't launch it with runalg, I got 'Algorithm not found', so I add
this :
Processing.algs['model'][model.commandLineName()] = model

I can see it with processing.alglist now.

But I can't launch it with processing.runalg :

    self._algInstance =

Do you have an idea ?

The suggestion from John is exactly what we did too. And we also built a
chart composer...

It would be great to have the means to know what other teams are working
to. It would save a lor of time and money and, probably, get better
software from a shared effort ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error Offline Editing
Message-ID: <CANd412S584FLVyPEf6v_xHjUzUhrt7MNrf3GTcmo=HJFdf8euA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have been using the offline editing plugin and i have detected a problem.

Using PostGIS like data source, the plugin creates sqlite database.

But the problem is, that the relationship between feature on postgis and
sqlite its alterate.

In the table logs_fid the field values 'remote_fid' don't correspond with
the correct  value for 'offline_fid'

Finally Synchronize works fine, but data is send to the wrong feature.

Regards

Valenty

I've got a bit further with this, but have an embarrassingly basic question.
I'm using Tim's Plugin Builder's run-env-linux.sh, but the default QGIS path
doesn't seem to match where Travis installs QGIS to - is Travis running
Ubuntu? Can anyone tell me what QGIS path I should pass to run-env-linux.sh?

I have. I was just trying to put together as minimal a test environment as possible. I didn't know which packages from the inasafe yaml I needed, and which I could do without. I presume it requires many more than qgis2web.

Message-ID: <CAEMrtYpWAf1GmXAsB21zsLM4CB_Pp4XVpDSNOe=vsfdygyfPMA@mail.gmail.com>

Vector import to GRASS in QGIS browser is very slow when using SQLite
database, about 6s/1000 features. It takes less than 1s with dbf
driver or if v.in.ogr + sqlite is used (even if run from GRASS tools).

The chain is: qgis.exe -> thread -> qgis.v.in.exe -> sqlite.exe

Could it be some SQLite db locking? Somehow switched on when
sqlite.exe driver is started from multi thread app? qgis.v.in.exe is
C++ MSVC. Any idea?

Hi Valenty,

This sounds like a bug. It would be great if you could open an issue
report at
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#bugs-features-and-issue
with as much details as possible and the steps to reproduce the problem.

Cheers,
Matthias

By default in QGIS plugin builder you meant is here
https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/blob/master/run-env-linux.sh#L6
?. If so, that is not the default if you install QGIS like this in Travis
https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/blob/develop/.travis.yml#L17. You can just
pass /usr as the argument when running run-env-linux.sh script

Message-ID: <CAB28AshTrtEy1bZCW+3A+50i8ZaXhffz0_dj8-5P6suC8AM-GA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Unfortunately, we've become aware of a serious performance regression
caused by the new geometry engine. Basically, the situation is that for all
geometry operations which rely on geos (think buffers, splits, spatial
relation operations such as intersects and within,... ) the geometry now
needs to be converted into a geos representation with *every* operation. In
the old geometry engine this conversion was done once, and the result
stored so that follow up operations would not need to recalculate it. This
potentially has huge impacts on the performance of common tasks such as
selecting all features which intersect a geometry.

I've had a look, and unfortunately it's not trivial to fix this. I think
the correct solution to this is to:

- make QgsGeometryEngine accept and return QgsGeometry containers, not
QgsAbstractGeometryV2
- store the generated geos representation of geometries within
QgsGeometryPrivate inside the QgsGeometry container. This way it will be
reusable between different geometry operations, and shared when QgsGeometry
objects are copied. This will also have the benefit that if a geometry is
prepared using geos then subsequent geos operations performed on that
QgsGeometry and its shared copies will be much faster.
- make QgsGeometry a friend class of QgsGeo, so that it can access
QgsGeometryPrivate to retrieve or set the geos representation of the
geometry as required

An alternative (short term) solution would be to just cache the geos
representation when geometry operations are called through the older
QgsGeometry modification/relationship operations. This would be easier, but
means that the API of QgsGeometryEngine will be stuck with the current
design, and we won't be able to properly fix this until breaking the api
for 3.0.

Either way, I doubt this can be addressed within the remaining 3 days we
have until release. Should we delay to address this? Release with the
regression? Or am I missing something and there's an easier solution we
could implement? Or even possibly this additional cost of recalculating the
geos representation is trivial and can be ignored (maybe someone could test
this with a little repeated intersection script)?

Thoughts?

Hi

Agreed with Nyall. Apart from the above mentioned problems, there are
newly introduced performance regressions with snapping: the cached
geometries in 2.10 take double the amount of memory they used in 2.8,
and snapping got much slower with more complex layers (compared to
2.8) - e.g. with [1]. The extra memory consumption is caused by the
fact that providers provide geometry in WKB representation, which is
then converted to new representation and WKB is kept. We should use
just one representation and drop the usage of the other one - that
means stop using WKB in providers and common code paths, so the WKB
representation does not even get created (and cached).

One heretic idea at the end - what others think about postponing the
release of the new geometry architecture to 2.12 so that there is more
time to address the current issues (fix performance, fix high memory
consumption, clean up API, write unit tests). It seems to me that some
of the issues would be difficult to address even if the release of
2.10 is moved by another week or so.

Message-ID: <CAC2XbFfdHcAMzmzKPG2fPaUWfis3Q542e-o4NN7Mh5VygnHG=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Recently I have been looking a bit at the new geometry classes and
there is one thing I do not understand: if QgsLineStringV2 is derived
from QgsCurveV2 and QgsPolygonV2 is derived from QgsSurfaceV2, why is
not the same approach used for multi-part geometries? Currently
QgsMultiLineStringV2 and QgsMultiPolygonV2 are subclasses of
QgsGeometryCollectionV2 - but why they are not derived from
QgsMultiCurveV2 and QgsMultiSurfaceV2 respectively?

It looks like OGR uses that approach too (multi-polygon from
multi-surface and multi-linestring from multi-curve):

I'd be a cautious +1 to this - but I'm also concerned about the impact
of reverting this work now. Scary stuff, but like you said, I'm not
confident we can get the new geometry work into a release-ready shape
in 3 days... (Also, who is expected to do this? AFAIK all the
sponsored bug fixing has been exhausted for 2.10).

+1 to full postpone for me. I don't like the idea of shipping something
that is slower and snapping is slow. Those are core features of a GIS.

Out of curiosity, how long of a delay do you estimate would be needed to
fix things? 4 weeks, 8 weeks?

Hi Nyall

 >This potentially has huge impacts on the performance of common tasks 
such as selecting all features which intersect a geometry.

Are you really sure the impact is huge? If you select features on the 
map, you get a new one from provider each time. So also with the old 
geometry class, it was necessary to convert to geos for each intersect.

But yes, if several geos operations are done in sequence on really the 
same geometry instance, there is an overhead now. However, I would 
assume the geos conversion takes far less time than the geos operation 
itself. Did you observe cases where the geos conversion really takes 
very long time?

Lets assume the geos conversion indeed takes a long time. Couldn't we 
just store the pointer to QgsGeos (or better QgsGeometryEngine class) 
inside QgsGeometry? This would be straightforward to do. Furthermore, it 
is possible to prepare QgsGeos. A prepared geos geometry can do _much_ 
faster intersects/touches/ etc. operations if called repeatedly. We can 
cache a prepared QgsGeos now with the new engine, but we couldn't do 
that with the old QgsGeometry class. So for repeated predicate 
calculations, the new geometry is much better, also performance wise.

Marco

Hi!
I would be in favor of releasing it as is.

1. This is not the _LTS_ release (I thought this is exactly why we
introduced LTS) - so people should know that there are new features
which sometimes can cause "something"
2. releasing it with the changes means more feedback if this is really
a problem and more time with lots of testing to fix it until the next
LTS

Though there should probably a release note to make people aware and
ask them to test this very well.

kind regards
Werner

Thanks - I thought this was already asked, but couldn't find where...

IMO the hierarchy in QGIS should follow the one in ISO and OGC models.
Maybe right now there is no practical advantage for the implementation
to follow the hierarchy, but is there a strong reason to deviate from
it? It seems confusing that multi-polygon cannot be cast to
multi-surface. I am afraid that things like this can bite us later...

Well, if you have to ask and Nyall apparently is the first to notice - the
impact can't be huge.

I think reverting is no option - there have been numerous things that were
adapted to the new engine.

The indexing when snapping on a large layer is noticable however.  But I don't
think that's a huge issue either.   Some will complain - but there are other
things that don't work nicely on large layers either.

It's a reminder that new stuff should go in early in the development cycle and
not shortly before the feature freeze.  But that's just a future note.

I'd release what we have.

Hi Martin

Only a week reason ( clone() method ). But I think you are right and it 
might be better to follow the ISO model to be more compatible with other 
libs.

hello all 

i have an old project based on the 1.6 qgis version 
i need to update to the last version 2.8 and a new system ubuntu 14 

i have installed all dependencies requiered by qgis , everything works fine , ( qgiss, grass, python, qt, etc ... ) 
but when i try to build my old project i have a lot of error like no such file or directy because it seems that some classes or header file have been removed or renamed 

here is the header liste of my project : 

// QGIS Includes //

some of them doesn't appear in the class list on the web site of qgis 
for the 2.8 : http://qgis.org/api/2.8/annotated.html 
for the 1.6 : http://qgis.org/api/1.6/classes.html 

by exemple : qgssinglesymbolrenderer, qgsrenderer, qgsuniquevaluerenderer, and qgssymbologyutils give an error message no such file or directory 

i don't know how to build correctly my project because i don't know and i don't find the list of change , what files have been removed, renamed, fusionned ? 

thanks for your help

Hi Martin

The new geometries uses more memory for backward compatibility. In the 
mid/long term, the cached wkb will be removed, so QgsAbstractGeometry 
will be the only represention. The provider can feed wkb (e.g. database 
providers) or construct the geometry by feeding QgsPointV2s.

I'm however surprised that this should have such an impact with the 
attached dataset. Because the shp has size 588MByte, you could load that 
in memory several times (and we don't load everything into memory in 
QGIS in case the dataset is even bigger). Looking on the attached file, 
I think the problem is not the memory, but rather some round trips in 
the closestVertex function.

But it is far from something that would justify a release delay or even 
a geometry rollback.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

I don't think reverting the geometry work is an option.
It works well in general and offers really nice new possibilities with z
and m values and circular arcs despite it was merged a bit late, did not
receive a lot of attention in the freeze period and lacks some unit tests.

But then, should we spoil CPU cycles and memory just because it's
present on modern machines?
The way I see it, QGIS should also be able to run on limited hardware
like portable devices or older hardware.

IIRC implicitly shared geometries have been one of the features which
were an integral part of this from the beginning. If we don't have it
now but are able to add it later on I don't mind so much but I do mind
if we miss the oportunity to add it now.

So the question is, is this something that we can fix later on, or would
fixing it require an API break and therefore we need to wait for 3.0 if
we don't fix it now?

Regards,
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] beforeCommitChanges signal : equivalent to SQL
 BEFORE triggers' OLD and NEW values
Message-ID: <CAExk7p1i7Eur+aWtwCu7V-3tRv+P2B1G9Vi4ek3WMf2hPhusag@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

In SQL, using triggers, it's possible to pre-process values before
inserting/deleting/updating them. That's a very powerful feature for things
such as validation, formatting, logging modifications, timestamping,
caching, synchronization across table/databases, running other scripts, etc.

Is it possible to emulate this in QGIS with Python (so purely on client
side) ?
There is the QgsVectorLayer beforeCommitChanges signal, which is triggered
exactly at the correct time, but I didn't find a way to iterate through the
modified features, getting their OLD and NEW state.

I think it may be possible to implement it using the attributeValueChanged
(QgsFeatureId fid, int idx, const QVariant) and the geometryChanged
(QgsFeatureId fid, QgsGeometry geom) signals to store a list of NEW states,
and then make a new query to the data provider to get the OLD states (using
QgsVectorDataProvider getFeatures).

Would that work ? It's a bit sad that there's a new query to make to the
provider. The best would be to have the attributeValueChanged and the
geometryChanged signals to return the OLD value as well directly. Would
this be a reasonable feature request ?

Or is there another way to achieve the same result that I didn't think of ?

Thanks a lot,

Olivier

That's why the subject line says "potentially" ;)

My biggest concern was operations such as the "Select by location"
operations, where a single feature is compared against all the other
features in a second layer. In this case there would be benefit from
retaining the geos representation between each comparison. However,
I've just run some tests and there's no appreciable difference in the
time required for selecting intersecting features from large layers
using this algorithm between 2.8->2.10, so you're correct in that the
geos conversion isn't very expensive. (Unfortunately, as Martin has
pointed out, memory usage in 2.10 was up by 50%).

Agreed - when PostGIS flipped their intersects operation to utilise
prepared geometries the difference was huge. I'm excited to see this
taken advantage of in QGIS too! I'm still a bit unclear as to where
you are taking these classes though. Is the intention that eventually
ALL operations will be done using QgsGeos? Because if not, then I
can't see anyway to actually utilise the prepared geometries as it
stands now - none of the methods in QgsGeometry utilise these.

Please don't take my reservations as attacking this work. I think it's
great stuff, and generally has been quite painless since it landed,
which is surprising given the extent of the work. I just want to make
sure 2.10 is in the best shape it can be in, and I'm doubtful that we
are release ready yet.

My biggest concern is honestly having the current QgsGeometryV2 API
locked in while there are still questions regarding how it's
implemented. Could we put a giant "NOT STABLE API AND MAY CHANGE" for
all these classes, so that we can address any unforeseen issues in
2.12?

mmmm... I'm not in favour of treating non LTS releases as "beta" type
releases though. There's been potentially 10s of thousands of dollars
of investment in 2.10, and people who have sponsored features are
still expecting a stable release when 2.10 comes out.

As I mentioned in an earlier reply, could we mark this component of
the API as non-stable for 2.10? That would give us the possibility of
later revision.

IIRC it wouldn't be the first time this has been done - I think the
labeling API was initially marked as experimental and non stable
too...

Hi,
I don't know exactly what happened, but it works now. I can launch my own
model from the plugin.

This is the final code :

model = ModelerAlgorithm.ModelerAlgorithm.fromFile(file_path)
model.provider = Processing.modeler
Processing.modeler.algs.append(model)
command_line = model.commandLineName()
Processing.algs['model'][command_line] = model
return command_line

runalg shows by default the QgsMessageBar. We will see if we need it or if
we need to change processing.
Thanks again Victor.

Etienne

Good to see that it works :-)

For the record, and in case you are interested in checking it, it
might be worth having a look at the "add model from file" action. It
is a different approach, just adding the file to the model folder and
refreshing the model provider, but just in case it is useful for you.
It will also make the model available for the user, outside of your
plugin context

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/python/plugins/processing/modeler/AddModelFromFileAction.py

Regarding the progress indication, once you have your algorithm with
parameters set, you can execute it using the AlgorithmExecutor class,
which accepts a progress object as parameter. That should let you
redirect the output messages and progress indications. Notice that
this might change soon, since there is a multithreading implementation
of that class being written at the moment.

Let me know if you have more questions

Cheers

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use the style tab widget in a Python plugin
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4DZQyR33e0wWUtjqTqhExwSWiYrfnOsbU6FxUz+RbWyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

The LayerBoard plugin I made during the HF in "Nooooooooodebo" shows a
table of all vector (and raster) layers and allows to edit some properties
directly by editing the table cells, such as max and min scale, layer name,
title and abstract, assign SRS, etc.

I would like to display the content of the Style tab of the layer
properties dialog in a panel right to the table. This tab will show the
style interface refreshed whenever the user clicks on a layer in the tab,
and let her/him change the style for this layer the same way we do via the
layer properties dialog.

I have searched a bit in the api and in the source code, but cannot find
the right way to do so. I have not found a custom Widget which I can
instantiate with the layer and wich will provide me all the logic
underneath.

Is this even possible ? Has anyone an idea of how to to this without
rewriting all the code ( connection between ui elements and slots)

Thanks in advance

Micha?l

Hum...
After digging a little deeper, I found something interesting in the Python
Cookbook [1]
It seems I need to use the class QgsRendererV2Widget

In the end, yes, everything should go through QgsGeometryEngine 
interface. There are two possibilities:

1. client code creates QgsGeos, calls prepare() on it and makes repeaded 
intersection(), etc. directly on QgsGeometryEngine. This can be done 
with master branch as is.

2. client code uses QgsGeometry and calls intersection() on it. To 
benefit from prepared geometries, we would need to enhance QgsGeometry 
to cache QgsGeos and call prepare() the first time it is used.

Thinking about it, version 1 might be better. We cannot know if the 
cached QgsGeos is really needed a second time and it might use more 
memory if not. In the first case, the client code knows if it is 
intended to do repeaded operations on the same geometry.

What do you think?

That would be ok.

Marco

Hi,

To all who have an interest in contributing to a DXF/DWG import function 
in QGIS:

I have started working on a requirements document - you can view it here:
https://docs.google.com/a/qgis.org/document/d/1NJv1lwd5TnWdV-fTuW7g5ts1O8r3vb46xYeAIQ_BwGw/edit?usp=sharing

If you want to contribute to the document, please send me your gmail 
account so I can give you write access.

After a couple of days (maybe 1.5-2 weeks) we can hopefully finish this 
document and ask for a quote. I will then ask again for organizations or 
companies who can contribute financially.

Thank you in advance for your support!

Andreas

Ok, it seems python bindings are missing here. Here is the console output

>>> from qgis.gui import *
>>> from qgis.core import *
>>> rw = QgsRendererV2Widget( iface.activeLayer(),
QgsStyleV2.defaultStyle() )
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: qgis._gui.QgsRendererV2Widget represents a C++ abstract class
and cannot be instantiated

Too bad ;)

Hi Michael

The QgsRendererV2Widget is really just abstract base class meant to be
implemented by custom implementations of renderers.

I think you are looking for this:

from qgis.gui import *
w=QgsRendererV2PropertiesDialog(iface.activeLayer(),
QgsStyleV2.defaultStyle(), True)
w.show()

Cheers
Martin

Hello,

In my project test I can't zoom in more than 1:2,256. When I try to zoom more, 
the map moves (ie pan).

I built from the last commit today (few mn ago). Does someone have the same 
behaviour?

Thanks,

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the help. Now I can display the widget in my scrollArea. I have
still have some crashes, but this is the way to go. I will then need to set
the layer style via a custom "apply" button

Cheers,
Michael

I remember having had troubles with high zoom values, with rendering
going wild. Did you try with an old version ?

Hi Yves,

just rebuild, and cannot reproduce this, both in our national crs and
3856 with OpenLayers layers.

did you try to disable all plugins, or try a fresh configuration?

Dear Andreas,

beside "Import of layer names as attributes" I would prefer
1. setting layer filter in the import dialog (e.g. as a regexp or a
    selection list from the available CAD layers), unselected layers are
    skipped in input.
    It is not clear for me if the layer name rules can be used for this
    purpose.
2. import each CAD layer into separate QGIS layers by feature type (point,
    annotation, polyline, polygon), it could be a checkbox in the import
    dialog.

Optionally during the import polygon layers sould be cheched for islands 
(polygons inside other polygon) and remove the area of islands from the 
container polygon.

Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Zoltan,

I added these two requirements in the document. However, with the new 
legend options introduced in QGIS 2.8 you can easily toggle the 
visibility of classes or rules or delete certain rules - so I am not 
100% convinced if this option is really necessary.

Thanks for your reply!

Andreas

This sounds like the right approach to me, but I have a couple of
further questions:
- For methods which don't have a geos implementation (eg,
QgsGeometry::smooth ), should they just be implemented in the
QgsGeometryEngine base class?
- I'm a bit concerned about the usability of this approach for plugin
developers. It means that they'd need to be aware that QGIS uses geos
for these geometry operations and use that QgsGeos is the class
required for geometry relation/modification operations. That's not
obvious and could be a stumbling block for new PyQGIS developers. It
also locks these plugins then into using the geos engine, and if we
ever decided to switch to a different engine then the plugins would
also need to be updated.
Just thinking aloud here... is there a good reason we couldn't instead
move these geos implementations to QgsGeometryEngine itself and do
away with QgsGeos? Then, in the (unlikely?) situation that a geos
implementation is inferior to a native QGIS method we can
mix-and-match between geos and alternative implementations as
required.

Great! That's my biggest reservation - if we've got the opportunity to
tweak the API for 2.12 then my fears have been unfounded :)

Hi Nyall

They can stay in QgsGeometry as they don't require conversion to a 
different format and they would not benefit from prepare().

>It means that they'd need to be aware that QGIS uses geos

Ideally, they work just with QgsGeometryEngine and don't realize which 
library is behind it.

>is there a good reason we couldn't instead
>move these geos implementations to QgsGeometryEngine itself and do
>away with QgsGeos?


See above. QgsGeos is a subclass of QgsGeometryEngine. The only thing to 
be done is probably to move the method 
QgsGeometryEditUtils::geometryEngine() to a better place (e.g. 
QgsGeometry) and add python bindings for it. That way, plugin 
programmers just get the recommended subclass (obviously QgsGeos) and 
work with the base class interface.

>and do
>away with QgsGeos?


Do you mean remove the python bindings for QgsGeos? Agreed, it will be 
good to discourage the direct use of the subclass.

Regards,
Marco

@R?gis: I will double check with a fresh project. But as I don't have any 
problem with QGIS 2.8 I though it was not a project issue.

@sandro: it was a fresh build

@Richard: I will test without any plugin.

Hi, 
great work !

I noticed an issue when changing streetview panel size, street view image is
not redimensionned (under chrome at least). 

Do you redistribute your sources and packages somewhere? 

I aw you plan to work on Lizmap later, can you tell us a bit more? 

Cheers

I've got the build environment up now, I think - many thanks, all. However,
does anyone know how I can get rid of the following test fail:

QPixmap: Must construct a QApplication before a QPaintDevice

I don't see QApplication instantiated anywhere. I'm not sure how to get past
this, since the fail is early on, so I don't get to the important tests for
the plugin.

Hi R?gis

Thanks for your answer. I already done it, this way :
https://github.com/3liz/QgisLayerBoardPlugin/commit/c212b42af4ee2b73b4a087d7f8fda9b3dfd823e3

Basically I am using the QgsRendererV2PropertiesDialog, and then use its
method "apply"

I will release a new version today.

Now I need to figure out the equivalent of QgsRendererV2PropertiesDialog for
raster layers

Cheers

Micha?l

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QDataStream reading from QProcess or stdin
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYrwNF-f4X7Nt_ff0-_awCdPW9AwbXCpdoz=bFMyt3UZiw@mail.gmail.com>

Does anybody have experience with QDataStream reading from QProcess or
QFile.open(stdin,QIODevice::ReadOnly )? At the beginning I naively
thought that it just works cross platform. Looking closer, it does not
seem so obvious, see also [1][2]. What I am observing (currently on
Linux) is that if there are no data on the device, reading from
QDataStream is not blocked until data are available, it sets an error
and continues. In theory, the underlying QIODevice::readData should
block, Qt doc states:

"When reimplementing this function it is important that this function
reads all the required data before returning. This is required in
order for QDataStream to be able to operate on the class. QDataStream
assumes all the requested information was read and therefore does not
retry reading if there was a problem."

I looked briefly into QProcess code and it seems to be blocking,
unfortunately in practice it is not. Am I missing some options, mode
settings? Do I have to write my blocking QIODevice subclasses?

The message says it all. You must instantiate QApplication before
instantiating QPaintDevice object or any object from classes inherited from
QPaintDevice.

So Google has told me repeatedly. My issues are:

- I have not previously done this because the plugin works fine in QGIS, and
this issue has only shown up in tests

- I don't know how (or where) to instantiate QApplication (or
QgsApplication?)

I don't know the code base you're working on. I think what you need to do
is to narrow down which test that produces that error. You can split the
tests like binary search or whatever method you like (running the tests for
each package etc). In InaSAFE, for testing purposes, there's a handy
function called get_qgis_app that will instantiate a QgsApp. It is used in
the tests which also to prevent that error. See here for the usage of that
function
https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=get_qgis_app

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Change vector layer data source

Hi,

I am working on the Visual changelog for QGIS 2.10 and I came across 
http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/2.10/entry/allow-changing-vector-layer-data-source/update/

However, this does not work for me, or I can't figure it out how to 
change a vector data source.

Also - does it only work for files or also for database sources?

Could someone please explain how this works?

Thanks,
Andreas

PS: could someone please accept my entries so that they appear in the 
public list?

Hey Andreas,

That is a API only change the moment for vector layers only.

There was a bug in the method which Nyall has fixed in the last few days so
you might be on a older version.

Hi Nathan,

So if it is only accessible to programmers then it should be moved into 
the category "Programmability". Currently, it is listed under Plugins.

It would be cool if someone who knows could write some code snippet for 
this entry to explain how to use it.

Thanks for letting me know,
Andreas

Hi,

I wanted to update this entry

get a 500 error code. The only difference to other entries is that I

I created a few more unapproved visual changelog entries (new and updated).

Which QGIS devs have the power to approve these? Is it only Tim, or are 
there other QGIS devs who can do it as well?

There are still a few entries that would need some more descriptive text 
and/or screenshots - entries I can't do, because I don't know enough

Hi Andreas,

thanks for your work. I do have some admin rights, but currently I only
see one 'Pending Approval' entry, from rldhont: Add DescribeLayer method
to WMS. I do not see other entries from you.

Tim took this task, and may have other (django)'views' then I do. I do
not know of other devs...

But I reckon Tim will do this this week, maybe asking for some input and
shortly after he 'flags the entries as finished' I will incorporate them
in the website.

At all: please have a look and give constructive input:

http://changelog.qgis.org/qgis/version/2.8/

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

All three are fixed in qgis-dev-2.9.0-105 which also switched to grass-7.0.1RC1.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] LayerBoard plugin - edit project layers properties
 while drinking coffea !
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO51CvV4ApR+nsVbrqf=o1zxPxW8iyPqoZfKtwAAbDtvyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I am excited to announce the new version 0.5 of my LayerBoard plugin I
started during Nodebo Developper Meeting. It is still experimental but
begins to have the features I was alway looking for when dealing with
complex projects.

Please test it and report issues, or propose Pull requests ! Any feedback
welcome !

Here is the copy of the README file visible in the github repository [1]

------------------------------8<-------------------------------

This plugin helps to see and modify properties for vector and raster layers.

It shows the layers in a table sheet, and the user can directly modify some
properties such as layer name, title, abstract, minimum and maximum scales.
To do so, double-click on a cell and modify the value. The modified cells
are then drawn in yellow, and you can apply or discard the changes via the
button under the table.

Some properties can be changed on multiple layers at once, such as
modifying spatial reference system and scale based visibility. To do so,
select one or more layers in the vector or raster table, and use the right
panel tools in the "Actions on Layers" tab, such as CRS or Max Scale, the
click on the corresponding "Set" button.

Some actions can be performed on multiple layers at once:

   - create a spatial index ( done only on vector layers)
   - save current style as default : it creates a QML file beside the
   source file

The information visible in the "Vector layers" or "Raster layers" tabs can
be exported to a "Comma Separated Values" (CSV) text file via the button in
the tab "Export" of the right panel

When only one layers is selected, the tab "Layer style" in the right panel
displays the current layers style, and you can change the style directly
for the selected layer via the "Apply" button. This is only available for
vector layers.

IMPORTANT : the changes are made in the current project, and will be saved
only if you save the project.

I meant version 0.4, not 0.5 (too much excitment)
By the way, thanks to all who have given me ideas and helped me figure out
how to use some part of the QGIS api.

I already had a similar get_qgis_app() function, but I was only using it to
instantiate QgsApplication in tests which I thought had QIcon or QPixmap
functionality. Adding it to all other tests has solved the problem. Thanks
so much for your patience.

I approved all pending entries. Etienne Trimaille and I will spend the day tomorrow tidying up the change log. If anyone has more content please pass it along for me (both for new or existing entries). Some of the entries are take quite a bit of time to generate screenshots for (e.g. anyone have 3d point cloud rending screenies?) so any help with nice screenshots will also be appreciated.

Regards

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] crash when accessing geometry from Python console
Message-ID: <558BA316.5070108@jena.de>

Hi everybody,

I try to do the following from the Python console:
g=iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0].geometry()
returns a QgsGeometry objekt but as soon as I want to do anything with 
it QGIS crashes (layer is a memory line layer but a PostGIS linestring 
layer behaves the same). Any request like
g.type()
g.length()
g.anything crashes QGIS
g.asPolyline() crash if the line has three vertices, with only two 
vertices it returns an empty array.

My goal is not the Python console but a plugin; the plugin crashes, too :-(

tested with 2.8 on Win7 (64bit) and 2.8 & 2.9 on Ubuntu (64 bit) so it 
should not be connected to the geometry overhaul I reckon.

any help appreciated

Bernhard

Hm,

the following code returns the geometry ok:
for feat in iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures():
   g=feat.geometry()
   break

Hi Martin,

I was not aware of this bug, thanks for pointing me towards it. As 
posted previously I found a workaround but if I use 
geometryAndOwnership() as proposed in #777 do I have to do anything like
g = None to destroy the geometry or will Python take care of that as 
soon as my script has been finished?

thank you for your help

Bernhard

Hi,

Thanks for trying it out. About StreetView it's true that on first click
panel is not fully resized, but when you continue working with it, it's OK.
So I think not so annoying, but will definitely have to take a look.

I plan to publish GitHub repository with all the code and setup
instructions and welcoming other users to contribute to the project.
Currently I have some work on cleaning up the code and writing setup
procedure.

About LizMap I plan to take the latest version and make a demo out of same
QGIS project I'm using already. That way users will be able to compare
different clients with same data.

regards,
Uros

Hi,

The savest option is to use

QgsGeometry( feat.geometry() )

This does currently work and will continue to work in the future once
issue #777 is resolved,

Cheers,
Matthias

Hi Matthias,

thank you, this works:
feat = iface.activeLayer().selectedFeatures()[0]
g = QgsGeometry(feat.geometry())

I fixed it - seems like having brackets in the image credits was the cause. By the way you can always go into the admin backend if needed to tweak entries (and you are staff):

Sorry for the hassle

I also searched QGIS code on GitHub. I found that there is no 
cmTC_94742.vcxproj in QGIS source code inside Github.


Please help in resolving this issue.

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Example with curves for changeling
Message-ID: <ABD02355-0682-4BF8-9FC9-D28B3CC6F6B5@kartoza.com>

Hi

Has anyone played with curves support? At the hackfest Marco showed me digitising tools but I believe these are not going to be in 2.10 right? So for the changelog we can only say that we support curved geometries? I tried this simple test:

-- Table: curves

DROP TABLE curves;

CREATE TABLE curves
(
  id bigserial NOT NULL,
  geometry geometry(CURVEPOLYGON, 4326),
  name text,
  CONSTRAINT p_key PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

insert into curves values (1, st_geomfromtext('CURVEPOLYGON(CIRCULARSTRING(1 1,1 2, 2 2, 2 1, 1 1))', 4326), 'test');


And then added curves layer QGIS successfully. It seems that the curves are still represented as segmented polygons for now using the above example. Is that the expected experience or am I doing something wrong?

Regards

Tim

Hi Tim

 >Is that the expected experience or am I doing something wrong

That is the expected experience, the digitizing tools are coming after 
2.10 (construction tools and node tool with z-/m support). Symbology, 
edit tool and other tools still segmentize the geometries at the moment.

Marco

wouldn't it be better not to mention it at all in the changelog if it 
isn't really visible to the user? Better to mention it at the next release.

Just my opinion.

That's the point: both saga and gdal are installed and working, from standard package, but not found. My guess is that registry or path from earlier installations interfere with this.
Thanks.

Hi Tim,

I don't know how to access and use the admin framework. I don't find 
anything in the menu.

Anyway. I changed four more entries but can't find where I can approve them.

Thanks,

Well, the thing which is visible to the user is that it is now possible 
to load and visualize layers with curved geometries. This was not 
possible in previous versions.

Its not in the menu (its not normally intended for end-users to use) - its at the link I gave here:

http://changelog.qgis.org/site-admin/changes/entry/ <http://changelog.qgis.org/site-admin/changes/entry/>

I made you a staff and super user so you can approve entries, make other users admin etc.

Hi people,

the new version was just branched off, the new tar ball[1] was made and
packaging can begin and the feature freeze on master is now over.

The new version will be announced once packages for some platforms are
available.

	are locked using a preset
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GYi2iZ0TSSGjGS2QvoPfaP_kTCCnTWWxu6TNch4CAL6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Can someone confirm that Legend filter (composer) is not working if you use
presets to lock the layers in composer. It simply filters all layers, like
if no features are represented on the map.

The same does not seem to happen if one simply lock the layers from current
map canvas state.

This is happening in master 492c6d9
<https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/492c6d9>,windows 7 64 bits

Thanks.

I suspect I'm not going to get this to work. I hit the problem that my plugin
's code used iface, which was not recognised. I managed to inject the dummy
iface replacement created in the qgis_get_app () function mentioned above.
However, next the code calls:

```python
IFACE.legendInterface().groupLayerRelationship()

```

While the dummy iface implements a method legendInterface(), it's just a
stub. It doesn't even return the right object type, but returns a canvas
object instead. 

I might be able to expand the dummy iface to add in the extra features
required to get the right object type returned by that method, but isn't
this all pointless? 

- the more dummy object I have to build, the less real object I am testing

- the dummy won't have the session data associated with it, such as the
project's layers

An I misunderstanding something, or is my attempt to set up testing for
qgis2web doomed?

Hi Tim,

How can I add the "funded by" and "developed by" links for entries? Is
this a manual thing?

Sorry, figured this out. Follow up question: Is there a consensus
about adding "developed by" for non funded features? I noticed that
currently these tags have only been added for sponsored features...

Hi Nyall,

These are manual entries.

And yes - I think that most entries should have a "developed by" and 
"funded by" entry. I simply did not know for many of them who developed 
and funded it.

Hi all, 

My fifth report is already available on my blog [1].
As always feel free to comment the report or even to give suggestions about the multithread implementation

The code is not yet available due to a crash with SAGA algorithms but after solving this issue I will merge the local branch on dev.

Have a nice week, 
Marcus Santos

Hi all,
While executing Osgeo4w in "Advanced Install" mode to update/upgrade all my
QGIS versions, it offers me to install 2.10 at the place of 2.8. As 2.8 is
a Long Term Release, I think it should be kept till another LTR and 2.10
should have a new entry.
Am I wrong?

Yes.  2.10 is a regular release.  2.8 is qgis-ltr.  See also the download page.

I do know. Does it mean that, still through osgeo4w install process, user
can not install both 2.8 and 2.10?

I don't get what I should see in the download page. All still refers to 2.8
(unless I have a cache issue on my browser)

They can install qgis (2.10, release-2_10 branch), qgis-ltr (2.8.x, release-2_8
branch) and qgis-dev (2.11, master branch) in parallel if they like.

Well, just that ltr packages will be appear once 2.10 is out.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS QgsGeometry.fromWkt not accepting polygons
	with Z values?
Message-ID: <BCF6B63AE0B25941A7F56567B58A280570CD37D2@allkexa1.NIRAS.INT>

Hi!

I have previously been able to use the QGIS plugin QuickWKT to conveniently visualize geometries in QGIS. This has worked well using both 2D and 3D data where only the 2D part has been visualized. Recently I haven't been able to insert WKT polygons with Z-values.

I have tried the following in the Python console:

> g = QgsGeometry.fromWkt('Polygon((0 0 0, 0 1 0, 1 1 0, 0 0 0))')
> f = QgsFeature()
> f.setGeometry(g)
> iface.activeLayer().dataProvider().addFeatures([f])

My active layer is a scratch layer configured as Polygon. I get no exceptions and QGIS reports the layer containing 1 feature but nothing is shown. I have altered the above four python lines to only have the X and Y values and this results in a visual result.

Repeating the above using a Point WKT instead works fine with both 2D and 3D data.

Is something broken in the WKT parser for polygons?

I am using the weekly QGIS windows x64 release 61d81f0 and I wonder if this has something to do with the new geometry classes Marco wrote about on this list in late May 2015?

Hello,

now that the feature freeze is over, can somebody please merge the QGIS
server refactoring PR?

This would bring python bindings for the server library and python tests
for QGIS server.

A first python test is already in the PR but more test can be added once
the refactoring is merged.

This is the PR:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2092

Travis build failed because in that period it was broken.

This is the test:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/2092/files#diff-260b51384025856fac2dc9682481a865

Well. not that new.  The notes about the ltr packages are from Apr 14th
(although "once the is a new latest release" was replaced with 2.10 on May
11th).

But that note is gone in the website repository, just the website hasn't been
rebuilt yet

The debian/ubuntu packages for ltr are still building - there were minor
problems with the nightly build of all the packages.  Not that hard to fix, but
you loose a lot of time, when each attempt takes several hours to complete (or
fail).

We build packages for 8 distribution(s/variants) for two architectures (32/64
bit), that take about half an hour each - and this time there were nightly,
regular and long term release to build...

Hi,

Exhuming this old thread: like Paolo, I can't make work the "Enable
snapping on intersection". I guess this is supposed to allow snapping on
intersection of different geometries even when no vertex is present.

Looking at the code, it seems the only place where it may be used is
within QgsMapCanvasSnapper::snapToBackgroundLayers()
And this code seems never called by anything in the core ...
I then suppose it has been removed from the core and kept here for
plugins that might use it ??

Can you rebase and force push to your branch so that Travis can
recheck? Just to be extra safe :)

Hmm... it works for me. Indeed it is meant to snap to intersections
within a layer and also between different layers. There was a
regression in that functionality in 2.10 cycle, but got fixed before
the release. Works both for line and polygon layers.

It is also supported in the new API (QgsSnappingUtils).

Done.

I re-added your labeling #ifdef in latest commit.

Travis is happy :)

Indeed ! I was apparently using a version with the regression. Works
fine with the last master.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Difference between two layers doesn't remove any
	features
Message-ID: <CAMtDFL+Pv0B6qY10QPFWS_Am3CRhadi4n+8uMKMpeTOmKnV_Gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi dev,

I'm using qgis master and I'm trying to use the difference tool between two
layers (from the vector menu and processing).

On the map canvas, the result looks fine, I get less features displayed.
However my result layer contains exactly the same number of features than
my original layer.

Running the "check validity" from processing, I get a lot of "Unknown
geometry type 0".
I can't use this layer in any processing algorithm :

"QgsFeature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry): argument 1 has unexpected type
'NoneType'"

I don't know which algorithms may be affected by this kind of bug.

It's working fine on qgis 2.8.

Regards,
Etienne

Hi,

Interesting new tool for testing QGIS's WMS client meets 1.3 spec:

"OGC now provides a WMS 1.3 Client Test that client developers can use to
confirm that their clients correctly implement the OGC Web Map Service 1.3
Interface Standard."

http://www.opengeospatial.org/blog/2244

Wonder if other test clients for OWS specifications will follow soon?

You can also use iface object provided by Python wrapper from qgis.utils.
So in get_qgis_app instead of having the mock QgisInterface, you can do
something like:

```
from qgis.utils import iface
IFACE = iface
```

I think in InaSAFE, we don't want unnecessary implementations from the
iface from qgis.utils. I am not aware of the first history of it though.

I just looked at the code base. If you are patient enough to get that
sorted out, I can look at that around the weekend and make a PR. One of the
problem is I see that you are playing around with get_qgis_app in the main
code (MainDialog). That function is only intended for testing purpose.

Any instance of qgis_get_app() outside of /test is only my attempts to get
his testing working, so I'll dig out the commit which put it there and
revert it. I'll have a look at your guidance on implementing iface, but if
you are able and interested to have a look as well, then of course I'd be
extremely grateful, whether this weekend or later.

Thanks again for all the help

Hi all.
Just upgraded from standard repo, on Debian sid. I consistently get a
segafault when starting normally. No segfault when from a clean
configpath. No message froom the console. I have a lot of settings and
plugins, so bisecting would take a long time. Any hint on how to debug this?
Thanks.

The qscintilla2 transition may be responsible for this, it was just
updated in Debian unstable which requires rebuild of all its reverse
dependencies. That probably hasn't happened yet for the upstream qgis
packages.

Thanks a lot. Just out of curiosity: why then a clean configpath does
not trigger the segfault?
All the best.

Don't know, so it may not be the problem.

Hi,

I didn't have time to investigate this issue, but with the new geometry
engine supporting Z/M geometries, I feel that WKT parser should support Z.
I'd suggest you to file a ticket (if there is not already one).

Delete rows (there may be two) with expandedPaths from ~/.config/QGIS/QGIS2.conf

Confirmed: it crashes again on a clean config when opening a subfolder.
This makes the program pretty unusable.
Should a open a ticket?

When opening a subfolder in the browser? Try to find the guilty
provider setting QGIS_PROVIDER_FILE regexp environment variable, for
example:

QGIS_PROVIDER_FILE=gdal qgis

and so on for all suspicious providers.

We are talking about master or 2.10?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS crashes when stopping editing mode
Message-ID: <f33af476185a44b69327ca377dc6e3c9@Exchange1.fugro.de>

Hi everybody,

QGIS crashes when discarding all changes made to a vector layer.

I'm writing a plugin to access and modify the attribute table while the layer is in editing mode. When starting the editing mode, I change the attribute values for each new feature with the coordinates from canvas and other given information. When the editing mode stops without saving anything, QGIS crashes giving me a hint with a dump file. The error message is attached (sorry, that it is in german).

I use QGIS 2.8.1 on Windows 8 Pro, 64-bit. My QGIS is in 32-bit to deal with databases. Find attached my minimal python script.

Do you have any ideas how to solve this problem?

Thank you
Christian B?hnke

PS: Curiosly, a few minutes ago it took QGIS 4 times to crash, when discarding all changes to my vector layer. At the fifth time, it crashed.

I'm sure someone has this in mind, but the countdowns on the QGIS home page
to next feature freeze and release are both on 0 since we passed the release
date.

we are just waiting for some packaging/site updates, if those are ready
we do the actual release and rebuild the site with new url's/time's etc...

Hello,

I've recently posted a new plugin named SpreadsheetLayer on QGIS 
official repository.
After that I've received some remarks about metadata file content, which 
I've corrected.

So I've reposted the plugin, but it does not seem to have been published 
yet on QGIS plugin repository.

Can somebody take a look at this ?

Best regards.

Yep, confirmed here on a fresh Debian self compiled version.

When I open the browser panel 'files' part en start to browse QGIS
crashes... also when clicking on 'Favourites' (which only contains a
link to my nl folder)...

Seems to be related to the spatialite stuff.. (I still have spatialite
crashes/cannot use saveAs too_:

Thanks Even,

we can probably get around this using mutex in QgsGdalLayerItem if
Spatialite is < 4.2.
Can we get somehow SPATIALITE_412_OR_LATER or bSpatialiteGlobalLoaded
from GDAL API or its headers  ?

The final SpatiaLite 4.3.0 release will be soon (see the recent thread on
the spatialite-users list). [1]

I hope to start the spatialite transition in Debian soon after its release
to finally get rid of the problematic SpatiaLite 4.1.1 now that it's
rebuild with PROJ.4 4.9.1. [2][3]

Radim,

I can't think a way of getting those internal details from the outside.

However if the (external) spatialite version available when compiling QGIS is 
< 4.2, then it is very likely that the one used when compiling GDAL is also < 
4.2

The configure test used by GDAL is:
AC_CHECK_LIB(spatialite,spatialite_target_cpu,SPATIALITE_412_OR_LATER=yes,SPATIALITE_412_OR_LATER=no)

You could also fallback to runtime checks with SELECT spatialite_version()

This assumes a setup where not too odd things happen, i.e. compiling with a 
version and updating it between compilation of various software components.

What time horizon do you see for the new SpatiaLite to get to Debian?

Is there a chance to release 2.10.1?

I expect that we can start the spatialite transition soon after its
release, but this mostly depends on the Release Team which manages the
transitions.

The scope of the spatialite transition is quite limited, it mostly
collides with the packages in the gdal transition that's currently blocked
from starting by the uncoordinated mapnik 3 transition.

There is also the uncoordinated libdap transition which prevents testing
migration of the gdal package, that needs to be resolved before the
spatialite transition can start.

I expect the spatialite to happen during the 4 month life of the 2.10
release, but with vacations and DebConf starting in the next 2 months we
may not make it if the Release Team doesn't give the go-ahead for the
spatialite transition soon after its final release.

Ah, sorry, the question about 2.10.1 was more for Jef, I mean if it
makes sense to do the workaround with mutex in QGIS and backport it to
2.10 branch.
Anyway, seeing the terms in Debian, we have to fix it in master.

There will be a 2.10.1 - because of cc13c57 [0].

Odd, that 72c9830 went in right before feature freeze, went unnoticed for all
of it and is discovered right after release - even before the announcement.

Not sure if we should do 2.10.1 right away, maybe there's more...

This post is in no way a criticism of any of the QGIS team and their
monumental efforts or their fabulous product. However, I thought someone
should question how successful the four-monthly release schedule is. 2.8
immediately needed 2.8.1, and there seems to be the chance that 2.10 is
immediately going to need 2.10.1.

Is the predestined release schedule meaning that the devs simply cannot test
as much as they need? Alternatively, should the feature freeze be extended?

Anyway, keep up the fabulous work, all of you. My organization has never
looked back since migrating to QGIS, and it is only getting better and
better.

Thanks

Tom

I think it's a well known fact that .0 releases are more likely to have
bugs than any other release. Many sysadmins just refuse to install those
ones :)

One big step forward has been made this year for QGIS, which is the
concept of "long term releases". Of the ones you mention (2.8 and 2.10)
only 2.8 is a long term release, and it is actually at its 2nd patch
round (2.8.2). I'm sure sysadmins are still in love with 2.8, which is
also getting more love toward a 2.8.3 which already has 115 commits pending.

The next LTR will be 2.14, planned one year after the previous LTR.
In that occasion the feature freeze period be one month longer.
Full details are here:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/blob/master/QEP-4-QGIS_Long_Term_Releases.rst

Where do you see possible improvements could be placed ?
How could you help making them possible ?

My point, if my understanding and memory of the last few months is correct,
is that these two .1 releases have been required (2.8.1) or identified as
required (2.10.1), before each .0 version has been fully released. My
argument is that that is not the same as the normal caution about .0
versions, but is rather a potentially more serious problem. 

I would change nothing at this stage. The new schedule is still bedding in.
However, if 2.12.1 is required as quickly, I do think it should be
reconsidered. A longer feature freeze? Six-monthly releases? I am not
qualified to give much of an informed opinion on that. As everyone says,
non-LTRs are not betas.

In an open source project I see testing more a job for users and not for devs.
That's why we have all those nightly builds that users could test.  In feature
freeze the users should test more, report and the devs should fix what's
reported.

If the devs also had do all the testing (including coming up with all sorts of
environments), we'd probably never got as far as we are.  We're only a few
devs, but a lot of users.  While that usually applies to all software, I
imagine that our ratio is still different.

I might be wrong, but to me the fact that 2.8 and 2.10 instantly needed a point
release is more a sign that still not enough people (ie. users) participate in
testing QGIS before the release.

If all the opportunity of preliminary testing was used, the .0 rule ideally
wouldn't even apply to us.  As we'd all work together to get master into a good
state to release - and after the release just establish that we've done a good
job on it.

I doubt that revising the schedule would change that - but it might just make
investing in features less attractive.

Still if we find there are more serious reports during feature freeze than we
can cope with, we can see if the schedule need revision - but I think that this
wasn't the case in either 2.8 or 2.10.

Hi

In my opinion, this has nothing to do with the release schedule. It has 
mainly two reasons:

- QGIS is quite a large project. So testing really everything (including 
complex interaction of different modules with GUI) is impossible.

- There is a lot of development activity in QGIS. More development = 
more possibility of unexpected side effects.

A longer feature freeze wouldn't help. The thing which does help is the 
2.8 version.

Regards,
Marco

Hello

Just one curiosity: are unit tests run on all main platforms before 
release? Apparently the nasty OgrConnectionPool issue triggered a 
failure in the test suite on OS X, whereas on Linux it did not. So this 
might be something worth considering for future releases.

Best,
Sandro

They are run every night - currently for different version of debian/ubuntu,
windows and osx.

But there virtually always have been a lot of tests (see dash[0]; starting at
the HF in Lyon), that fail at least on some of the platforms (including only
some of the debian/ubuntu version), so that's not a clear indicator for real
bugs.  Hence the outcome has never been reliable enough to mean anything
without taking a closer look at the results.

Matthias fixed a bunch of the tests, when Travis was introduced.  But still
disabled a couple of the flaky tests just in the travis configuraton and also
added some new control images to make some others pass.

I've been meaning to post an update on this, so may as well do it now...

Following up Matthias' work on Travis, he and I (+some friendly
goblins) have been doing a lot of work to get the test suite behaving
well on other platforms. This has mostly consisted of making the test
suites more robust so they behave nicely cross platform, plus a small
amount of identifying and addressing real issues. We're getting
getting much closer, and comparing dash from the start of 2015 [1] to
yesterday [2] shows just how much progress has been made. (Today's
builds should look even better).

Here's where we currently stand:
- On linux platforms almost all of the tests should pass. The
exception is qgis_legendrenderertest, which requires a bit of tweaking
to handle different sized renderered/control images. There's some
(potentially real issues) failures on 2.11.0-wheezy-amd64, which I
still need to investigate and are probably related to dependency
packaging issues on that distro.

- Again, the tests should mostly pass on OSX, with the exception again
of the legend renderer and possibly the server tests (I haven't been
able to get a server build running yet on OSX to verify).
Unfortunately there seems to be major issues with dakcarto's nightly
builds which are causing additional failures - I'm going to chase this
up with Larry and see if he can fix the build environment to clear
these up. The unfortunate thing is that the OSX tests DID correctly
flag the regression addressed in cc13c57, but the failure was buried
in the noise of other failing tests.

Lastly.... Windows. We're getting stacks of failures on the nightly
Windows builds. I think there's two reasons for this:
1. A valid issue regarding font style names on Windows. Basically, the
test suite relies on a reference font "QGIS Vera Sans Roman". It looks
like there's an issue with font style names in Windows, where "Roman"
is incorrectly shown as "Normal", "Oblique" as "Italic", etc. You can
see this even with standard Windows fonts like Calibri - under Windows
all the style names are wrong, but they're fine under other platforms.
This potentially breaks compatibility of project files between Windows
and other platforms, and also causes all tests which rely on a font to
fail. I *think* this is an upstream issue - from my testing it looks
like we aren't the only Qt app affected by it.

2. Locale issues with the test suite. The Windows builds are done
using a locale which uses , instead of . for decimal places, and many
tests aren't expecting this. We could blindly force the locale for the
tests, but I'd rather address this so that the test suite can actually
test to see if there's underlying issues with the methods on different
locales.

So there we go:
Linux = all good
OSX = mostly good
Windows = a bunch of real issues to address

All told, I'm happy with the direction the test suite is going and the
shape it's in. When we finally get through this backlog of failing
tests it should be easy to keep an eye on dash and address regressions
as they occur. We'll even be ready when Travis gives us the option of
OSX/Windows automated builds.

How sweet to hear this.
All the best.

That is very good to hear indeed.

In the end I think this just comes with the nature of the business.  We
never had fully bug fix releases however I do think the new release cycle
is better then just waiting, waiting longer just pushing the pain out to
the future.  I think it all comes down to growing pains and getting the
test suite into better shape.  As we grow things will get better and we get
better and handling the issues as they come up.

Regards,
Nathan

Subject: [Qgis-developer] owlib internal or shared?
Message-ID: <559379D2.1080002@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I just noticed (thanks Emmanuel) that we maintain an internal, old copy
of OWSlib in the MetaSearch plugin (now core). Te lib is more up to date
on Deb (which fixes a current bug in MS).
Shouldn't we use the shared lib, as usual?
All the best.

Hi all,
opening the field calc, either from the main toolbar or from the table

close to 100%. Anyone confirms?
All the best.
