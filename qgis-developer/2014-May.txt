Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add appropriate colour ramps to results of analyses
Message-ID: <5361F7A8.80107@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I think Processing (but also other analyses) would look more polished if
they would apply a colour table to the results, when appropriate.
I opened a ticket about this:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10146
Comments welcome.
All thee best.

Hi,

I continue with this crash (report attached), with today's master...

Any hint?


Thanks!

Best regards,

Hello again,

I've been looking at the tests during compilation, and the segmentation fault appears in qgis_zoomtest:

????? Start 43: qgis_shapebursttest
43/92 Test #43: qgis_shapebursttest ..................***Failed??? 2.12 sec
????? Start 44: qgis_zoomtest
44/92 Test #44: qgis_zoomtest ........................***Exception: SegFault 18.12 sec
????? Start 45: qgis_projectionissues
45/92 Test #45: qgis_projectionissues ................?? Passed?? 28.29 sec


Looking at the results of the last few weeks in CDash QGIS, this test failed in all builds on Ubuntu 12.04 32bit (and apparently also in Debian Jessie):

http://dash.orfeo-toolbox.org/testSummary.php?project=8&name=qgis_zoomtest&date=2014-05-01? 


Can there be a problem with this architecture?


Best regards,
Pedro?

Message-ID: <2C5F82DA3EE3E449BD473075F2C290BF9900DABF@NINSRV05.nina.no>

Dear devs,

For the Garmin Custom Map plugin (http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/GarminCustomMap/) I got repeatedly bug reports from Mac users, by email in addition to bug tracer: http://hub.qgis.org/issues/9276.
E.g. on OSX 10.8.5 one user reported:

"This plugin is broken
numpy.core.multiarray failed to import"

Yet import of numpy, is not part of the plugin code itself, so I suspect problems located in some underlying components on Mac (plugin uses e.g. GDALs python API)

I do not know of problems on LINUX or Windows. Unfortunately, I have no Mac available, so I cannot investigate myself. Anyone with Mac experience who is willing to help?

Cheers
Stefan

Hi all,

After talking to some users one concern they raised was it was a bit tricky
to get find how to report a bug or feature.  I was thinking it might be a
good idea to have a report bug/feature on the homepage. It would fit quite
nice between the Download and Support

I am aware that you can just click Get Involved, and scroll to the bottom
but it still feels a bit hidden.

Does anyone else feel that same way?

Regards,
Nathan

I spent a while trying to figure out how to report a bug. Which is good -
it probably keeps down frivolous bug reports...but bad because some
probably give up and it could be something important.

There's an interesting question. Should step one be get on the mailing
list and verify bug? Or will the onerous nature of having to get an
account keep out people who don't want to put in enough effort for a
good bug report?

Trade-offs, but +1 on making it more obvious how to start on the path to
bug reports, I mean issues or maybe tickets...

Thanks,
Alex

Hi,
I saw the discussion you had. I would prefer not to add a report bugs
button on the first page of qgis.org but we could make it more prominent on
get involved.
It's not that long since I added the report a bug section to get involved.
Many users might only remember the old page.
Best wishes
Anita

What is the main objection to having it on the main page?

But if that doesn't feel right then I think we should raise it to the top
of get involved page.

Too many vague or un-researched bug reports. People filing bugs instead
of googling the problem or even reading the manual. Lets just go with
the average user might not understand when the right place is the
mailing or stackexchange vs filing a bug. Those other methods of
communication allow true bugs to filter through. It also allows for the
collection of all relevant evidence to make a bug testable or at least
an attempt at it.

It's a signal to noise issue.

Thanks,
Alex

My main objections to having a "report bugs" button on the main page:

- I think users who are not too familiar with the workings of open
source projects will be alarmed why we think it necessary to add a
"report bugs" button right next to the "download" button. They want
(the illusion? of) bug-free software (even if there is no such thing).
- I want to avoid cluttering of the homepage.
- I also think Randal has a point when he says that some small hurdle
can help keep the number of not-so-helpful bug reports down.

+1 for top of "get involved" page.

Hiya,
What about a link saying "Think you've found a bug?"
That then sends the user to a separate page which gives guidance that 
you want to give the user, AND also a box saying "Paste a short error 
message here"
This is then sent off to google for them.

Regards,
Zoltan

There's a reason some projects choose to call them issues and not bugs
(translations vary). I agree you can put a link on the front page to
info about issues, but I would avoid a comment box - that will get hit
by spam bots and then becomes another places people have to check.

Thanks,
Alex

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS custom widgets library for Qt designer:
	python/cpp availability
Message-ID: <53635A61.8020406@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have been creating a new library for having QGIS custom widgets 
available in Qt Designer, see PR 1325 [0].

I am facing a problem regarding the included file name that is defined 
in the custom widget and used by uic to create the code for it [1].

The problem is that this file won't be the same if the UI will be 
compiled from python or from c++.
For example, QgsMapLayerComboBoxPlugin [2], would need to include 
qgsmaplayercombobox.h [3] for c++ while it waits for qgis.gui for Python.

Does someone has any idea if it would be possible to make the widget 
librabry working for both languages?

The non-optimal solutions I see:
* provide two libraries, one for python and one for c++
* add a setting in cmake to choose to compile custom widgets for C++ or 
for python
* choose one by default and let the user change in source the included file

I think that all of these are non satisfying and removes all the magic 
from this new feature.
If you have any lead, it's more than welcome.

Cheers,

Denis

Sorry for the noise, I just found a solution to redirect the widget 
module to qgis.gui:

sys.modules["qgsfieldexpressionwidget"] = qgis.gui

Hi guys,

+1 for top of "get involved" page

But to avoid the massive reporting bug we can write in the page a
suggestion to the users, they need to ask first in one of the mailing list
(qgis-user, qgis-developer) instead reporting right away the bug.

In this scenario, user ask first in the mailing list, then if the bug is
real they will report the bug.

Regards
Jo?o

It was me who years ago put "Issue Tracker" on the MapServer homepage
beside the Download link.  I think you/we must remember this is about
the new users, about helping them tell developers the problems they are
having; a link to "Github" means absolutely nothing to a new user, and
if it is hidden on some sub-page it is useless to a new user.

(I love QGIS and am just trying to help)

All good.  Never once have we had a problem.  Because the process means
you need to create an account, login, then report issue, it weeds out
any non-serious reports (the "feedback" form idea would be full of those
"non-serious" reports I worry; people who report then you never hear
from them again).

Message-ID: <CADf2q0CeXuuXUsf4AfmX0G8BV4mL2W9oJHUbm+kUFTSCARXC6w@mail.gmail.com>

I followed the instructions here:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/INSTALL

and did the build on a clean ubuntu 12.04 64bit vm. the only thing i
changed from the vanilla build was to enable WITH_ORACLE. make and make
install completed without errors, although i did have to run sudo make
install, otherwise I got an error when it tried to copy oracle libs to the
qt system folder.

When starting the qgis app, I get:

./qgis: error while loading shared libraries: libqgis_core.so.2.3.0: cannot
open shared object file: No such file or directory

Any ideas of how to figure out what went wrong? I'm only doing the custom
build to enable oracle support-

The support still needs access to the Oracle Instant Client library
'libclntsh'.

You can get binaries here:
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html

You'll need at least the Basic Lite and the SDK (for the headers).

If you install to a non-standard location, you will probably also need to
define:

-D OCI_INCLUDE_DIR=<path-to-oracle-client-sdk>/sdk/include
-D OCI_LIBRARY=<path-to>/lib/libclntsh.dylib

Coincidentally, when searching for whether there are pre-built binaries as
deb packages, I came across a similar answer, that I believe you provided,
via Kyngchaos.  :-)

Hi,
 So those options already had the correct paths, so I didn't need to update
them. I have the oracle instant client and sdk libraries installed, and
cmake didn't complain about not finding them. Any other ideas?

Maybe you need to update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH so QGIS or Qt knows of the
custom OCI lib path during runtime?

The qsqlocispatial Qt SQL driver should be installed in Qt's
plugins/sqldrivers/ dir (reason you may have needed sudo). It is the one
linked against the OCI client. Maybe check that it is installed correctly,
and that the OCI lib is linked correctly, using `ldd`?

This all assumes that it is the OCI lib stuff that is not being found in
your error, and not something else.

Maybe some Linux gurus can help further.

Larry

I'm not a Linux guru, but I've had the same problem some days ago. It's
related to that pointed in a previous message (the system doesn't know
where to look for those libraries). I haven't been able to solve it in a
nice way with a fancy, for sure one-liner magic console command but just
installing to /usr instead of /usr/local (I seem to recall that you've to
set properly CMAKE_INSTALL_PATH  when ccmake) did the trick for me.

Would be nice to find the right way, anyway

All the best

Possibly running "sudo ldconfig" may help?

probably not without adding a new file in /etc/ld.so.conf.d/ for example 
qgis.conf containing: /usr/local/lib/

So yes after that update your lib PATH with sudo ldconfig.

Hi all.
While revising a few old tickets (the RM search is still a PITA BTW: any hope to
improve it?), I noticed that the current situation seems rather messy: there 177 are
issues, and I suspect many of them are actually fixed in current version, some are
duplicate. See http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?category_id=37
Before doing much new work on symbology, I'd suggest to first have a look to the
existing issues and clean up the current situation.
All the best, and thanks.

+1

,although not a fun job, I think it for the QGIS project important to
keep a more or less clean/valid issue list. In my opinion current
symbology commiters are very well capable to determine the validity of
those issues.

If in doubt, or need for some testers, I would ask them to point to an
issue and just ask here to do further testing..

Thanks,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Question of GDAL versions
Message-ID: <53674820.7040706@pp1.inet.fi>

Hi all respected gurus,

as most of You probably know GDAL/OGR 1.11.0 was released few days ago.
It includes certain new features of GML handling so that we could use 
our national vector map database here in Finland and everybody knows 
what happens to use of QGIS when there is some data to use.

When will new GDAL/OGR 1.11.0 be used in QGIS ?
- some estimate will be enough
- also basic description of obstacles to use new version if exists

With kind regards,
Kari

Where?   You can build QGIS with GDAL 1.11.  OSGeo4W already has it (although
QGIS 2.2 is still at 1.10).

I can confirm - I have the same problem, on Kubuntu 14.04...

Hi,

I'm very sorry, I didn't check everything. Yes it's in my newest testing 
machine.
Thanks all who have been involved into this, now I can spread rumour 
more widely.

Conventu soluto.

Thanks,
Kari

I've had the same problem and the above worked for me. Except that now I
found that some plugin libraries are missing. During start of QGIS I get
a message "Unable to load GdalTools plugin. The required "osgeo
[python-gdal]" module is missing." and after a Python error "Couldn't
load plugin 'processing' [...]". After QGIS startup in the plugin
manager with GdalTools everything seems to be ok, whereas processing
plugin is marked broken and the reinstall button is disabled. Any
suggestions what to do? Daniel

Hi Daniel,
 I still haven't got my install working, any steps in particular that have
been suggested that you found make it work for you?

I'm not sure if I'm looking in the right place, but if the plugin folder
for qt is supposed to be /usr/lib/qt4 (and i do see a smbolic link to this
location), the plugins folder is actually missing altogether?

Hopefully something here is illuminating-

sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4.qsci made the process plugin working for 
me.

For Gdal plugin, I built GDAL with Python Binding but I guess you should 
install python3-gdal

This is the problem, if you added your correct lib path in 
/etc/ld.so.conf.d/qgis.conf (filename is not important, only the extension is 
important) then run sudo ldconfig your system should find them.

First, run sudo updatedb then wait for a while. Finaly check the location 
with:
locate libqgis_gui.so.2.3.0

It gives you at least two location: your build src and your lib install path. 
Take the second one and put it into /etc/ ld.so.conf.d/qgis.conf, run again 
sudo ldconfig

check again with your ldd command.

Python 3 is not supported by QGIS. Install the Python 2 support packages.

Required third-party Python packages include psycopg2, matplotlib,
pyparsing and qscintilla2 for QGIS at runtime; and, numpy for GDAL (raster
support, I believe).

Larry

Yay! Ok, that did it. So, did I do something wrong? After running updatedb,
locate found the libraries in "/home/chrismarx/apps/lib/" . According to
the build instructions, it suggested to create :

mkdir -p ${HOME}/apps

and build the app into there. Is that where those libraries should have
ended up?

ok I understand :)

Add /home/chrismarx/apps/lib/ in the /etc/ld.so.conf.d/qgis.conf is not 
already done and run sudo ldconfig.

If you already do such command line, well I don't know what's wrong. Last 
idea: do you use redhat or something like this?

Sorry, I think you misunderstood, the previous commands did work. I can
start qgis now! yay! I was asking an additional question  -- whether I did
something wrong in the first place, or is this what you're expected to do
when building qgis?

That's great!

Yes "cmake ." command allows you to setup the location where qgis (bin, and 
lib) will be located. Related to this settings you should adapt it for 
ld.so.conf.d  config file.

For me, I install qgis in /usr/local/ which is the default one, in another 
computer I created other location because I have several release of qgis for 
different task (working, testing and trainings) so I have to adapt each time 
the ld.so.conf.d file :)

Ok, cool. Well, not sure if this is a question for another email thread or
not, but now I can at least start the app, I do get the same errors that
daniel mentioned earlier

"I've had the same problem and the above worked for me. Except that now I
found that some plugin libraries are missing. During start of QGIS I get
a message "Unable to load GdalTools plugin. The required "osgeo
[python-gdal]" module is missing." and after a Python error "Couldn't
load plugin 'processing' [...]". After QGIS startup in the plugin
manager with GdalTools everything seems to be ok, whereas processing
plugin is marked broken and the reinstall button is disabled. Any
suggestions what to do?"

and then i can get into the app. I went to add an oracle vector layer, and
I can successfully connect to the database, and I can see the tables, but
they're all greyed out. I have QGIS running on windows against the exact
same db and everything worked just fine. Is this related?

Note that I have been overhauling the plugin builder on my fork [1]
(subject to review to see if others find my approach palatable). I will
implement Anita's suggestion there too.

As Martin mentioned, getting the class type back is nicer. I tested this
and it works nicely:


----------------

import os

from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui, uic

BASE_CLASS = uic.loadUiType(os.path.join(
    os.path.dirname(__file__), 'results_dialog_base.ui'))[0]


class ResultDialog(QtGui.QDialog, BASE_CLASS):
    """Dialog for showing the results of the plugin creation process."""
    def __init__(self):
        QtGui.QDialog.__init__(self)
        # Set up the user interface from Designer.
        self.setupUi(self)

--------------

The advantage is that you can use Qt multi-inheritance which means less and
cleaner code. More details in the Qt section at [1].

I normally do it this way:

base, widget = uic.loadUiType('myui.ui')

class MyWidget(base, widget):
    def __init__(self, parent=None)
         super(MyWidget, self).__init__(parent)

According to the docs[1] you get the concrete class first, then the base
class in the returned tuple:

PyQt4.uic.loadUiType(*uifile*[, *from_imports=False*[,
*resource_suffix='_rc'*]])<http://pyqt.sourceforge.net/Docs/PyQt4/designer.html#PyQt4.uic.loadUiType>

Load a Qt Designer .ui file and return a tuple of the generated *form
class* and
the *Qt base class*. These can then be used to create any number of
instances of the user interface without having to parse the .ui file more
than once.

Message-ID: <OFFC558FED.FF003FE3-ONC1257CD0.003505AB-C1257CD0.0035360F@gfi-dom.local>

Hello,

 I know, its a worst with the c++-plugin-developers...
Again I have a problem with a plugin in updating. 
In QGIS 2.0 (32bit) I have two plugins working. Now I downloaded the 
sources for QGIS 2.2, compiled it and was very happy, because i've had no 
problems here. I compiled my two plugins and get also no errors. The first 
plugin works fine in QGIS 2.2 (32 bit) but the other gets an error 
(written i protocol-extensions) while starting QGIS and loading the 
plugins. But the errormessage is not so meaningful : "The procedure is 
unknown", but which is meant? Besides I could not debug this. Until now i 
debugged my projects when qgis has been started by detaching the process 
in Visual Studio. How can I get the Name of the procedure? I think I'm 
searching the needle in a haystack.
Has anyone an Idea?

Thanks a lot.

SSchmidt

I first installed psycopg2, matplotlib, pyparsing, qscintilla2
and numpy, which did not solve the problem. Then I installed
python3-pyqt4.qsci, which also didn't solve it. Any further ideas? Daniel

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GetLegendGraphic in QGIS Server with no text
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw0LenUYHtS3O3rtbNKG2EwNo_rWk=v23xQAtxtLoKGzuA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am playing with Qgis Web Client in order to put all the legend images in
the layer list.
It seems that QGIS server doesn't render a legend image without text, see
this image:

 http://postimg.org/image/gks0t6j0n/

If I pass the LAYERFONTSIZE or ITEMFONTSIZE with 0 as value, the text label
would not be rendered into the image.

It would be a great addition into Qgis web client!

Message-ID: <OF1C191AB4.72FAD169-ONC1257CD0.004C424A-C1257CD0.004C4AFC@gfi-dom.local>

I've made some progress:
In my working plugin I placed this two lines:

QLibrary myLib( "C:/Progra~2/QGISVA~1/apps/qgis/plugins/tb4qgisplugin.dll" 
);
  bool loaded = myLib.load();

and get this messages:

"qgis-bin.exe": "C:\Program Files (x86)\QGIS 
Valmiera\apps\qgis\plugins\tb4qgisplugin.dll" geladen, Symbole wurden 
geladen.
Eine Ausnahme (erste Chance) bei 0x77c81d82 in qgis-bin.exe: 0xC0000139: 
Entry Point Not Found.
"qgis-bin.exe": "C:\Program Files (x86)\QGIS 
Valmiera\apps\qgis\plugins\tb4qgisplugin.dll" entladen.

But which is the entry point of my dll?

is it the run() of my plugin? I didn't changed the code, what could have 
happened?

[Qgis-developer] couldn't load cpp-plugin







Hello, 

 I know, its a worst with the c++-plugin-developers... 
Again I have a problem with a plugin in updating. 
In QGIS 2.0 (32bit) I have two plugins working. Now I downloaded the 
sources for QGIS 2.2, compiled it and was very happy, because i've had no 
problems here. I compiled my two plugins and get also no errors. The first 
plugin works fine in QGIS 2.2 (32 bit) but the other gets an error 
(written i protocol-extensions) while starting QGIS and loading the 
plugins. But the errormessage is not so meaningful : "The procedure is 
unknown", but which is meant? Besides I could not debug this. Until now i 
debugged my projects when qgis has been started by detaching the process 
in Visual Studio. How can I get the Name of the procedure? I think I'm 
searching the needle in a haystack. 
Has anyone an Idea? 

Thanks a lot.

Hello Rene?,

   Did this fix get in as a patch?  If so, where can I get it for 2.2?

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] ItemDelegate with a tool button: can't click
Message-ID: <5369D4D0.9090401@gmail.com>

Hi all,

Nyall is using the new QgsFieldExpressionWidget as an item delegate and 
there's a problem with clicking on the button.

Indeed, pressing on the button (to open the expression dialog) works 
only and only if the combo box has the focus.

For a demo, see http://youtu.be/o5AgjC4cCqY

Do you have any idea how to handle this?

Thanks a lot,

Denis

It should already be in the official Debian package, build from 2.2 branch.
All the best, and thanks.

It's QGIS-PSC official release ?
What about Mac OSX, Windows, Ubuntu users ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] One to many relations: forms
Message-ID: <5369E7C4.102@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
I'm working with forms and one to many relations, and I do not know whether I hit a
current limitation, or if I'm missing something.
I have custom forms (D&D designer) for both parent and child tables. I want to add
the custom child form to the parent one, so the user can insert new data in the
parent table, and add data to the child from the same form. I cannot find a way to do
it with D&D forms.
With autogenerated forms, this is possible, but:
* the FK, added by hand to the parent, is not shown on the list of the available ones
for child (so the list is taken from the saved table)
* in the tab showing the parent form, also the child table is shown (twice in my case).
I find this rather confusing. It seems to me that the function is geared for adding
children to existing parents, rather than adding parents and children in one shot: am
I wrong? I think also the second case is quite useful in many contexts.
Thanks for any suggestion.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Ticket opening
Message-ID: <5369EA15.7050900@gmail.com>

Hello,

are there any directives out there about what to attach to a ticket?

I'm going to file one or two relative to globe plugin and I want to know 
what information (debug outputs, etc) would be useful for the developers 
prior to file it,

Don't know if there is already any document relative to this. Any 
directions would be much appreciated. Also I would like to suggest the 
creation of a guide to perform this, for those who are willing to help 
but not very skilly.

Best regards,

Jorge Tornero

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing (Saga) help files
Message-ID: <5369F564.50406@gmail.com>

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Hi all,
thanks to the last update of Processing, help files for some Saga
algorithms are available through the Help Tab.

If you want to contribute writing some help, the procedure is very
straightforward. You just need to go here

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/tree/master/python/plugins/processing/algs/saga/help


choose the algorithm, click on `edit` and fill the fields.
Once you have done, click on the green button `Propose file change`,
and that's it.

Thanks to all!

p.s. Victor, if you want to give more explanations please do it!

Matteo

Are we able to change that wording to "Report bugs or features"?

"Reporting a feature" sounds odd. What about sticking to "issues" as a 
more general term?

How about "file a feature request or a bug report".

If it was for me I would prefer "file a feature request or report an 
issue". I think "bug" sounds more severe than "issue" and we want 
people to also report e.g. usability issues.

Even more I would prefer a shorter, more catchy phrase. But I just 
can't think of that one.

i set the "wrap on character" as letter 'L', when the label of a feature is
"AUSTRALIA",
the label change to "AUSTRA"  && "IA",
i wonder know if it is viewed should like this, or it is missed a letter
"L" in the multilines label?

Yes, the 'L' is removed when using multiline labels, if that is the
character set to wrap on.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GDAL 1.11 new formats
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_dLEGcqSLX844WovnubzCYBwbDtu5OHokpMEiYc__2cA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

GDAL/OGR 1.11 offers several new OGR formats [0] that need support added in
QGIS's source. I have added the OpenFileGDB format (because it was simple
to do) [1], but don't have enough experience with the other database
formats to add their support.

* CartoDB : read/write support
* GME (Google Map Engine) : read/write support
* GPKG (GeoPackage): read-write support (vector part of the spec.)
* SXF: read-only support
* WALK : read-only support
* WAsP .map : read-write support

Would anyone be willing to help add support for those? Looks like in
addition to qgsogrprovider.cpp's createFilters( QString type ) that
QgsVectorFileWriter::initMetaData() also needs updated.

IMO, it would be good to then backport these to release-2.2 branch as well,
so current users may benefit from the new formats. I could add my commit,
but seems like it would be better to add full GDAL/OGR 1.11 support at once
to that branch, excepting some formats if they will need more extensive
support added first.

[1] https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/a096cf4

Regards,

Larry

Vincent Mora will be able to help adding in QGIS the necessary parts (if any) 
for the WAsP support, as he is the author of the GDAL driver.
Ping him to coordinate the effort.

There is also one new raster format (KRO).

To whoever adds support for these, it would be nice to test that they it
works in file open dialogs as well as the browser dock and app.  Should
work automatically once the ogr and gdal drivers are updated.

Looks like there is no support for  network-based gdal/ogr drivers in the
browser -  that would be nice to have. It could take the form of a new
top-level item, and a "New connection" dialog similar to the one used in
the "new vector" database widget.

Should this be treated more like SQLite, or Spatialite, instead of CSV?

The Norwegian SOSI format (Vector) is also ?new? - or more precise improved - in terms of build process in GDAL 1.11.

On windows, it is now supported as a GDAL plugin and available in OSGeo4W. On Linux / Mac it still has to be built from source with an external library dependency (https://github.com/kartverket/fyba).
SOSI is a bit peculiar, but it is the format of the official map data in Norway, used by public authorities.  The driver says it is Read/Write but writing is not fully implemented (yet).

It would be splendid to be able to open SOSI files directly in QGIS (see also http://hub.qgis.org/issues/3708) and also write it once the public mapping authority fully implements the driver?

Cheers
Stefan

As far as I understand the code, from QGIS perspective, that's pretty much the 
same thing. Even if .gpkg is technically closer to sqlite/spatialite. But in 
any case you have to check with http://gdal.org/ogr/drv_geopackage.html what 
dataset and layer creation options are available.

FYI, I'm currently working on a GDAL RFC that should make all that knowledge 
of OGR drivers metadata to go from QGIS back to GDAL.

Hello Stefan,

That is very interesting.  Are all of your notes included on the GDAL
Buildhints page, for Windows and Linux/Mac?

The code is only there to formalize the layer and dataset options and 
is currently only used to create GUI elements in the save-as dialog.
Werner Macho has translated all the information from the OGR docs into 
this format.

Yes, though I have to admit that I have no experience with building GDAL with SOSI support on Mac, but I know that the underling OpenFYBA lib has been successfully build on Mac, so I assume the Unix build hints should apply for Mac also  for GDAL/OGR.

Probably I should note, that the free map data of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (http://data.kartverket.no/download/) also come in SOSI format (vector)... 

Cheers
Stefan

That is very interesting.  Are all of your notes included on the GDAL Buildhints page, for Windows and Linux/Mac?

Merci Evan, very interesting indeed. I guess this will imply a significant amount of
work from the QGIS side. This could be the right time to do the final cleanup we have
been talking about several times, removing all the different "Add..." buttons, and
unifying the interface (perhaps using only the Browser).
All the best.

I second Stefan's comments. Having direct SOSI support will really strengthen the position of QGIS here in Norway.

We do a lot of work with SOSI, and it would be great to open (and eventually edit) SOSI files directly rather than having to convert them first.

Emne: Re: [Qgis-developer] GDAL 1.11 new formats

Yes, though I have to admit that I have no experience with building GDAL with SOSI support on Mac, but I know that the underling OpenFYBA lib has been successfully build on Mac, so I assume the Unix build hints should apply for Mac also  for GDAL/OGR.

Probably I should note, that the free map data of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (http://data.kartverket.no/download/) also come in SOSI format (vector)... 

Cheers
Stefan

Hi Gino,

Thanks for your interest, I got a reply on stackoverflow.
One told me to use setFocusProxy(mCombo); and this works well!

Anyway, I thought first of using mouse press event filtering, but I 
wasn't sure how to deal with it.

Cheers,

Denis

Maybe dircetly on the HP http://plugins.qgis.org/ ?
All the best.

Hi Paolo,

There is a "How to add plugins to this repository" title in the "about
plugins" page. I realized that this includes some of those notes you added
at the previous post. May be we can extend these items.

It depends on how much you want to use the new capababilities. A first step 
would be to remove all the metadata about OGR drivers that have been added to 
the QGIS code base (extensions, creation options) to use the equivalent new 
metadata capabilities of OGR drivers, that would also include open options.
A further step would be to handle mixed raster&vector data containers as a 
single dataset.

Hello,

I'm reposting this mail, because I didn't get any answer.
If any additional information is needed please ask me.

I'm writing a plugin for QGIS 2.2.0 which should render a pdf file with 
a map and some text.

The code is working under Linux (current Arch) and Windows XP, but it's not 
working on Windows 7 or 8. Output PDF on Win 7/8 has all labels, but no map, only blank space.

I don't know if it's relevant, but I want to render only raster layers.

The plugin is to be runned from QGIS, so it has access to self.iface 
variable, but I can also use standalone QgsMapRenderer.

What am I missing?
Please help me! ;)

Here is the code I use:

mapRenderer = self.iface.mapCanvas().mapRenderer()
mapRenderer.setLayerSet(input_map_layers) #list of map layers id's
mapRenderer.setOutputUnits(QgsMapRenderer.Millimeters)
mapRenderer.setOutputSize(QSize(map_width_on_print_mm, 
map_height_on_print_mm), 300)
mapRenderer.setExtent(rect)

c = QgsComposition(mapRenderer)
c.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)
c.setPaperSize(210,297)

composerMap = QgsComposerMap(c, 
14.7026,113.85,map_width_on_print_mm,map_height_on_print_mm)
composerMap.setFrameEnabled(True)
composerMap.setFrameOutlineWidth(0.5)
c.addItem(composerMap)

printer = QPrinter()
printer.setOutputFormat(QPrinter.PdfFormat)
printer.setOutputFileName(unicode(input_data_fields['output_pdf_filename']))
printer.setPaperSize(QSizeF(c.paperWidth(), c.paperHeight()), 
QPrinter.Millimeter)
printer.setFullPage(True)
printer.setColorMode(QPrinter.Color)
printer.setResolution(c.printResolution())

pdfPainter = QPainter(printer)
paperRectMM = printer.pageRect(QPrinter.Millimeter)
paperRectPixel = printer.pageRect(QPrinter.DevicePixel)
c.render(pdfPainter, paperRectPixel, paperRectMM)
pdfPainter.end()

What if you try explicitly setting composerMap's extent here? ie,
composerMap.setNewExtent(rect)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Redmine Issues
Message-ID: <1399561987037-5139271.post@n6.nabble.com>

I would like to suggest that maybe developers could take a look at the list
of issues and check them to see which ones are still valid, I have seen a
few that could be closed or are no longer valid like issues with previous
versions of QGIS some very old as 1.6. This would clean the list a lot

Also there are a lot of feature requests and its very difficult to tackle
them all specially with limited time and budget maybe it would be better to
separate bugs from feature requests in redmine leaving just the bugs and for
feature requests use something similar to
http://leaflet.uservoice.com/forums/150880-ideas-and-suggestions-for-leaflet

This way we can get a feel of what feature request are really needed/popular
and which are specific use cases that could wait a while

Hi All

I have done a bit of an overhaul of Gary's awesome plugin builder. There is
a little screencast showing a little of what I have done here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DiwQ0SJYzJ8&feature=youtu.be

I invite you to try it out, send me pull requests to my fork, and give
comments and suggestions via my pull request:

https://github.com/g-sherman/Qgis-Plugin-Builder/pull/11

Despite what is said in the video, Gary is proposing to make it replace the
existing plugin builder rather than sit side by side with V2.

Thanks

Tim

Cool, thanks.
Should we recommend this for new plugin devs?
Perhaps adding the recommendation to plugins.qgis.org?

 out of sync with actual syntax?
Message-ID: <1399584159638-5139316.post@n6.nabble.com>

I found a few places where the syntax of the API documentation says something
and the application telling another story.
One of these inconsistencies happens to be the on geometry query to find the
closest vertex, 
 QgsGeometry.closestVertex (const QgsPoint &point, int &atVertex, int
&beforeVertex, int &afterVertex, double &sqrDist)

The new syntax is  QgsGeometry.closestVertex (const QgsPoint &point) and
returns a list with the rest of the other details. It is quite possible that
C++ is like this one and Python is different. I remember the C++ version was
as given in the docs. But I have not used the new version C++ recently and
am wondering if you guys have noticed differences.

I also think there are other places where changes are not reflected in the
docs. I am willing to help update if no one is able to get to it.

Thank you, 

Maaza

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Thoughts on newly added "min-max map unit scale"
	feature
Message-ID: <CAB28AshmFZnOd_HY3uTPQfwd8dEnxcV7zoonMunksPVVxX1jDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been playing with the newly added "min-max map unit scale"
feature. While this is a great feature to have, I think in it's
current form it's rather confusing for users.

Currently, when clicking the little settings icon next to a size in
map units, a dialog with "maximum scale" and "minimum scale" appears.
It's not immediately obvious as to what these settings actually do -
do they prevent the style showing outside these scale ranges? does the
symbol size reset to some default value outside these ranges? or is
the size clamped to the size it would take at these max/min scale
ranges? It took a bit of experimenting for me to work out that this
last behavior is what occurs.

I think it would make a lot more sense if these max/min sizes were
instead given in "mm", and the labels renamed to "Maximum size" /
"Minimum size". To me this is much more intuitive - it would be
immediately obvious that the size is set in map units, but limited so
that it never become larger or smaller than these set size limits.

This would take this feature from being an advanced feature which
takes a lot of experimenting to tweak correctly to something I'd use
on a regular basis!

What's everyone else's thoughts on this?

+1 - I think this approach will make it much more intuitive.

Since composer supports multiple pages, wouldn't those keybindings make
better sense for navigating composer pages? It may be worth looking what
other apps use so we can follow suite.

That's exactly how the current shortcuts were chosen. I'm not too keen to
change them for this very reason... I'd prefer to keep them more or less in
line with other DTP standard shortcuts.

Thanks, I've added your line to the code.

At the beggining nothing has changed, but I've opened a few different
projects to test and for some (2) of them rendering the map worked, but for
most of tested (5) not.

I've also commented the line you've provided and nothing changes (still
those 2 works, but majority not).

On Linux still everything works.

I guess maybe it's something with image caching?

Cheers, Przemys?aw Gierski.

I've tried to compare these project on which rendering works to these on which it doesn't.

They have the same tiff raster format, they have different raster layers number, but I've deleted excessive layers and in PDF I only have blank space instead of a map.

Also when rendering is not working, the output PDF has a lot smaller size and renders / opens instantly. I don't know in what format the image in PDF is stored, but it looks like it's just not rendered at all.

Any ideas?

Hi,

I'm starting to approach a bug fix about a blocker (for me) bug (
https://hub.qgis.org/issues/10216)... I compiled tests to check if my
modification could break something

naturally I checked test before my patch and I find

80% tests passed, 18 tests failed out of 92

Total Test time (real) = 271.32 sec

The following tests FAILED:
  4 - qgis_diagramtest (Failed)
  5 - qgis_diagramexpressiontest (Failed)
 16 - qgis_maprenderertest (Failed)
 27 - qgis_composermaptest (Failed)

 87 - PyQgsPalLabelingServer (Failed)
 89 - PyQgsSpatialiteProvider (Failed)

most of them related to composer so probably will not be affected by my
rovider patch

this mail only to suggest to maintain tests too otherwise patching will be
more difficult

thank you, Luigi Pirelli

Hi,

I've been hoping have some place where to write notes of xxx 
language/national remarks of each document. These notes could e.g.. 
explain how translation is done, which is the planned time schedule etc. 
This way the notes/remarks will follow also to all versions of that 
document.

Could we add to each manual/guide a dummy chapter (e.g.. "Language based 
notes" or "National remarks") with e.g.. 3 strings for that purpose ?

Best regards,
Kari

I would add that the units be configurable, instead of only one unit. In the
this part of the world, we use imperial units and everyone seems to embrace
the King and Queen Units with no King and Queens in residence.

Oh, I forgot, we have stars and idols to keep us amused.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Spatial Index (QGIS Pyhton) is holey ,
	holly or slippery?
Message-ID: <1399691872691-5139514.post@n6.nabble.com>

I am not sure if there is a hole in the spatial index or a slippery slope
leading it to a wrong conclusion. I am having a problem with the Spatial
Index not finding the geometry very close to it and going and finding other
geometry much farther away. It is not very nice! 

What do you think may be the reason for the very holey spatial network
indexing I am encountering. I have a route network that is the source for
the spatial index, and I select a point on a given route by using a point
closest to the geometry I would like to access on a route. The index returns
a completely different route(s) out of the way from the closest one and it
does not even report the nearest one. 

This is making me feel foolish. I am using 2.2 version and using Python. I
have used it in C++ and it worked well before. As I mentioned in the
previous post, using Python I find python syntax documented on the 2.0 or
2.2 version of the API to be somewhat different than the code. The nearest
neighbor for the spatial index is out of sync with the QGIS API python docs
and I am not sure if it is the same for C++ (I have compiled on 2.0 and I
have had no problems.)

Ok, problem solved.

Your hint with the extent setting put me on a right track.

It turns out that I had a total mess with coordinate reference systems beetween layers and projects. QGIS was reprojecting everything on the fly, but I had to double check everything to get it right in the end.

So after all there is no problem with rendering on Win 7/8, it was just my problems with coordinates.

To solve the issue I had to check every time which crs I have in one layer and convert the extent to destination crs (used in map canvas).

This code does the trick:

map_centroid_point_layer_crs = desired_layer.crs()
destination_crs = mapRenderer.destinationCrs()
xform = QgsCoordinateTransform(map_centroid_point_layer_crs, destination_crs)
map_centroid_point_in_dest_crs = xform.transform(map_centroid_point)

# here is the code for calculating the extent
map_width_on_print_mm = 182
map_height_on_print_mm = 160

map_x_min = map_x - (((map_width_on_print_mm * scale) / 1000.0) / 2.0)
map_x_max = map_x + (((map_width_on_print_mm * scale) / 1000.0) / 2.0)

Hello all,

Is the SQL Anywhere plugin still working in QGIS 2.2? Or it was replaced by
DB Manager? Because we still mention it on Users Manual. Should it be
removed?

Thanks,

It should be working in 2.2 but personally I have never tried it.

It is however very likely that it will be removed from 2.4:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Advanced digitize toolbar on first install
Message-ID: <53705F5C.5050404@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have noticed that on a fresh install of QGIS, the "advanced digitize 
toolbar" is hidden, or maybe is empty, although it is marked as seen in 
the customization.

Hence, to show it for the first time, one has to:
1. uncheck it in the customization dialog
2. close/reopen QGIS
3. re-check it
3. close/reopen QGIS.

I would say that for a first time user, it might be quite hard to find 
out...

Does someone knows how to fix this?

Cheers,

Denis

I already had a look at those script. The idea is very good, but the
implementation is not ideal for an example.For instance, it uses message
dialogs, something that should't be used Instead, exceptions should be
raised and Processing will take care of that, and that will allow to use
the algoritm correctly in the modeler.

So the answer is yes, but I would like to polish the code before adding t
as an example that others might follow.

I don't like the fact that customization needs restart when it is to
show/hide tools, other software don't need to restart so I am wondering if
it is actually possible to QGIS to customize toolbars without having to
restart

+1, would there be a way to show all supported files as an option? That would
work to show all supported by default files without showing extra files like
all files (*) would do, All files still would be an option

All files (*)
All supported files ()

Oh sorry, I wasn't talking about changing them by default but having the
option to do it like I can with in Canvas Configure Shortcuts, I thought it
was possible.

BTW currently one can't navigate composer pages using Page Up or Page Down,
should this be added?

What are your opinions about splitting this into different tabs? Are 
you ok with the three proposed tabs or do you have alternative ideas?

Hi Nyall

The use-case behind that function was to stop the symbols getting too 
big at some point if zooming in. Now if there is a complex symbol with 
several symbol layers and a lot of properties, you may just set minimum 
/ maximum scale on symbol level.

In case min/max size in mm has to be given, you need to set that for 
each property of each symbol layer again. Because each property is 
likely to be different in size  (e.g. line width, marker line distance, 
marker line marker size, marker line marker outline width, pattern 
distance, .....). The notation with the scale is more generic and can 
cover everything in one go.

I wonder if it would just be enough to set more descriptive 
labels/tooltips to the min/max scale dialog?

Regards,
Marco

It can be done but requires a really long filter string (with all possible
file extensions) shown in the dialog - not very practical. See attached
screenshot which occupies the whole screen.

To do this properly (without showing the long filter string) would require
a custom widget, I think.

Oh I thought you didn't need to list all the extensions, yeah that seems impractical. I thought you could add the extensions in the background and just show All supported files in the dialog box

Yes, I think different tabs could help clear things up.

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_Ecu=yiriJcD5R_4BXQ0MVk2Gn2nRQiXeY_hwFRfH_Gfw@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to update the Users Manual Screenshot for form annotations.

In my case, QGIS is crashing when I try to use a form. Can anyone please
check if it's working or if there is something wrong with my form [0]?

Also, there is a broken link [1] in the Users Manual in this section that
would explain how to crate a form to use with form annotation. Can we
ressuscitate the link? I used Tim Sutton video to create my form.

Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] MetaSearch core integration questions
Message-ID: <CAFWXLWWnk2c9UiX2JOQR-_2RNKvQWPjFbcs_hKEW5RZJLH7JYg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all: FYI MetaSearch [0] has been approved for inclusion in QGIS
core [1] [2].  I've started to work on the integration.  I originally
envisioned an automagic process using git merge/read-tree, however
given the issues below, I am finally realizing that a canned release
brute force dump might be the best thing as a first step.

My plan is to create a build process which exports a stable MetaSearch
for QGIS release.

The following issues exist:

- handling dependencies: MetaSearch requires OWSLib, pygments, and
Jinja2 [3] (and everything upstream of them that is not in the Python
standard library) and integrates these via pip.  For publishing to
plugins.qgis.org we bundle them into the .zip package into a dir call
ext-libs.  We can do the same for QGIS inclusion for now.  What is the
state of affairs in terms of QGIS build workflow / core support for
Python dependencies?  This would really move forward the Python plugin
(core Python plugins or installed via plugins.qgis.org) ecosystem
knowing that a few core Python libs are in core

- cmake: MetaSearch does build type things via Paver.  I've added
various CMakeLists.txt files in the code (not pushed yet), however if
I include the dependencies (see point above), does this mean I need to
add CMakeLists.txt files across the dependency directory structure
(for example, see current MetaSearch download at [4])?!

I hope the above is somewhat clear.  Admittedly I am new to the QGIS
build story and have only used cmake in my MapServer dev.  Thanks for
the help so far in irc.

..Tom

Hi Andrea,

I did not mean to use CSS files, just be able to use the style property of
HTML tags, such as :

<span style="font-weight:bold;color:blue;">[% "column_a" %]</span>

like we are already able to do in the "Display" tab of the vector layer
properties dialog. This way we could use HTML syntax to style labels. It
won't be easy to implement though because it will overlap features proposed
by expressions for the label configuration options.

NB: I added qgis-dev to the list for gathering feedbacks on this.

Michael

Message-ID: <53720B60.4090104@faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Just opened a few tickets about it.
I think with a little bit of smoothing, this function will be much more
usable.
I also ound some dialog formatting issues on smaller screens (parent
table occupying too much space, window not resizing, etc.), but I think
this has been fixed in master.

All the best.

Hi all.
I'm working with forms and one to many relations, and I do not know
whether I hit a
current limitation, or if I'm missing something.
I have custom forms (D&D designer) for both parent and child tables. I
want to add
the custom child form to the parent one, so the user can insert new data
in the
parent table, and add data to the child from the same form. I cannot
find a way to do
it with D&D forms.
With autogenerated forms, this is possible, but:
* the FK, added by hand to the parent, is not shown on the list of the
available ones
for child (so the list is taken from the saved table)
* in the tab showing the parent form, also the child table is shown
(twice in my case).
I find this rather confusing. It seems to me that the function is geared
for adding
children to existing parents, rather than adding parents and children in
one shot: am
I wrong? I think also the second case is quite useful in many contexts.
Thanks for any suggestion.
All the best.

I guess this plugin might also break Google TOS:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/go2streetview/


See:
https://developers.google.com/maps/terms


(g) *No Use of Content without a Google Map.* You must not use or display
the Content without a corresponding Google map, unless you are explicitly
permitted to do so in the Maps APIs Documentation, or through written
permission from Google. In any event, you must not use or display the
Content on or in conjunction with a non-Google map. For example, you must
not use geocodes obtained through the Service in conjunction with a
non-Google map. As another example, you must not display Street View
imagery alongside a non-Google map, but you may display Street View imagery
without a corresponding Google map because the Maps APIs Documentation
explicitly permits you to do so.

If is it user responsibility to enter webservices addresses and hit rate,
then I wouldn't care.

Even a simple "wget" command can be used against many TOS, IMHO it's end
user's responsibility to check TOS and use the tolls accordingly.

I added an extension filter for SOSI to QGIS master [0].

Also, for Mac, I added Homebrew formulae for the OpenFYBA lib (fyba) [1]
and a GDAL/OGR shared plugin (gdal-sosi) [2]. The SOSI support was recently
added to the base GDAL formula (gdal) [3], so recompiling it after
installation of fyba will also work, e.g.:

$ brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
$ brew update

Then...

$ brew upgrade gdal   <-- this will install 1.11.0 'bottle,' if not already
done
$ brew install fyba
$ brew install gdal-sosi  <-- installs ogr_SOSI.dylib plugin in
HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib/gdalplugins/

Or...

$ brew install fyba
$ brew reinstall gdal --build-from-source --enable-unsupported

QGIS built against GDAL/OGR 1.11 with the sample .sos file loaded [4].

Please submit any issues with fyba or gdal-sosi formulae to OSGeo4Mac
tracker [5].

I second Stefan's comments. Having direct SOSI support will really strengthen the position of QGIS here in Norway.

We do a lot of work with SOSI, and it would be great to open (and eventually edit) SOSI files directly rather than having to convert them first.

I added an extension filter for SOSI to QGIS master [0].

Also, for Mac, I added Homebrew formulae for the OpenFYBA lib (fyba) [1] and a GDAL/OGR shared plugin (gdal-sosi) [2]. The SOSI support was recently added to the base GDAL formula (gdal) [3], so recompiling it after installation of fyba will also work, e.g.:
$ brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
$ brew update
Then...

$ brew upgrade gdal   <-- this will install 1.11.0 'bottle,' if not already done
$ brew install fyba
$ brew install gdal-sosi  <-- installs ogr_SOSI.dylib plugin in HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib/gdalplugins/

Or...
$ brew install fyba
$ brew reinstall gdal --build-from-source --enable-unsupported
QGIS built against GDAL/OGR 1.11 with the sample .sos file loaded [4].
Please submit any issues with fyba or gdal-sosi formulae to OSGeo4Mac tracker [5].

Emne: Re: [Qgis-developer] GDAL 1.11 new formats

Yes, though I have to admit that I have no experience with building GDAL with SOSI support on Mac, but I know that the underling OpenFYBA lib has been successfully build on Mac, so I assume the Unix build hints should apply for Mac also  for GDAL/OGR.

Probably I should note, that the free map data of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (http://data.kartverket.no/download/) also come in SOSI format (vector)...

I know this is a long standing issue. The current suggestion (adding $rownum) is

Even worse: if you have a db layer, with credentials, then you remove it for
distributing your project without sending out your credentials, these are in fact
kept in.

This is a bump, I think my last message got rejected because of a
screenshot I included. So both Daniel and I appear to still have the same
problem, after building qgis from source, it starts up, but with the
following errors:

"Except that now I
found that some plugin libraries are missing. During start of QGIS I get
a message "Unable to load GdalTools plugin. The required "osgeo
[python-gdal]" module is missing." and after a Python error "Couldn't
load plugin 'processing' [...]". After QGIS startup in the plugin
manager with GdalTools everything seems to be ok, whereas processing
plugin is marked broken and the reinstall button is disabled. Any
suggestions what to do?"

I'm hoping that this problem is also the reason that while I can bring up
the add oracle vector layer dialog, I can't select any of the tables to
actually import.
Thanks,
Chris-

There is a problem in G_fatal_error():

    static int busy
    if (busy)
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    busy = 1;

second G_fatal_error() call always exits.

The busy check is there for the case when print error routine itself
ends up with call to G_fatal_error()?

May be the busy variable made global and added a function to clear it?

It seems that those who know are quiet and no one responded to answer my
earlier query as well. Your guess is as good as mine. I think this is the
end of the semester or spring time etc. One has to just try every
possibility and find out on his own, that is what open-source means. No one
is responsible and no one is obligated to answer. 
One may have to look at the C++ code itself, that is, if the code itself is
really current and on which version of the code one is working on. 
That is a long winded and the uninitiated version of the answer. May be the
initiated would step in and help all of us.

You're right, that method should be update in the cookbook.
It was the way ellipsoidal mode was set until QGIS 1.8 [1], but
setEllipsoidalMode
is the new naming since 2.0 [2]

Hi Arnaud,

Thanks for your answer, it works fine but only with Python plugins. I can
get the list of available plugin with:
`qgis.utils.available_plugins`

In my case, I'd like to enable / disable plugin like Grass or Road graph.

Any hint?

Merci.

Hi Nyall,

Good question :)
I would say : we have to ensure that the new API does not break
compilation of a code designed with the previous API.
And since calling a function returning bool and ignoring its returned
parameter is not a compilation error in C++, and it does not neither
break a Python code calling it, I'd see no problem.

Can others confirm ?

Hi all.
The unapproved plugins queue is slowly shortening, and I think even the limited
review we are doing is improving the plugins, and the whole process.
I would now clean up also the remaining 7. In particular, the authors of two of them:
UnzipFile
showGML
are not responding to my repeated emails. Te email address as reported seems ok, but
I cannot be certain.
I would be grateful if someone could contact the authors and ask if they could write
me, or the ML.
Thanks.

Hi all, ol? Alexandre,

Probably you found the bug that Matthias mentioned, which is still 
opened. On my QGIS 2.2, on Ubuntu 12.04 your example crashes QGIS.

But writing a few lines of python, your form loads. So, it might (I 
really don't know!) be a QGIS problem, although it works fine on other 
platforms.

Opening your form with just vanilla python+qt:

import sys
from PyQt4 import QtCore, QtGui, uic
form_class = uic.loadUiType("annotations_form.ui")[0]
class MyWindowClass(QtGui.QMainWindow, form_class):
     def __init__(self, parent=None):
         QtGui.QMainWindow.__init__(self, parent)
         self.setupUi(self)
app = QtGui.QApplication(sys.argv)
myWindow = MyWindowClass(None)
myWindow.show()
app.exec_()

The form opens: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5489125/Dialog_013.png

I hate to say, but for now, it is better to prepare the documentation 
and screen captures on another platform :-(

Regards,

J. Gustavo

Hi Larry,

I tried now with QGIS 2.3 nightly build (2.3.0-81) in OSGeo4W.
When I try to open a SOSI file in QGIS I still get the ?Invalid Source? error message.
The gdal-sosi-plugin package in OSGeo4W is built against GDAL 1.10. Can that be a problem? Will I have to rebuild the plugin against GDAL 1.11 in order to make it accessible for QGIS (ogrinfo --format lists SOSI).
Or is the solution to install OSGeo4W from scratch?

Any other ideas?

Cheers
Stefan

I second Stefan's comments. Having direct SOSI support will really strengthen the position of QGIS here in Norway.

We do a lot of work with SOSI, and it would be great to open (and eventually edit) SOSI files directly rather than having to convert them first.

I added an extension filter for SOSI to QGIS master [0].

Also, for Mac, I added Homebrew formulae for the OpenFYBA lib (fyba) [1] and a GDAL/OGR shared plugin (gdal-sosi) [2]. The SOSI support was recently added to the base GDAL formula (gdal) [3], so recompiling it after installation of fyba will also work, e.g.:
$ brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
$ brew update
Then...

$ brew upgrade gdal   <-- this will install 1.11.0 'bottle,' if not already done
$ brew install fyba
$ brew install gdal-sosi  <-- installs ogr_SOSI.dylib plugin in HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib/gdalplugins/

Or...
$ brew install fyba
$ brew reinstall gdal --build-from-source --enable-unsupported
QGIS built against GDAL/OGR 1.11 with the sample .sos file loaded [4].
Please submit any issues with fyba or gdal-sosi formulae to OSGeo4Mac tracker [5].

Emne: Re: [Qgis-developer] GDAL 1.11 new formats

Yes, though I have to admit that I have no experience with building GDAL with SOSI support on Mac, but I know that the underling OpenFYBA lib has been successfully build on Mac, so I assume the Unix build hints should apply for Mac also  for GDAL/OGR.

Probably I should note, that the free map data of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (http://data.kartverket.no/download/) also come in SOSI format (vector)...

Hello Stefan,

That is very interesting.  Are all of your notes included on the GDAL Buildhints page, for Windows and Linux/Mac?

I am not sure what you mean, Paulo. But there is already the Feature Id
(Object Id in ArcGIS) in QgsFeature. Do you mean having that a mandatory
field that gets populated every time a feature is created within a
shapefile?
I think it is a good idea to have the id field automated in QGIS. But it is
not something that is a priority for me.
Blessings,

Hello all,

It seems to be the same problem. I will look into the bug report and test
it as soon as I.

Happily this screenshot does not depends of the platform. So I can create
it in other SO.

Thanks.

Not sure of the state of this under OSGeo4W, or about the specific changes
to the SOSI driver in 1.11. I would guess the plugin needs to be built
against latest 1.11 stable source to remove that question from the
debugging process.

I am also unsure if the 2.3.0-81 nightly build includes the file filter
commit; though that commit may have nothing to do with QGIS 'supporting'
the format, since it is provided by OGR. Does it list "Systematic
Organization of Spatial Information [SOSI]" in the filter list in the
vector layer open dialog?

Can you share the test data file (if different than the one listed on the
GDAL/OGR wiki)?

Regards,

Larry

I ment some G_fatal_error_recover() which would be called as last thing
from QGIS error routine.

Sounds good.

G_add_error_handler() is used by GRASS itself?

Whatever allows to "recover" from fatal error will help. I would prefer
however not changing semantics too much so that GRASS 6, 7.0.0beta1 and
7.x.x may be easily supported by the same code with only few ifdefs.

I've just been using the new implementation of Geopackage in QGIS :) However each map render or feature info is very slow for large database files - even with the new GDAL/OGR Geopackage spatial index support. Each time QGIS renders a new map view or executes a feature info it re-opens the Geopackage file in QgsOgrFeatureIterator via OGROpen, and the Geopackage driver open method runs PRAGMA integrity_check which is very slow (4 secs with my 2GB test file). This integrity check is actually a Geopackage requirement.

How can this be fixed? At the in QGIS or GDAL/OGR level?

Cheers,
Jeremy

More probably there is some optimal adjust chance, but the geopackage
format is for exchange data. It is sub optimal for work daily.

HI Stefan,

Call from QGIS is here: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrfeatureiterator.cpp#L45

GDAL code is here:

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/gpkg/ogrgeopackagedatasource.cpp#L421

My profiler says all the time is in OGRGeoPackageDataSource::Open.

Also a simple check via the command line for the given database:

qlite3 test_parcels.gpkg
sqlite> .timer ON
sqlite> PRAGMA integrity_check;
ok
CPU Time: user 3.384211 sys 0.756047

Cheers,
Jeremy

Hi Jeremy

Is this PRAGMA integrity_check really the bottle neck?
Is it an integrity check on a data type (e.g. integer - its probably actually an integrity check on SRID)?
Can you point to the code?

Yours, Stefan

Hi Andrea,
gpkg seems to aim at a complete replacement of shp:
http://www.geopackage.org/
not only for data transfer, but for everyday usage.
Do you have more info on this?
All the best.

So it's this code fragment?
419     /* Requirement 6: The SQLite PRAGMA integrity_check SQL command
SHALL return ???ok??? */
420    /* http://opengis.github.io/geopackage/#_file_integrity */
421    if( strncmp(pszFilename, "/vsicurl/", strlen("/vsicurl/")) != 0 &&
422        OGRERR_NONE != PragmaCheck("integrity_check", "ok", 1) )

Looks strange to me why a single file check woold be the bottlenet since
this should be a single call.

I would have expected that some repeated calls (like reading
objects/records and checking SRID or data types) would be the bottleneck
since SQlite is not performant when used with PRAGMA checks. This would be
a check one could disable with a parameter.

Hi Jeremy

Is this PRAGMA integrity_check really the bottle neck?
Is it an integrity check on a data type (e.g. integer - its probably
actually an integrity check on SRID)?
Can you point to the code?

Yours, Stefan

Almost: I mean let the user define a field as SERIAL
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/datatype-numeric.html
also for non-database data types (especially shp).
It does not seem too difficult, now that we have a record number function in the
expressions.
All the best.

I've just noticed that thread. Actually I found that integrity_check was slow 
when operating on remote databases with /vsicurl/ and didn't verify how slow 
it could be with local big files, but its documentation at 
http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check suggests that it 
might be bery slow indeed.
Reading the GeoPackage spec, nothing mandates to do the integrity_check at 
open time. It only mandates that if you run "pragma integrity_check" it should 
retrun OK. So I've disabled the check by default.

Message-ID: <53774BB1.8090307@gmail.com>


I have really difficulty to write of a so complex question in english.
:(
However try to explain.
The shapefile is absolutely a bad solution for interchange usage.
We experiment every day troubles. Sometimes the troubles was discovered 
after many time.
The shapefile born as a simply format for a simply GIS product.
SO the major request was "t be simpler possible".
And infact the shapefile is really simply.
The shp specs use the DBF format, but forgot that of DBF format there 
are many ,sometimes also really distinct to each other.
(read the old clipper dbf spec and the old ashton-tate dbf spec to 
understand what this mean).

So two shapefile could be not compatible at all.
Also the shapefile don't sauy nothing of character-set usage.
This is a bad question because often we must try more than one 
Character-set and hope to have no mixing of CS to retrieve correctly the 
texts.
Also the shapefile don't has a NULL definition and also it allow the 
strange mix of MULTIPART and SIMPLY geometries.

All this and so on are foe for a real interchangeable format because
usually this mean that I export from a remote system , from a distinct 
GIS solution to every other solution.

We every day use the gdal to transform (thx to gdal forever), but gdal 
cannot do miracles.

A format born for interchange is surely the GML.
It allow to define a different SRS for every geometry, also allow to 
host every typeof geometry ,
but the GML failed in the market because the geometric definition was 
not well explained and so every GIS software
choose to do its own interpretation of the geometrical tag in the GML.

Obviously the postgis , oralce and so on are not really nterchange 
formats because they are only dump of the DBMS information.
Another good candidate for interchange was the spatialite.
The lastversion 4.2 is really good.
It host metadata, host styles, host history and convert al to the UTF-8 
internal.
It has some limitation respect to the GML.
The GML allow to have a distinct SRS for every geometry instead the 
spatialite allow a SRS for every table (dataset).

But this limitation will not be a real limit today, perhaps in the next 
2-3 year it will became a limit.

But the spatialite has another limit for a good interchange format.
It is also an elaboration unit.
This is an advantage for me , but not for a real interchange format that 
need only host data.
And give the elaboration phase to the GIS.
This is a philosophy I don't like more, but has its own reasons .

So why the geopackage is not a good work format ?
The response is because it is a interchange format. The need of a work 
frmat are different from that of  a work format.
The first need to but not redundant, more compact, but without loss any 
information or setting and compressable.

The shapefile is nothing.
It is not a good interchange format, and not a good working format.
:)

The spatialite is like a DBMS, it is a good work format.
And has some point of interest in the interchange.
The capability internally to speak with shapefile, postgres, dxf, wfs 
and GML/XML are good options.

Also it hs a good elaboration capability.
Is has no the limit of the shapefile and this is good.
It host the styles and this is good.

But has also some bad points.
It is no so universal diffuse.
Only qgis know it, and the qgis seem to have an own spatialite dialect 
not fully compatible with the original spatialite.
The styles on spatialite are supported from qgis but they are 
incompatible respect at original spatialite version and this is a bad point.
The metadata tables of spatialite are ignored from qgis.
So the spatialite seem to be a chatedral in the desert.

The spatialite will never to be a real interchange format if the only 
software to use it is qgis and the same qgis is not real compatible with 
the original spatialite spec.

So the spatialite actually is a really good and strong work format .

Instead surely geopackage are no one strong point in elaboration so I'm 
not surprise that it is slow.
It don't born to do this work.
:)

Actually I am wondering how different is the format of GeoPackage from
the format of SpatiaLite... we could use our native SpatiaLite
provider also for GeoPackage files if they are close enough. Any
ideas?

Ciao A.

The bottleneck has been identified and Even resolved it.
As Jeremy reported it was the PRAGMA integrity_check which checked the
whole file(!) when opening.
Now it remains to be tested how much faster opening of the GeoPackage is.

Hi Martin

It has a different binary encoding compared to Spatialite.
And in addition it integrates raster tiles (MBTiles) and metadata.

As you will know the GeoPackage SQLite Extension is pending for future
versions of the specification. In case it would make Spatialite/Geopackage

Hi Paolo

+1 for a QGIS Field edittype called "Serial" and implementing
auto-incrementation for non-database formats :

* in the form, make the field visible but not editable
* for new object, get the next number

QGIS could store the current serial state in the project file and update it
during the commit, and manage multiple inserts and errors on insert

Michael

Hi Giovanni.

You have point an interesting question.
The question is:

geopackage and spatialite will be binary compatible (almost in the blob
where there are store the geometry) ?
I guess no because I don't realize how a geopackage spec could support some
different binary formats.

If this is true (i cannot be sure now, hope wrong obviously)
this mean that will be another different format in a sqlite.

The first is spatialite, the second is the porting of qgis to spatialite,
the third is this next coming version of geopackage on spatialite.

A.

The dbf spec has a type serial ?

I don't remenber , but not sure of this.

If the dbf has not a serial type.

This enhance will mena to produce a new kind of shapfile
readable only from QGIS.

I guess should be avoided to produce incompatible new formats.

Andrea.

No, the Geopackage BLOB is different from Spatialite. Have a look to the
paragraph 2.1.3.1.1 in the Geopackage specification.

The Luciad libgpkg has a compatibility mode for Spaltialite 1.x,2.x and
3.x, which *should* guarantee read/write correctness for Spatialite layouts.
Anyway, GDAL has its own implementation, and the gpkg driver is strictly
directed to the Geopackage layout.

Yes, it will be a mess! :)
When you will receive e sqlite DB what of the three forms will it be? Trial
and error, if you don't know it ;)

Thanks for the notes. Issue added:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10295
Anyone interested in implementing or sponsoring it?
All the best.

It does but not in dbf IV which is what shapefiles use (from a little
online poking) only in later versions like dbf 7.

I think what's being proposed is that the QGIS project is the only thing
that tracks that's serial, in the dbf field definition would stay
Integer. Of course editing the file in another program can easily break it.

I'd rather see effort into making other formats 1st class to help move
people off of shapefiles. Note ArcGIS does now support Spatialite
http://blog.geomusings.com/2013/08/07/spatialite-and-arcgis-10-dot-2/
And we expect Geopackage adoption to follow in the next few years.

Course if this really bugs someone, by all means implement something
just don't break the compatibility of the files.

Hi Even,

Thanks for the change! I've now tested the GDAL trunk with QGIS and it's lightning fast with large files - problem solved.

Thanks once again,
Jeremy

I've just noticed that thread. Actually I found that integrity_check was slow
when operating on remote databases with /vsicurl/ and didn't verify how slow
it could be with local big files, but its documentation at
http://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_integrity_check suggests that it
might be bery slow indeed.
Reading the GeoPackage spec, nothing mandates to do the integrity_check at
open time. It only mandates that if you run "pragma integrity_check" it should
retrun OK. So I've disabled the check by default.

I'm wondered why QGIS needs a native SpatiaLite provider and connection dialogue any more. Unlike other database providers such as PostGIS, Oracle, MSSQL the SpatiaLite provider doesn't seem to have anything special that requires a QGIS provider. From a users perspective it just adds to the confusion and complexity for adding data. Why not just use GDAL/OGR for both Geopackage and Spatialite?

Cheers
Jeremy

Hi Martin

It has a different binary encoding compared to Spatialite.
And in addition it integrates raster tiles (MBTiles) and metadata.

This integrity check is actually a Geopackage requirement.

Actually I am wondering how different is the format of GeoPackage from
the format of SpatiaLite... we could use our native SpatiaLite
provider also for GeoPackage files if they are close enough. Any
ideas?

Stefan,

it's indisputably true that's a single call; anyway invoking
this PRAGMA implies an impressively huge workload.
Accordingly to the SQLite's own documentation:

"This pragma does an integrity check of the entire database.
  The integrity_check pragma looks for out-of-order records,
  missing pages, malformed records, and corrupt indices."

Very short said: the sqlite's engine is forced to read and
check the whole db-file from start to end; and accordingly
to this the expected execution time will be approximatively
proportional to the db-file size.

Even,

I've tested a SpatiaLite DB containing about ten million
polygons (3+ GB); and this PRAGMA actually required 15/20
minutes before completing.
this definitely confirms that the execution time increases
proportionally to the db-file size.


> So I've disabled the check by default.

seems to be the only practical option.
executing this "PRAGMA integrity_check" is really justified
only after noticing some puzzling and extraordinary behaviour
leading to the reasonable suspect that some nasty data
corruption possibly affected the db-file.

Jeremy,

I fully agree with you; this seems to be a very nice idea.
and please note: not from an user perspective, but mainly
from a developer/maintainer perspective.

- QGIS mainly uses SpatiaLite as a generic data repository,
   and does very little usage of the many advanced features
   supported by SpatiaLite (Spatial SQL extensions supporting
   full Spatial Analysis, routing facility, direct access
   to external shapefiles, CSV files, DXF files, XLS spreadsheets,
   WFS servers, direct support to ISO Metadata and SLD/SE styles
   and so on).
   basically QGIS simply requires just a bere INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE
   minimal support, and requires an optimized access strategy
   based on Spatial Index when available; no more than this.

- developing and maintaining a specific QGIS/spatialite data
   provider surely was a required step several years ago, when
   spatialite had very limited diffusion; and effectively at the
   time the "with-internal-spatialite" option made easy deploying
   in the most painless way QGIS and SpatiaLite both on Linux
   and Windows.

- anyway, many things have changed during the years; spatialite
   is now widely supported by many mainstream distributions,
   the initial "naive" approach based on internal static
   linkage has revealed in the meanwhile all its intrinsic
   limitations; the scenario is significantly changed since
   then.

- on the other hand it's indisputably true that now GDAL
   effectively supports a first class SpatiaLite driver,
   including full Spatial Index support (the most critical
   feature in the QGIS own perspective).
   from a developer/maintainer perspective updating and
   eventually patching a GDAL/OGR driver is surely simpler
   and easier than updating the corresponding QGIS data
   provider (first because GDAL has no frills connected
   to GUI elements such as dialog boxes and alike, and
   second because GDAL has rock-stable APIs reasonably
   immune form sudden changes).

- all this considered, completely removing the specialized
   QGIS/spatialite data provider so to perform a full switch
   to the GDAL driver could effectively represent a radical
   but very effective solution.
   I easily foresee the following possible advantages:
     * strong simplification / elimination of any not strictly
       indispensable component.
     * easier maintenance / faster version update cycle
     * enhanced stability / more robustness
     * better overall platform consistency (many further
       components as e.g. MapServer, or may be Python plugins
       as well, would then use the same identical GDAL driver).
   And I'm unable foresee any possible disadvantage, because
   the GDAL driver will effectively support anything required
   by QGIS in order to read/write spatial features from a
   SpatiaLite db-file.

bye Sandro

Message-ID: <CAFcOn29DXhJmD08fp7muJ7tiuUBsHH65n3-E5Zy0z-4UiE9t2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Mateusz, hi all

Four years ago you submitted the "OGR Layer Converter" plugin to QGIS trunk
(http://hub.qgis.org/issues/1249 ). Since then OGR became part of the usual
"Open Vector Layer..." dialog.
But this "open..." dialog includes no parameter ogr2ogr would have -
neither source nor target creation layer options.
What do you think of a revival of the plugin which would give control to an
advanced user over those options?

Hi,

I meant use an integer to store the data, and only "mimic" the serial for
Shapefiles and other formats. Though I did not take into account the
edition of the file by external programs... On (messy) workaround could be
to compare the last row id when openinig the Shapefile for checking if it
has been changed outside QGIS, and if needed compute the max(id) +1 to
recalculate the next serial status. It sounds a bit na?ve, but could work..

I also agree Geopackage or Spatialite should be used instead of Shapefiles !

in the processing toolbox there is a tool (ogr converter) that does
exactly the same, and allows you to add specific parameters.

I submiited a PR today to fix issues with output formats strings

there are a few PR that add new features, can those be reviewed and

The workaround proposed in the bug report did not work. And I have now
realized that the screenshot DOES depend of the platform. I will have to
keep the windows screenshot for now.

Thank you all for your help.

Why not adding a CONTRIBUTING.md file, following the suggestions from Jody?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use Georeferencer Core-Plugin with python
Message-ID: <5379DE92.4080506@uni-weimar.de>

Hello everybody,
i am from a project-team of the Bauhaus-University Weimar (Germany). Our 
Team want to implement a plugin for QGIS, which help help to extract 
borders of historical maps semi-automatically. We start to write the 
plugin in python and need now the functionality of the Georeferencer 
Core-Plugin, after we load the images of the historical maps. Can we 
access the functions of this plugin with python or maybe the whole 
plugin in our pipeline?

OS: Linux Fedora 20
QGIS: 2.2.0-Valmiera

Thank you

Felix Schmidt

That date 2014-05-20 should actually read 2014-05-23, right?

I am about to finish and push first part of the legend refactoring, so
I want to make sure I do not have to work all night long to have it
all ready by tomorrow :-)

I also consider a change of return value from void to non-void to be
source compatible change and therefore allowed.

Hi Felix,
I fear you will have to write your own bindings if you want to leavarage
the Georeferencer plugin code. It's a plugin, so it's functionality isn't
exposed through QGIS API.

It depends on what parts of the Georeferencer you need. If you don't need
the GUI but only the math, you could consider writing a SIP wrapper
around QgsGeorefTransformInterface implementations [1].
Otherwise, if Python performance would suffice, you could grab the low
level math from QgsGeorefTransform and QgsLeastSquares [2] and translate it
to Python.

Hi Radim,

I had the same problem. It has something to do with the customwidgets
from QGIS. Actually making them available for designer.

It is just changed from default not install to default install it.
But (as you) I install only locally, so am not allowed to install .so
files into the directory.

So I ran 'sudo make install', BUT then you get another problem: there is
a new dependecy now on qgis.gui module (which I do not have globally) so
this breaks your pyqt. So I would not do this.

Denis is aware of the problem, and looking for a solution.

(For me part of the solution would be to NOT default do this
installation into my global system.)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi,

The libqgis_customwidgets is a new library which allow using specific QGIS widgets directly in Qt Designer (if compiled with Qt4).
Now, this lib needs to be in Qt plugin?s directory to work properly. So this will require to run make as install as root.

You can disable this by running cmake with -DWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS=FALSE

Regarding the second problem described by Richard it should be fixed. pyuic will not bug anymore, even if QGIS is not installed.

I don?t know what?s the best default value for this library installation. 
But it might be better to reset it to false, if one wants that the default install can be run not being root.

Cheers,

Denis

The python modules gui and core are exported and the "iface" variable 
(QgisInterface) knows about their presence. But QgisInterface should 
not have any dependencies on plugin code, therefore it's harder to 
access this code.
It may not be hard if you only make use of code which you use in a 
standalone library way (maybe that would already be enough for your 
case). If you want to get access to a running plugin instance this is a 
different story. You can have a look at the code in [1] for an example 
of how this might be accomplished. Although the code seems not to be 
working, I've got to check what's still missing there, but in principle 
the ideas in commit [1] should work.

Best,
Matthias

It should probably be disabled by default when CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is set
(to avoid this error), but it would make sense to make it default if
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
is not set (which requires to install as root). Don't know if it's easy to
do that in cmake though.

Of course Matthias is right if you want to interface with a plugin instance
running inside QGIS. That's why I said you could bind only the inner logic
of the Georeferencer to use it "outside" the plugin instance. In case you
need to control, or get work done from, the Georeferencer plugin itself you
have to do what Matthias is doing in its commit.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Gradient fill data defined properties localization
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYq--+fwNYM4XxJve-BxXV6Qxcdt9_fH7V500kMXNJ5JUQ@mail.gmail.com>

Gradient fill data defined properties keywords, e.g.
  gradient type: linear, radial, conical
  coordinate mode: feature, viewport
  spread: pad, repeat, reflect
are currently localized (translated). I believe that such keywords
(data defined in general) should not be translated to keep project
portability. Opinions?

it is weeks now that I see this issue. I asked around and have been
told that "it works fine here", so I supposed that was just my issue.

Here it seems to happen when a layer is in projected CRS and OTFR is
off or project has the same CRS as layer (i.e no reprojection). It
works if the layer is in geographic CRS or OTFR is on and project has
different CRS.

Same error with yesterday nigthly on ubuntu 14.04. A quick temp fix is to uninstall python-qgis, finish the upgrade and reinstall
python-qgis.

Hello All,


I updated GEarthView to 1.0.5  version, that fixes a bug when reprojection
is active.

This version also inserted a link to OSRM.

QgsMapCanvas::readProject() was setting extent before CRS. It should
be fixed in b385467.

Hi all.
We are using the relations with custom forms, and we have frequent
occurrences of a relation being broken. Removing it from the form and
putting it back again fixes it. It is unclear what triggers this
problem. Any hint on how to debug it?
In addition, the joins of the child table with the parent table seems
not to be updated when saving.
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo,

Are you referring to drag and drop designer? There's a bug report open 
[1].
Please contact me if you know somebody who would be able to support 
fixing this issue.

For the other one, I am not sure what exactly you mean. Is this a bug 
or a usability issue? Is a report open yet?

Best
Matthias

Hi all.
We are approaching 2.4. It would be good if someone could revise the
patches and pull requests:

http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/issues?query_id=32
41 patches

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pulls
47 ulls

Some of them (especially among the patches) should probably be closed,
some are duplicates, some may be good. A quick cleanup could probably
bring down the numbers considerably.

All the best, and thanks.

Yes, apparently this is the problem. Not so easi to replicate it here
though.

None currently, I'll try.

The issue is: when adding records to the child table, joined with the
parent one, the data from the parent are not updated immediately.
Reopening the project fixes this, but during digitizing this is confusing.

Thanks.

Hi all,

I was trying to update my plugin on plugin.qgis.com. At my previous
attempts it work perfect but at this time I get an error and does not
upload my plugin. I get this error "There were errors reading plugin
package (please check also your plugin's metadata). Could not unzip file."

I only changed the version in the metadata.txt

Do you have any idea?

it works fine here

It might be that you have a plugin that has a package called qgis, which
might be shadowing the core one.

This seems to be due to my changes today, although I'm not sure what is
going on unless I stuffed up the cmake files.

qgis.core is now a package i.e folder and it imports the sip modules, now
called _core, _gui, etc.

For some reason the package is missing the core, gui, package folders.

Hi,

I also have troubles with Python plugins and bindings. For example build failed
with error

[  6%] Generating ui_frmVectorGrid.py

Check that you are using the latest version of PyQt and send an error report to
support at riverbankcomputing.com, including the following information:

  * your version of PyQt (4.9.1)
  * the UI file that caused this error
  * the debug output of pyuic4 (use the -d flag when calling pyuic4)

This is strange, as my system has Qt 4.8.2 not 4.9.1 Cleant rebuild
and install doesn't
helps.

Hi Alexander,

that is another problem, discussed yesterday.

You have a build which installed soem customwidgets stuff for qgis
widgets to be used in Qt-Designer

The option:
-DWITH_CUSTOM_WIDGETS=FALSE
would have prevented that, but was enabled by default.
Since today it is false again by default I think...

The problem is that by the global install you have a

qgis_customwidgets.py somewhere in
/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/PyQt4.

and a libqgis_customwidgets.so.2.3.0 file somehere around
/usr/lib/qt4/plugins/designer/

both should be removed if you do not have the qgis libs installed globally.

All this is solved now, but I think you should remove those to be clean
again.

Regards,

Richard

Hi Richard,

Thanks for reply, I already found this by myself and started to write email to

Hello List,



University of Copenhagen would like to apply for hosting Developer-meeting / Hackfest in spring 2015.



We have a Forestry College 45 km north of Copenhagen, where we have the organization and facilities for accommodation, canteen, rooms for work and place for 'time off'.



We don?t know the procedures for such an application, so if anyone on the list could help, it would be appreciated.

Hi Lene,
thanks a lot for this. Your letter is good for us as an application, and I'm sure
your location is an excellent one. Please consider that we already had a similar,
equally attracting, offer for next spring in Catalunya, so perhaps we should compare
the two (if friends in Catalunya are still interested).
All the best.

oh, I see, still no new package; sorry for the noise, and thanks for the fix.
now compiling.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgis freezes when opening attribute table of a
 postgis layer without key value
Message-ID: <1400666007524-5141587.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm facing a severe bug in qgis 2.2 and master here. 
I have layers defined in existing project that do not have a key in
datasource definition. 
It seems that when a table has a oid field, postgis connection dialog does
not ask for a key field (it is a multi column primary key in that case).
When i had manually in definition string key=oid,  all seems fine. 
The major problem is that most user existing project will be impacted. 

Did I miss something? Why is key=oid no more explicitly written in
datasource def? 

Thanks for your lights
R?gis

Hi again, 
I'm probably totally wrong in the previous analysis.
It seems that this is related to table with multiple geometry columns. Maybe
new attribute caching just can index additionnal geometry columns. 
Anyway, this is still really severe.  Anyone confirms?

AFAIK the last postgres versione dismiss by default the oid.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Questing about PAL modifications
Message-ID: <1400675353676-5141630.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I started to port the PAL library to Java. I found that a few improvements
and fixes were made to the source within QGIS but werent backported to the
library[1]. As the original library is available under LGPL I wanted to ask
for your permission to make your modifications available under LGPL as well.

>From the gitlog[2] I found that contributions were made by:

If I'm missing something or someone, please let me know!


Best regards,

Hi,

If there's anything you can use from my commits to the PAL library, 
please feel free to use it under LGPL and beerware terms :-)

If you can find any - feel free to use any pal improvements and fixes I did
under LGPL.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Legend refactoring branch merged
Message-ID: <CAC2XbFc=EN_zSo+dai_aU5+jwR3wzCotqPxs3FCtByNfSEJ_Aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone

I have just merged the first part of the legend refactoring work to
master [1]. It does not really bring any new features for the end
user, the changes are mainly under the hood. Things should ideally
work as before, if not then probably it is a bug.

There will be second part of the work related mainly around improved
layer symbology display in legend, more interactive legend and more
options for customization. At Lutra Consulting we are still looking
for funders willing to co-fund the work. At this point let me thank
SIGE and Swiss QGIS User Group for supporting the project.

Please test thoroughly - the legend has received quite a lot of
features over time, so there could be still some minor features I have
missed to port to new implementation.

The format of the project file has changed, but there is backward
compatibility with older projects which should allow seamless
transition. Once saved with 2.4, the older versions of QGIS will loose
the information about grouping.

If you are interested in studying the new code, there are two new
folders of interest:
- src/core/layertree
- src/gui/layertree
There is basic doxygen documentation for the new core classes, I plan
to add more, add python bindings and unit tests.

Regards
Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] geodetic formulas
Message-ID: <1400694155786-5141732.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, in this document
http://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Order/8260.54A.pdf in Appendix 2
there are lots of calculations and algorithms for solving some useful
problems when working with non projected data e.g. EPSG 4326

There is also this github repo https://github.com/pkohut/GeoFormulas and
http://wired2code.wordpress.com/2010/07/14/wgs84-ellipsoid-calculations/

Apparently they are written in C and I am wondering if maybe QGIS could
benefit from it, I would really want to port this to python also but I am
still very new to programming to actually achieve this

Anyway I hope someone with more skills than me can review this and maybe see
if this can be used for QGIS

Regards

I mean QgsLayerTreeRegistryBridge class

and adding the menus in QgsAppLayerTreeViewMenuProvider::createContextMenu()

sorry about so many email, my gmail is flaky.

A quick test revealed that layer actions added via
QgsLegendInterface::addLegendLayerAction()
and addLegendLayerActionForLayer() do not show up in the context menu any
more.

Should the corresponding members be added to QgsLayerTreeLayer class?

Hi Martin,

Thanks for your work on this and for the sponsors that supported it!

Couples things I noticed:

* There is no longer and indication that a layer is in edit mode, or not,
i.e. the edit pencil icon, and its relative states (red or yellow), is gone.

* There is no longer an indication of the active layer, previously the one
underlined. This is different than the currently selected layer(s). The
underline would persist with no selection, or multiple selections, and
would mirror the view's currentItem(), or in maybe now currentIndex(). When
iface.activeLayer() is used in console, it should return the identical
layer in the legend that is underlined, or otherwise indicated as active.

* Something is funky with the connections between the legend and the
Current Edits functionality. After a layer is no layers are editable
anymore, the submenu is still active, offering to cancel edits. I added
that code, and can investigate more after the feature freeze.

* There is no longer a tool tip when hovering over the layer, showing the
layer's source definition.

* When opening one project, QGIS crashed with the following (project never
loads):

Exception Type:  EXC_BAD_ACCESS (SIGSEGV)
Exception Codes: KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS at 0x0000000000000010

Thanks a lot for the feedback. Will address that shortly.

Oh, sorry about that. Something must have gone wrong with a vector
layer's symbol. I can't see where the problem could be straight away -
would it be possible for you to send me the project file - or see if
you can provide more information how to replicate the problem?

Interesting. So your changes will be in Qgis 2.4?
Another question: one thing that was missing to plugins is to set the
layer position in the legend, after I've added it to the map... It's
now possible with your commit?

Yes.

Yes, plugins now have full control of project's layer tree. Simply
obtain the tree (QgsProject::layerTreeRoot()), create a new layer node
(QgsLayerTreeLayer) and add it where it should go
(QgsLayerTreeGroup::insertChildNode()). You will probably want to add
the layer to layer registry without emitting a signal from registry
(QgsMapLayerRegistry::addMapLayer(layer, false)) otherwise it will be
added to the layer tree twice.

Python bindings for the new classes are coming very soon.

Enjoy :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plugin Upload
Message-ID: <CAJkkYzY04rfd=d3U4BKUm2skTjp4_FstaNtUD6A8BzVED=uojQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

I'm trying to upload my first plugin to:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/add/

I keep getting the following error:

There were errors reading plugin package (please check also your plugin's
metadata). Package name must start with an ASCII letter and can contain
ASCII letters, digits and the signs '-' and '_'.

My package name is "DEMTools" and I've checked the plugin's metadata file,
but everything looks to be in order. This error message doesn't give me a
lot to go on and I've never uploaded a plugin before. Are there some common
issues I should look for or is there some detailed guide to creating a
plugin package for *upload*.
(I don't need help with creating the plugin just uploading it to the Plugin
Repository. I used Plugin Builder to create the plugin and it runs fine on
my local machine.)

Thanks for any help you can offer,
Kris

Hi all.
Just compiled and installed current master. Loading stylized data I get

Warning: Loading a style file that was saved with an older version of qgis (saved in
1.8.0-Lisboa, loaded in 2.3.0-Master). Problems may occur.

and nothing is displayed. Switching back to single symbol does not solve the problem.
Loading non stylized data works fine.

Anything I should investigate more to pin down the issue?

All the best.

Hi,

Can't we just say that old styling and old labeling does not work anymore?

As a migration path someone could use QGIS 2.0 or QGIS 2.2.

That means for somebody to be required to first install an intermediate 
software before the release - which might not even be easily available.

I think we can do that for QGIS 3 and maybe for some rare cases before, 
but to be able to migrate from something saved with a software being 
the last stable not even 12 months ago sounds not optimal to me.

I don't know how much work is involved in this particular case, so I 
really can't tell for sure, but this sounds like a rather serious issue.
I have inserted a new class QgsLegacyHelpers (going to be committed 
with my update later today) which is meant to contain code for such 
situations and does all the update for forms to the new system, but it 
would be good to have other mappings in there as well.

In short: if there's not an incredibly huge amount of work or other 
good reasons, in terms of user satisfaction, I'd be all in favor of 
providing an easy upgrade path throughout a major release cycle (2.x 
series).

Seems to work for me. Tested with points/lines/polys shapefiles in
QGIS source: tests/testdata. Those shapefiles come with .qml files
which still use old symbology. Similar warning is emitted, just the
saved version is 1.9.90.

Hi all.
Thanks for loking into this. Trying it again, some of the layers are now displayed.
Some are not, and switching them off results in a crash (probably unrelated).
Symbols are new, not old symbology.
Data and styles available if useful.
All the best

I have just pushed a fix for the crash you mentioned in your mail.

Please feel free to file a bug and attach the data. I believe the
legend refactoring should not be the cause of those problems...

Hi Martin,

Thanks for the quick fixes. All of my reported issues were addressed. The
reported funky connection issue appears to be my mistake. I believe I must
have had a layer still in edit mode somewhere in the legend when I thought
there was none. Could not reproduce that issue.

However, I did notice that the new legend is not quite the same as the old.
You can now edit the name of the layer directly with a click-hover. Very
nice!

Geez, all that work and only one small new feature? :-)

Thanks again for upgrading the previous legend's tangled and limiting code.
Looking forward to the new features and usability this will bring.

Regards,

Larry

Hi dev,

 

I seem to remember there was a talk of calling QGIS master, "QGIS Release
Candidate", between feature freeze and  final release dates. This and a
coordinated campaign  will help to get users to test and report as many bugs
as possible before the final release.

Cheers,

Saber

Hmm. While that feature is nice, it is a little too easy to rename a layer.
For example, double-clicking the name of a legend layer to bring up
properties (if set in Options) leaves the layer name in an editable state.
Upon closing the properties dialog, any keyboard input changes the layer
name in the legend, because the keyboard focus is still active there.

Maybe ensure the name is not editable when a double-click is detected?
While that would fix the noted issue, it doesn't address how often the
layer's name becomes unintentionally editable during normal legend use.

Any ideas on how to leave the mouse-activated name changing but reduce
unintentional editing?

Regards,

Larry

You mean this ?

This need to modificate manually the svgs t add some tokens inside them.

Hi Stefan,

Are you able to open SOSI files in QGIS? In 64 bit QGIS master (as you mentioned I don?t get the option for SOSI files in 32 bit), I get a dialog asking me if I want to load the points, lines or polygons from the SOSI file, but then I just get an error message telling me that it is not a valid data source.

Hi Larry,

I tried now with QGIS 2.3 nightly build (2.3.0-81) in OSGeo4W.
When I try to open a SOSI file in QGIS I still get the ?Invalid Source? error message.
The gdal-sosi-plugin package in OSGeo4W is built against GDAL 1.10. Can that be a problem? Will I have to rebuild the plugin against GDAL 1.11 in order to make it accessible for QGIS (ogrinfo --format lists SOSI).
Or is the solution to install OSGeo4W from scratch?

Any other ideas?

Cheers
Stefan

I second Stefan's comments. Having direct SOSI support will really strengthen the position of QGIS here in Norway.

We do a lot of work with SOSI, and it would be great to open (and eventually edit) SOSI files directly rather than having to convert them first.

I added an extension filter for SOSI to QGIS master [0].

Also, for Mac, I added Homebrew formulae for the OpenFYBA lib (fyba) [1] and a GDAL/OGR shared plugin (gdal-sosi) [2]. The SOSI support was recently added to the base GDAL formula (gdal) [3], so recompiling it after installation of fyba will also work, e.g.:
$ brew tap osgeo/osgeo4mac
$ brew update
Then...

$ brew upgrade gdal   <-- this will install 1.11.0 'bottle,' if not already done
$ brew install fyba
$ brew install gdal-sosi  <-- installs ogr_SOSI.dylib plugin in HOMEBREW_PREFIX/lib/gdalplugins/

Or...
$ brew install fyba
$ brew reinstall gdal --build-from-source --enable-unsupported
QGIS built against GDAL/OGR 1.11 with the sample .sos file loaded [4].
Please submit any issues with fyba or gdal-sosi formulae to OSGeo4Mac tracker [5].

Emne: Re: [Qgis-developer] GDAL 1.11 new formats

Yes, though I have to admit that I have no experience with building GDAL with SOSI support on Mac, but I know that the underling OpenFYBA lib has been successfully build on Mac, so I assume the Unix build hints should apply for Mac also  for GDAL/OGR.

Probably I should note, that the free map data of the Norwegian Mapping Authority (http://data.kartverket.no/download/) also come in SOSI format (vector)...

Hello Stefan,

That is very interesting.  Are all of your notes included on the GDAL Buildhints page, for Windows and Linux/Mac?

Anybody volunteering to try/test this and write a short piece of text
about it for the manual?
(not sure where to put this though)

Hi 

On current master (Ubuntu 12.04) I'm unable to add a new feature to existing layers (shape, postgis). I can digitize the geometry and the form pops up but I cannot enter values into the form and the ok button is greyed out.

Can anyone confirm this or do I  have to change some magic new setting?

Hi, 
Same here, with postgis data . Quite a bug!
Also when copying data, no way to copy to an existing layer. Option is
greyed out.

Yups, my problem was that the data was a linestringM data, not editable in
any version of QGIS. 
 new features and copy-paste works all rigth for supported geometries here.
sorry for the noise.

You might want to check the configuration of the fields in the layer 
properties and report which field causes the problem.

There is a new widget API and there might be some problem with the 
translation from old to new widgets.

Yes, I confirm for last master, at least on shapes and sqlite.

This is strange, I tested just after Matthias' merge and did not had any 
trouble.

Can't tell which commit brought the trouble though.

Hi again, 
my problem is unsolved. I eliminated either additionnal geometry column or
oid/ pk / select at id causes. 

for a very simple postgis table, no way to open the attribute table, Qgis
freezes and transaction needs to be aborted on postgres side. 

Any idea? Am I alone?

see table definition : 
-- Table: dce.masse_eau_anomalie

-- DROP TABLE dce.masse_eau_anomalie;

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal for new features selection
 functionalities in Digitizing Tool Bar
Message-ID: <CAPkWpvfmCBH9BL_qfZAOs43jZeTOdF9rmFi8-YWJQM34Xft6CQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We would like to have your feedbacks on our proposition to add new
selection functionnalities in the Digitizing Tool Bar.

These functions come from the 'SELECTPLUSFR' extensions, developed by
Christophe
MASSE (french Ministry of Ecology) and available here :

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/selectplus/

 Originally 'SELECTPLUS' is a collection of tools for selecting objects on
vectors historically developed by Barry Rowlingson and supplemented by
Carson JQ Farmer.


SELECTPLUSFR includes a ?Create Drawn Objects? tool that allows user to
create circles or rectangles.
Our proposal is to add the ?Create Drawn Objects? tool into the
?digitizing? tool bar.

The procedure is as follows :

   -

   *Click* button to initialize the command ;
   -

   *Click in the map window* to place the center of the circle and get the
   box set the properties of the circle (object proposed default).

The it is possible to :


   -

   change the type object ;
   -

   previewing dynamic drawing of the object ;
   -

   move the object by changing the X and Y coordinates (or scroll button) ;
   -

   change the attributes of the object : a circle radius or width and
   height for a rectangle (or scroll button) ;
   -

   change the label associated with the object ;
   -

   change associated with the object position (*only for rectangles*) ;
   -

   switch to the current way (map window) or general control ;
   -

   recall the X and Y coordinates of the last point raised in the map
   window ;
   -

   change the selection option on the layer to achieve (interaction with
   toolbar) ;
   -

   make a selection with the object (no need to create it) ;
   -

   create object (memory layer).


If this proposal gets your attention and interest, we could be able to work
on it for the version after 2.4.

All feedbacks welcome !

Thanks !

Dear all,

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/selectplus/

 Originally 'SELECTPLUS' is a collection of tools for selecting objects on
vectors historically developed by Barry Rowlingson and supplemented by
Carson JQ Farmer.

 *Proposal 1* : Add the possibility for the user to make selection on :

   - Active layer (see the window control layers QGIS) or
   - All layers or
   - first layer ( layer "highest" in the order of layers) or
   - first content selection (search for all layers and stops at the first
   layer that returns a selection ).

A combo list will be added with these 4 options.

*Proposal 2* : Add two functions in the existing combo list (Select single
feature, Select features by rectangle, ?) :

   - Select all features,
   - Select features by diameters : similar to the select features by
   radius functionality,

 *Proposal 3* : Add a new tool called ?Invert selection? which would simply
select all features that are not presently selected and unselect the
previously selected features.

 *Proposal 4* : Add a new tool that would allow user to choose the operator
used for selection. In fact, when QGIS is only using ?intersects?,
SELECTPLUSFR plugin provides the possibility to choose among these other
operators :


   -

   Within
   -

   Overlaps
   -

   Contains
   -

   Crosses
   -

   Disjoint
   -

   Equals
   -

   Touches
   -

   DE-9IM operator

 For DE-9IM operator, the user can define the mask to be used.


If this proposal gets your attention and interest, we could be able to work
on it for the version after 2.4.

All feedbacks welcome !

Dear all,

We would like to have your feedbacks on our proposition to add new

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/selectplus/

 Originally 'SELECTPLUS' is a collection of tools for selecting objects on
vectors historically developed by Barry Rowlingson and supplemented by
Carson JQ Farmer.

*Proposal *:

 The ?intersect? tool from the GeoProcessing Tools could be generalized so
that the user can :


   -

   Choose to select on the active layer only, or on all layers, or on first
   layer (layer "highest" in the order of layers), or on first content
   selection (search for all layers and stops at the first layer that returns
   a selection).
   -

   Perform the intersection only with selected features.
   -

   Choose the operator among Within, Overlaps, Contains, Crosses, Disjoint,
   Equals, Intersects (default operator), Touches, DE-9IM operator (with the
   possibility to set options)
   -

   Choose between creating a new layer, creating a memory layer or making a
   selection on a target layer*.


 * Selection on a target layer : Selection on target requires that the
active layer (which will provide the target) has at least one selection.
Target selection on all layers are scanned. The active layer itself is
scanned or not according to the option selection.



If this proposal gets your attention and interest, we could be able to work
on it for the version after 2.4.

Making a view from that table goes well.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal for new features in ftools (geometry)
Message-ID: <CAPkWpvd1JEcKi+4+t611bFw-npid2yfUdFctYw_fRE8vNCWTpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

We would like to have your feedbacks on our proposition to add new
functionnalities in ftools.

These functions come from the 'SELECTPLUSFR' extensions, developed by
Christophe
MASSE (french Ministry of Ecology) and available here :

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/selectplus/

 Originally 'SELECTPLUS' is a collection of tools for selecting objects on
vectors historically developed by Barry Rowlingson and supplemented by
Carson JQ Farmer.

SELECTPLUSFR includes functionalities to create derived features : see
attached doc

The ftools Geometry Tools could be generalized so that the user can :


   -

   limit the operation to selected features
   -

   Choose the type of creation : convex hull, convex hull on for all...
   -

   Choose between creating a new layer or creating a memory layer

If this proposal gets your attention and interest, we could be able to work
on it for the version after 2.4.

All feedbacks welcome !

Thanks !

Qgis 1.8 is concerned too. This is probably something on postgres side then.

We seem to have trouble with cursors. 
here is postgres log when trying to open attribute table in qgis:

and that is all, the binary cursor creation stays idle.

other symptoms are that identify or select actions on map consider all
objects as one multi point.

QGIS 2.2 tries to create cursors infinitly.. when qgis 1.8 let first cursor
transaction idle. 

Creating the table raw without any constraint in another schema works. 

if anybody finds one day what happens, I'll be happy to learn..

R?gis

Message-ID: <CAMKXKO4-_jAAYRHSm37fLoKavcEiqP+qgvc_x1ngji9B6M4Jpg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs, Marco, Ren?-Luc,

I have some people giving feedback about the current JPEG compression. Many
users think the "FORMAT=image/jpeg" parameters in the GetMap requests
produce poor quality images.

I guess the "80%"  rate is used. I think it could be enough to increase it
to 90 to produce better looking images (I personaly create my pyramid with
this option with gdal), or better to leave the choice when installing QGIS
Server by using a config parameter.

Any feedback welcome

Michael

Or even better, having it layer per layer. Like we do for png , for example
FORMAT=image%2Fpng%3B mode%3D8bit  -> image 8 bits

Why not
FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg%3B compression%3D90
I guess it is not standard ?

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xBptzEjRAXrBr1UyFZuTGbEdgiDtR2wGt8-Ff_YnqoQA@mail.gmail.com>

Recently I had to calculate the relative dimension of a polygon relative to
the others of the same class. I know there are a lot of way to do it,
inside and outside QGIS, but I wondered if field calculator (and
expressions in general) couls be extended to accompish this kind of tasks.

The approach would be something similar WINDOW functions in Postgresql [1],
where for each record a new value will be calculated on the basis of other
records (filtered or not).

Has this ever been discussed? Is it something that could fit QGIS
expressions?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [ANNOUNCE] 2.3 feature freeze begun
Message-ID: <537FA228.6080406@norbit.de>

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.3 development cycle ended at 
12:00 UTC. We are now in feature freeze on the road to the 2.4 release 
on 2014-06-20 
<http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20140620T12&year=2014&month=6&day=20&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&msg=2.4%20Release> 
(almost 28 days away; see also roadmap 
<http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#road-map.html>).

Now *we*, *the community*, need to prepare QGIS for release. No new 
features will be added anymore. *Users*, if not already begun, should 
now start extensive testing of master and report bugs on the hub 
<http://hub.qgis.org>. *Developers* should move their focus from 
creating new features to fixing bugs. *Translators* can can continue 
their work (Werner updated the translations in master. Thanks! Note that 
this might be an incremental process as - although there is feature

Thanks J?rgen for this reminder

We should provide a HTML page with some help how to download and test the
master version. Otherwise Windows, Linux and Mac users who are not
developpers (and compilers) would not be able to help us testing the master
version.

I remember there is one download page with a new Master Windows build every
week. Having the same for other distributions would help. Do you think
builders could provide some help to build a  single wiki page "Try the last
Master for Windows, Linux and mac distros ? Or this page already exists ?

Having a single link could help us in this list to call for testers among
the end users (via twitter and other channels)

Hi,

I'd like to remind everyone that the 2.3 development cycle ended at 12:00 UTC. We are now in feature freeze on the road to the 2.4 release on 2014-06-20<http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=1440&iso=20140620T12&year=2014&month=6&day=20&hour=12&min=0&sec=0&msg=2.4%20Release> (almost 28 days away; see also roadmap<http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#road-map.html>).

Now we, the community, need to prepare QGIS for release. No new features will be added anymore.  Users, if not already begun, should now start extensive testing of master and report bugs on the hub<http://hub.qgis.org>. Developers should move their focus from creating new features to fixing bugs.   Translators can can continue their work (Werner updated the translations in master. Thanks!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] GSOC Weekly Report 1: Schematization Plug-in for
	QGIS
Message-ID: <CABRzcz85HNTvdZWEKHwXJWVGPuESosyFKuBprF_5kXXUQFq_Fw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
Please find the GSOC Weekly report 1 in the following email.


*Weekly report 1*

*What was done this week?*

   - During the bonding period it was decided after discussions with the
   mentors that we would create the plug-in by integrating it with the already
   existing functions of Processing
Toolbox<http://www.qgis.org/en/docs/user_manual/processing/toolbox.html>.
   So this week mostly took to getting acquainted with various different
   functionalities of the toolbox.


   - For simplification of geometry,
QgsTopologyPreservingSimplifier<http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsTopologyPreservingSimplifier.html>class
will be used as the implementation is similar to Douglas Peucker
   algorithm and also gives us the advantage of preserving the topology. There
   were some errors in the output for some data sets but otherwise it is
   working good enough. Those errors are reduced if we are merging small
   segments of the lines and then splitting them at the intersection before
   simplification.

*What is the plan for next week?*

   - Implement a basic plug-in which removes objects smaller than a certain
   threshold. This would be a good start and will provide an initial setup for
   the plug-in and act as a base for it. This function for removing the
   smaller objects might create topology errors, so this would be available as
   an option in the plug-in.

Message-ID: <CALCNqkb3amX25zpFJrH-PFrWTb09HbLRQAwU7DcyKJk5P99h6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Feature freeze is here and I would like to start compiling the visual
changelog for QGIS 2.4.0 'Chugiak'.

I have set up a new version on
http://changelog.linfiniti.com/qgis/version/2.4.0/

Could I invite contributors and interested observers to highlight the cool
new features that have come into QGIS in this release cycle on the above
site. You need to log in to create an account and then start creating
'entries' for the 'version'. Please note that the software on that website
is still very much a work in progress rather than a statement of perfection
so please bear with the odd glitch you may encounter.

For those who have asked before, yes we do intend to support a native QGIS
domain for that site in the future, but currently the idea is for us to
compile the changelog there and then it will be exported by RSS feed or RST
export over to the live QGIS web site.

If you can't be bothered to actually use the site above, no problem, just
mail me with a paragraph or two describing the new feature, and a nice
screenshot (if possible) that shows it off. Please note there is a limit of
1 screenshot per feature (entry). Also don't worry of you are not a native
english speaker, I am happy to edit any submissions into the Queen's
english.

Regards

Tim

Ok, sorry for the noise... I did not notice the links in your email
pointing to the adequate pages. I am still a bit tired after the great
foss4gfr we had in Paris this week ;)

J?rgen, maybe a single very short HTML page in QGIS website with the
content of your email would be a good idea ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] have aggregate/window expressions ever been

Hi, 
well, this is something I miss, coming from Mapinfo world. 

Some tests are being made currently on French ministry of ecology, and by
Nathan also, to head to some kind of a layer abstraction, based on ogr
virtual layer and ogr sqlite engine. 

Once done, that would open a large field of new features and dedicated
gui's:
 - SQL assistant (mapinfo like / qspatialite like) on any loaded data source
and without any explicit import step. This includes aggregate functions
 - virtual attribute or spatial columns based on functions
 - ETL feature for changing data types and structure
 
FME is providing such kind of SQLexecutor, with some limits currently, and
that is extremly powerfull in processing tools, allowing to take full
advantage of existing algorithm for geospatial computing, and SQL-spatial
SQL for attribute queries AND processing. 

If we find a way to be sure that any datasource can be correctly used
without caveats hard to understand for the end user, I think we will have
the best GIS tool ever done for non 3D uses. Still I see some limits with
SQLITE. For instance, many SQL clauses are partially supported. Or
calculated fields in view can't be explicitly cast, so QGIS should have to
guess data type based on a data scan (a major unadressed issue of sqlite)

I wish I had more time now to investigate by myself. 

Nathan , Hugo , could you tell us more on that topic? is ogr sqlite engine
the right target or does is have to much limitations? 

Cheers
R?gis

Hi Regis,
it's a long time I think to what you're descriibing, and that would
definitely be on a higher level then aggregate expressions alone. This
level of abstraction would also be basis for a map/reduce pattern analysis.
It would be great to know some more about what has been discussed so far.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Proposal for new features in ftools (geometry)

Hi Fr?d?ric

Having read your proposals, they all look great to me. If you are able to,
what about more generally taking over maintainership of ftools?

Also would comment that it would be great if these functions could be
provided as processing plugins too.

Regards

Tim

Hi,

I'm definitely more of a user than developer, & have not compiled QGIS now for several years (no need these days - thank you all!!)
I've been using QGIS under various distros of Linux (Mandrake, PCLOS, Ubuntu, OpenSUSE, Fedora, Mint, etc) since QGIS v0.2, way back when...

I just built a new 32 bit VM of Linux Mint 17 RC (based on Ubuntu Trusty v14.04) , and applied all updates.
Added the Postgres repository (according to instructions):
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ trusty-pgdg main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'
wget --quiet -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

Added the Ubuntu dev snapshot repository (listed in J?rgen's email) the same way:
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb???? http://qgis.org/debian-nightly trusty main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list'

Updated the package list:
sudo apt-get update

And then fired up Synaptic to install the software I wanted, which includes (amongst lots of others) Postgres 9.3, Postgis 2.1, QGIS dev (v2.3)

Added my user as a Postgres superuser, created a test db, connected & added a Postgis extension, edited pg_hba.conf to allow trusted access from localhost, reloaded the postgresql service & started QGIS, then connected to my new db.

Everything worked perfectly, & I now have an updateable VM running the dev version of QGIS to test with - including Postgis connection functionality which is critical for me. I concede that this procedure might be a bit daunting for a casual user, but for anyone familiar with Linux, it was just a matter of finding the relevant instructions (and repositories) and going through a normal setup process for installing software apps on a fresh Mint (Ubuntu) install.

Now to load some plugins, data, symbologies, etc & try it out...


My thanks to all those who's work allows people like me to do this stuff, and have it "just work!"


Brent Wood

Ok, sorry for the noise... I did not notice the links in your email pointing to the adequate pages. I am still a bit tired after the great foss4gfr we had in Paris this week ;)

J?rgen, maybe a single very short HTML page in QGIS website with the content of your email would be a good idea ?

Hey Brent,

You should check out the PostGIS docker images, makes it even easier to get
going.

Hi Michael/Lene,

if one of you writes down a text file with the information, instructions
and links in it and sent it to me, that would be great.
I will then create a page in the website for it.

Any idea where a suitable place is?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi Richard,

I would suggest to use the "Get involved"- page  http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/index.html

Eg. : "We need testpersons for the next version -  Install the latest version - new every week"

Report bug at xxxx mailinglist/Bugreport and then an example in how to report a bug.





Regards

Lene Fischer

How about adding the call for testers to the front page carousel?

I think I also remember a discussion about a "news" bar at the top of
the front page (right under the menu) where we could add important
temporary information such as a call for testers.

Best wishes,
Anita

The next weekly build could be spinned as a technical preview build and
advertised on the homepage / blog / social media. No additional efforts
required on the build front, just a bit of public PR.

How about adding the call for testers to the front page carousel?

I think I also remember a discussion about a "news" bar at the top of the front page (right under the menu) where we could add important temporary information such as a call for testers.

Best wishes,
Anita

R?gis,

I created the dce schema and the masse_eau_anomalie table inside. Added the 
view and import some data from SQL request in your last email.

I have no problem when opening attribute table windows or using the identify 
tools.

I am using QGIS master, with POSTGIS="2.1.2 r12389" GEOS="3.4.2-CAPI-1.8.2 
r3921" PROJ="Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012" GDAL="GDAL 1.12dev, released 
2014/04/16" LIBXML="2.9.1" LIBJSON="UNKNOWN" RASTER
and PostgreSQL 9.3.4.

Hope it can help in any way.

Hi Vincent,

Thank you for reporting.

I have verified the issue here and it appears to be only with the 10.7
nightly's build script and .app bundling (issue not present for 10.6
nightly). I believe I know what the problem is, but will not be able to
physically access that Mac until sometime today, as it shuts down after
building the nightly on weekends - so no remote access right now.

Unfortunately, there is no quick fix to apply to the nightly you have
already downloaded.

When I get a chance to fix it, I'll force another nightly build, since
today's was not successful (may be unrelated).

Regards,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Customized Android QGIS App Offer
Message-ID: <CAGpXA-xedR0_kO2+zk4e7wXmO0pyQ+4+bVDEFp7yDEjU5s+TDQ@mail.gmail.com>

We are a private company in need for a customized version of the QGIS app
for Android.
We have the nightly build version running, but the buttons are small and
it's not very touch friendly. There are issues with the windows, anything
maximized becomes out of range, so the alternative we found to restore that
window to its original place is erasing data (no need to uninstall).
We use SM-T210 tablets, the 7 inches one. Maybe a tablet with higher
resolution would allow us to use windows rightly, but we cannot change
tablets now, so what we need is a customized version of the Android app.
It also needs to interact with other apps, run data queries in Spatialite
and open PDF files using points' attributes.
Candidates may send offers to integracaomt at gmail.com

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Large scale and rounding issues
Message-ID: <BLU436-SMTP194BA3C3B072E880E6070C9BA380@phx.gbl>

Hi devs,

QGis allows quite a lot of zooming in: it is easy by playing with the 
mouse wheel to go to scales like 3,000,000:1. However, this does not 
mean QGis actually support them and different features will start to 
fail at different zoom level, some of them quite early. For example, 
labelling will fail around 1:1 in some cases (linked to geographic 
coordinate systems?). Node edition, snapping also fail quite early. 
Later, display starts to become erratic, with some lines or nodes 
disappearing randomly.

For example, http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10234 is a user doing some large 
scale mapping of a building in WGS84 (maybe not ideal, but in theory 
supported by QGis). He has some issues to select nodes for edition.

I looked in the code and found a culprit on qgsvectorlayer.cpp line 2451 
: there is a epsilon defined as "crs().geographicFlag() ? 1e-12 : 1e-8" 
, but this epsilon is later compared to the square of the distance, and 
the distance considered zero if smaller. This means that all distances 
below 1e-6 degree, which is around 10 cm, will be considered zero, which 
prevents selecting the correct node or segment.

Of course, this is not an issue for most use cases, but this can affect 
some legitimate use.

More important, the limits are not consistant and there is no guarantee 
for the user about which feature will be available or not at which level 
of precision.

I would like to restrict more strictly the zoom level (something like 
1000:1?), but ensure all features work as expected at these zoom levels 
(or maybe make two categories of zoom, a "normal" one where everything 
works and an "extended" one with no guarantee). Then the 
DEFAULT_SEGMENT_EPSILON and other constants can be derived for both 
geographic and projected coordinate systems.

What do you think ?

Leyan

Hi Vincent,

OK, the currently uploaded 10.7+ Mac nightly has been tested on 10.9.3 and
launches fine. There was a bundling bug, due to the framework IDs of Qt now
having a different structure, e.g.:

for `otool -L /Library/Frameworks/QtGui.framework/QtGui`...

4.8.5 = QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui
4.8.6 = /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-4.8.6/lib/QtGui.framework/Versions/4/QtGui

The result of this is that anything built against Qt 4.8.5, which will be
bundled with QGIS, needs to be re-built after installing 4.8.6. This is
because the Mac bundling CMake scripts use the ID of a given Qt*.framework
as the search string in a find/replace function when bundling to ensure the
links are bundle-relative. Unfortunately, until recompiled, the supporting
libs do not have the same link path, so it all just fails. [0,1]

Supporting affected libs include: PyQt4, QScintilla2, Qwt, OsgEarth(Qt
parts), and QwtPolar

There is still something funky with the osg/osgearth frameworks or libs,
which I will rebuild next week. In the meantime, the nightly should work
except for the Globe plugin, which now does not load properly, then causes
a crash on exit.

Thanks again for reporting.

Hi
This morning we have been talking about recording and calculating movement pattern in 3D.
Movement over time. And then I need a buffer in 3 dimension. It is not visualization  - just the calculation ? and then later an overlap analyze. Can this be done I QGIS, PostGIS ?

Qgis no. PostGIS yes. PostGIS 2.0 has 3d support.

It is loading fine with Larry?s new version.

Except that the psycopg2 python library is missing from the bundle. Processing (at least) is needing it to load.

is a possibility, then we need a 940x240 pixels image to put in there.
If somebody takes the lead in this, I'm happy to put it in the carousel.

Yep, that is where now are the OSGEO/FOSS4G images are.
is Lene's text ok?

"We need testpersons for the next version -  Install the latest version
- new every week. Report issues at xxxx mailinglist/Bugreport"

Here's one: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/42637169/qgisorg_banner.png

The text could be: Get the release candidate for Windows
(http://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/?C=M;O=D), Ubuntu
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#qgis-testing), Mac
(http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html#qgis-macos-testing),
and more (http://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html) and
report any issue you find
(http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index#bugs-features-and-issues.html).

Best wishes,
Anita

Subject: [Qgis-developer] libspatialindex.so.1
Message-ID: <EAFEE600-139E-42A4-907C-5CC01EBD1C12@westnet.com.au>

Hi,

I've just made it though a source compile of master on linuxmint 17 RC (cf ubuntu 14.04). I didn't get am make errors, but when I attempt to run the result I'm told:
"error while loading shared libraries: libspatialindex.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory"

I know that ccmake found libspatialindex.so, but I'm guessing that's not the same thing.

Would someone be kind enough to give me some pointers?

Hello,

I think you should create a wiki page using old one as a template to give more 
detail on your project: when, where, etc.

And then send your proposal to the PSC list as a formal request.

Ok, it's on the frontpage (currently building)...

Also the po/source files are newly pushed to transifex, so people can
translate all new strings from the website.

	revision code b59a01c
Message-ID: <CAM+zXj3i3Uy=y=q5hiZY6EPoDMUAK0udiDzmTUj_Y1Q6wEvmSw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

i'm testing the qgis 2.3.0 revision code b59a01c

SO: Windows 7 64-bits
OSGeo4W 32-bits Installer

The steps that i've do:

1.? Create a empty polygon shapefile with three dummy fields (integer,
string, decimal)

2.? Press the edition button, the press the add new element;

3.? Draw the element then when click with right button of mouse the dialog
appear and then the OK button don't let me validate the new element.

Anyone have this behaviour?

Best regards
Jo?o

Hi Leyan

QgsGeometry::lineContainedInLine and QgsGeometry::pointContainedInLine 
are two other places using tolerances that might be a problem at large 
scales.
Sounds resonable to me to restrict the zoom level at a point where it 
cannot be supported anymore. Don't know if there is any application out 
there using scales beyond 1000:1.

Regards,
Marco

Hi,

In PostGIS 2.1, you have some 3D analysis operations provided by the
SFCGAL library (www.sfcgal.org).
The 3D buffer is present in SFCGAL (3D minkowski sum), but not yet
exposed to PostGIS.

Hi all.
I believe the new panel could be improved:
*instead of two buttons (Expand tree+Collapse tree) a single toggling (on/off)button
could be better
* the full stop at the end should be removed
* the Expand/Collapse button(s) should be removed or greyed when in table or graph mode
* the heading of the popup should not read "qgis.bin" but somethign more appropriate
(e.g. the name of the layer).
Thanks!

Ok,



*I don't think to SFCGAL.*

*It required a special recompile of postig so I usually don't use it.*

Thanks Yves!

We definitly have weird things, the query send by QGIS to define the cursor
is malformed, (no * in select, no commas between fields..)
In addition, we see several errors that should not exist. Qgis always
queries the style definition tbale even if it does not exists. QGis should
test for that table on connection. 

We keep lmooking what happens. My problem is that it happens on other tables
too. 

R?gis

little update. We now reproduce the problem. It disappear when dropping the
primary key. 
Yves, the DDL I gave you didn't have a PK, could you add one on id_anomlie
field and test?

Hi all,

I'm looking for assistance in tracking down an issue some users are
experiencing in the map composer, where after some time items are no
longer selectable. I'm unable to reproduce this issue and consequently
it's very difficult to debug.

Has anyone else experienced this? And if, so, can you share details of
your build, platform and composition details?

See

Subject: [Qgis-developer] WFS provider without cache broken
Message-ID: <53835643.9050509@oslandia.com>

Hi,

The WFS data provider seems broken when not-cached. As far I can see 
QgsWFSProvider::getFeatures( const QgsFeatureRequest& request ) is never 
called, and it's where the special case of uri with BBOX (i.e. 
non-cached) is dealt with.

The feature request from the vector layer goes through 
QgsWFSFeatureSource where cached features are stored. I think that a big 
part of the code in QgsWFSProvider should go in QgsWFSFeatureSource in 
order to cleanly fix the problem.

Can I have a second opinion on that before working on in this direction ?

Thanks,

VM.

PS: I updated https://hub.qgis.org/issues/9444

Message-ID: <E388BD69181521479812E5991580D11E0ECD9B@S-MILE2.bafg.de>

On our institutes SLES 11 SP3 server I have set up a software environment with most of the open source GIS software available at the moment using "Environment Modules". With a bit of tweaking I got everything to install and run nicely, but with the Qgis mapserver I'm struggeling at the moment. Through zypper I have installed the packages "FastCGI" and "FastCGI-devel" system-wide and QGis 2.2 compiles and installs nicely from sources.

Generally I have been following these descriptions:
http://linfiniti.com/2010/08/qgis-mapserver-a-wms-server-for-the-masses/
http://hub.qgis.org/projects/quantum-gis/wiki/QGIS_Server_Tutorial

I have created a "gis" directory in /srv/www/cgi-bin/, copied a .qgs-file and the qgis_mapserv.fcgi binary to this folder and changed the general settings of apache. When running the browser with "http://localhost/cgi-bin/gis/qgis_mapserv.fcgi?", I get the following reply:

***********************************************************
Server error!

The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request.

Error message:
Premature end of script headers: qgis_mapserv.fcgi

If you think this is a server error, please contact the webmaster.
Error 500

************************************************************

In the meantime I have recompiled QGis, tried a variety of settings of the apache server, but can't find a solution to my problem. Can anybody give me a hint on my potential mistakes? Are there any apache settings to be changed or is the problem QGis-related as the reply suggests?

Hi Michael

At the moment, the compression rate is left to the Qt library both for 
png and jpeg (-1 is given to QImage::save). I agree it will be usefull 
to change from client or from project.

 >Why not
 >FORMAT=image%2Fjpeg%3B compression%3D90
 >I guess it is not standard ?

The problem here is that there has to be a new parameter for each 
compression rate. It might be better to have the possibility to 
configure the image quality in the project or by giving an optional 
parameter for the image quality (0-100 as the Qt parameter). So if the 
parameter is not there, the project setting is used. And if the setting 
is not set, -1 is used as it is now.

Regards,
Marco

As a first guess is that maybe the server cannot find all the libraries. 
Could you try to run the server on command line first (also as web 
server user) and see if it crashes already there?

Hi Marco,

Thanks for the reply

I created an issue : http://hub.qgis.org/issues/10361

I agree with you that a parameter per project is enough.

Thank you very much for this hint!

I finally changed /etc/apache2/default-server.conf and changed the "cgi-bin" settings to include all my "optional" libraries from the "Environment Modules".

<Directory "/srv/www/cgi-bin">
        AllowOverride None
        Options +ExecCGI -MultiViews +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        # for QGis mapserver
        SetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /opt/qgis-2.2-svn/lib:/opt/expat-2.1.0/lib:/opt/qwtpolar-1.1.0/lib:/opt/qwt-6.0.2/lib:/opt/qt-4.8.5/lib:/opt/bison-3.0.2/lib:/opt/postgresql-9.2.8/lib:/opt/gdal-1.11.0/lib:/opt/libxml2-2.9.0/lib:/opt/oracle-instantclient-11.2:/opt/FileGDB_API-1.3/lib:/opt/libkml-1.3.0-svn/lib:/opt/openjpeg-2.0.0-svn/lib:/opt/libgeotiff-1.4.0/lib:/opt/libtiff-4.0.3/lib:/opt/libpng-1.6.10/lib:/opt/zlib-1.2.8/lib:/opt/geos-3.4.2/lib:/opt/proj-4.8.0/lib:/opt/Python-2.7.6/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/lib64:/lib:/lib64:/opt/intel/fce/10.1.015/lib
</Directory>

With these additional libraries everything works nicely.

True. I guess I must have broken that while implementing support for MTR :-/

Not sure what do you mean by 'big part of the code' but I guess you
are referring to the routines that download WFS data and transform
them to a map of features. Currently the 'feature source' classes in
all providers are merely meant as a pure storage of information needed
for iterating, with no logic inside, and they are typically deleted
when iterators are closed. Because of that I would suggest moving any
logic regarding data retrieval to wfs feature iterator implementation.
In any case that code should not be in provider class.

"pk_masse_eau_anomalie" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id_anomalie)

no change on my side!

I can't add new feature (form shows only input filed disabled).

OK, we have the problem each time we have a int primary key on a table, but
only in our production database. (pgpool2 + 2 pg replicating). dropping the
constraint restore normal behaviour.... 

We are dumping the prod and restoring it in a new instance to check what
happens. 

In QGIS provider code, it seems that primary key is not recognized (and it
doesn't appear in connection string on qgis side). In that case, the
delimiter between field is not set , and query set in cursor for attribute
table or identify is like "Select myfield1::text myfield2::integer from
mytable". The query is malformed so the cursor fails and qgis tries another
cursor infinitly. We couldn't find what is different between test database
and production database that could explain why QGIS can't interpret that the
same way.

Dear lists,

I'm happy to present my new plugin called "LayerBender".

It's purpose is to allow to align/distort vector layers to match a source,
very much like georefencer does for raster. It seems ArcGIS and OpenJump
call this feature "Rubber sheeting".

Demonstration video : https://vimeo.com/96142479

I needed this in a project I'm working on to align some already digitized
historical maps.

Please note that the plugin is still experimental and not much tested yet
(and only under windows)... So please be understanding in case of problems !

All feedback is welcome, either here or on
https://github.com/olivierdalang/VectorBender

Hope you like it !

Best,

Olivier

Hi Olivier,

cool feature! Is it related to
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/vectGeoref/  (vector georeferencing plugin)?

have to check both myself off course, but just wanted to make you aware
of it.

Hi Olivier,

Once more, you did a really great job!

I just wonder about the technique when you have enough points (>7).
In case of mathcing old to new plans, isn't it better to do an affine 
transformation (scale, translation and rotation) using least-squares 
rather than doing a triangulation?
You might have better visual results with the triangulation, but the 
affine would lead to more coherent results.

Cheers,

Denis

Does not seem to happen here. I can see that layer name gets into
editing state, but immediately after opening the properties dialog the
editor is closed again.

I guess we can just go back to the original behaviour without the
"SelectedClicked" edit trigger. Probably not worth some additional
hacks to keep this feature alive. And then there is still F2 for quick
renaming...

AFAIK vectGeoRef does an affine transformation.
It would be great if the two tools would merge into a single plugin,
bringing thir different solutions.

Agreed, that precises what I had in mind. Thanks.

I'll work from that and propose a design.

Hi,

We would definitely need this functionality for our application modules
- we need functions like "min", "max", "mean", "sum", "average" to work
on 1:n relations.

Now that we have relations in QGIS, I think that aggregate functions are
a logical next step. Something to seriously consider in 2.6.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [OSM importer] Spatialite InitSpatialMetadata
	without (1) yet
Message-ID: <CAB4g1=xLEeAaK+AzqgGEHn+QN58-tUM0ZkHxYixN0mWaAZtmFw@mail.gmail.com>

Some months ago I opened a ticket about this [1]. I see that
InitSpatialMetadata is still called without the parameter, which makes it
being attached to a transaction. It is veeeeeeery slow on Windows, because
of the Spatialite version. Will the next 2.4 have an updated Spatialite (>
4.1), which will prevent it from running inside a transaction?

Hi !

It's a shame, I didn't know about vectGeoref !!! (it seems it was released
only a few days ago)

Both plugin indeed aim to do the same... I'll see directly with Giuliano if
there's a possible merge !

Bests,

Olivier

Hi Denis,

The old-to-new plans scenario I was talking about is with very old maps,
which have strong deformations (actually mapping errors).

But still, I like the idea of being able to stick to a simpler
transformation even with more points, least-squaring the points.

The main difference is that allowing this would also lead to results where
the entered points do not perfectly match after the transformation, making
the "transform pairs to pin" option unusable, which won't be easy to deal
with from and UI point of view...

I'll keep it in mind though !

Thanks for the feedback !!

Olivier

Thank you for your attention to my work but I have nothing to teach

I am still available for any need, so that I can improve my knowledge

As already stated before, I am worrying about current developments around a 
lot of features looking like database features :
* Table joins
* relations
* "SQL-like" processing
* .. including aggregates

Implementing all these features on top of QGIS seems reinventing the wheel, 
and database wheels are particularly hard to design and implement well.
I really think we should re-study the global design of such features to have a 
clear and clean strategy instead of stacking features on features, lacking 
coherency.

As stated by Regis, basing this work on top of SQLite may be the best option, 
but more study has to be done and a general agreement is needed to go this 
way.

I have plans to implement this. Exposing QGIS layers as SQlite virtual
tables. This would give a lot of query bang with low code change   It was
done in OGR and works really well, of course it sucks with performance if
you do something really complicated but otherwise it would give QGIS a good
edge - if you need more power then more to a better database. A basic
query-everything type system.  This is something that MapInfo had and is a
bit of pain to loose when coming to QGIS.

I hope to start work after 2.4 is out.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673SWjmywmE1=5BX_Cbfd0Pm-GxZGyWKRQmdMTjH4uqkww@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've added a few small new features to QWC, currently they are in
Customizations.js because I'm unsure if they can be of general interest, if
yes, I would be happy to share and merge them upstream to QWC:

* center/zoom map on QWC load, for example:
?zoom=12&center=8.24,44.99&srid=4326  will center the map and zoom, an
optional "layers" parameter can be used to activate (show) the specified
layers.

* center/zoom to a feature, for example:
?searchtable=Numeri%20Civici&searchcolumn=gid&searchvalue=18247&zoom=11

this will search into layer named Numeri%20Civici for feature with
gid=18247 and zoom/highlight to feature if found, this function uses a
slightly modified version  of search_geom.php, for security reasons, only
layers configured to be searchable in config.php are enabled.

Hmmm I wasn't aware of this limitation in SQLITE views :(

I've added some lines on the wiki about this :
http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/virtual_layers

The challenge is to integrate it cleaning more or less transparently for
the end-user and without loosing performances.
If we want end-users to only manipulate GUI dialogs and QgsExpressions
at the maximum and let more advanced users tweak the corresponding SQL
clauses, then we probably have to convert from QgsExpressions to SQL ...

Is SQLITE's virtual tables the right target ? Well ... I am not aware of
any other way to embed an SQL parsing/planner/executor. We do not want
to reimplement our own database engine.
So, in my opinion, we would have to deal with SQLite/Spatialite
limitations. If users want more, they have to install PostgreSQL/PostGIS
and convert their data.

And about Giovanni's first concern, SQLITE does not support WINDOW
functions. There might be some ways to mimick by accessing ROWID though

Agreed.

In addition to the features mentioned above, I believe also indexing
and caching of vector data could be handled by SQLite, so it would be
good to keep that in mind during the design. Finally, the "memory"
provider could be implemented on top of in-memory SQLite table, too.

Martin

Yes, SQLITE does dynamic typing, so user or provider has to scan values to
guess the right type.

I agree with all of you about not reinventing the wheel and, yes, let's not
fragment QGIS' capabilities on data querying/filtering/etc.
My first idea was simply (but I'm not sure how much simple it is) to be
able to perform aggregate queries like in WINDOW functions. In my job it's
something I find very useful, and I would like not to have to export my
layers to a PostGIS DB just to do it.

Some basic examples:

 - get the average area of some polygon features
 - get the relative dimension against some other feature's dimensions
 - etc.

AFAIK these kind of queries cannot be run on Sqlite in one single shot.
This is why I wasn't thinking to Sqlite (or SQL anyway) to implement it,
but as an extension to expression engine, in a MapReduce pattern
perspective...

I agree totally.SQLITE could be a very powerfull basement to build user
oriented functions. But we need to be sure that it won't add *under the
hood* tricks. 

My first need here would be to be able to intersect two layers (Polygon X
Polygon ) and compute overlap ratios and unique relations of objects. 
I made a PGSQL procedure for that, and wish I could offer the same in QGIS
client, whatever datasource the user inputs. 
My latest tests converged to using processing python script, reading layers
in OGR and using Spatial SQL capacities for intersect and aggregate steps.
The hard part is how to get datasource definition from QGIS and make OGR
read it. The aggregate capacities of SQLite are easy to handle.  If we could
directly use qgis layers as OGR virtual layers, that would be sooo simple.

Hi,

have you tested the master version of QGIS Server with Qgis Web Client?

It seems that Qgis Server, for WMS GetCapabilities, doesn't write the
<SERVICE> section anymore (QGIS 2.0 did it), so this broke the Qgis
Web Client and cannot display map.

I've tested it on same project with QGIS 2.0 and master.

Hi all,

I understand your concerns, but on the other hand - how would you treat
all data sources equally well, if QGIS does not implement that stuff
within QGIS for data providers that do not implement this? One could
still write a QGIS expression to SQL compiler for those providers who
support these functions (Matthias Kuhn proposed that).

We will need these aggregate functions in forms for information purposes
and in the print composer for generating reports. Having to write
Postgis-Views would work for database pros. But let's not forget that
not all of our users are database professionals and not all of the users
have their data in Postgis.

Personally, I don't care where these aggregate functions are implemented
and executed, as long as they are easy to use and do not enforce the
usage of a specific data format.

Andreas

I totally agree Andreas.
Whatever the way it would be implemented, I hope it won't become a blank
textarea where to write some "special" SQL.
I imagine something integrated into the rest of expressions GUI.

Ok. Strange that type "afinity" is available for tables but not for views.

Anyway, the point here is to use SQLite and its virtual table feature as
a way to do SQL queries on any QGIS layer source.
In that particular case, original types of columns can be accessed
directly by the function used to expose QGIS layers as SQLite tables.

And if we need views on top of that, we can find some proprietary
representation, either on one side or the other (QGIS or a particular
table in SQLite).

Offering SQL machinery to any QGIS data source can be done by using
SQLite internally. And if we need to add some special constraints on the
SQLite schema for that, then it's not perfect, but it is not a big deal.
We would then have QGIS-enabled SQLite files (as Spatialite geometry
tables must have a correct row in geometry_columns and so on)

In the other hand, being able to use any features of any SQLite file as
a valid QGIS data source is a more difficult problem, I think.

Exactly.

But we have to discuss the technical details :)
What we've been building so far is some in-house implementation of a
partial database engine. And when we want to add more new powerful
features, then ... what we have is too limited.
So the idea is to use a "real" database engine to deal with everything
that is related to a database AND to be transparent for most of the
users. So yes, the objective, in my opinion is to keep existing GUI
parts and always have end-users in mind when adding a new feature (like
aggregation).

So yeah, the challenge is how to use SQLite as the underlying engine,
when the user inputs QgsExpressions or don't want to have anything to do
with SQLite (part of the answer should be to have an expression to SQL
converter, indeed)

Might also want to merge in the
https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qgsAffine/ which provides direct user
control over an affine transformation. Possibly as an alternate middle
step or a way to save the transformation parameters in case you want to
apply them in batch.

I was also thinking about filing a ticket to ask for vector to be added
to the core Georeferencer, since gdal 1.10 ogr2ogr can take a gcp list
and apply polynomial 1,2 or 3 to a vector and reproject it. So after the
previous mentioned mergers it would be good to see how the core
georeferencing tool could be enhanced by these slightly different
workflows and be allowed to do either vector or raster.

Thanks,
Alex

@Alex Mandel : I'd love to add ogr2ogr transformations in VectorBender. I
can imagine how to do it using temporary files and shell commands, but it's
probably the worst way to go... I'll look at it when I have a bit of time
(any help on this is of course welcome)

I'd also find it nice to unify all georeferencing tools under one UI. But
to me, the current georeferencer is a bit annoying to use (you always have
to move the window around, and can't use all the normal qgis tools on the
points pairs), still I don't believe the UI of VectorBender will convince
everyone neither...

Agreed. The raster georef is oldish, and would need some love. The rater+vector
unification would be a good chance for it.
All the best.

Right I was actually hoping you could make your method an option for
Rasters too. We should still retain the current window but it should be
optional to switch between the methods since there's are positives to
both ways of doing it. But I agree that it should be easier to dock the
window for side by side comparisons, or use your method where the
unreferenced image can be free floated next to the real data.

I expect for ogr2ogr that you can start with a wrapper the same way
gdaltools works. Long run of course it should be possible via the API to
use GDAL more directly.

Thanks,
Alex

It is desired that Rast__unopen_all() is not called before longjmp(),
I think. I don't want to close all maps successfully opened before.

It's not working in Processing right now (I've reported it to Victor).

I think I got it from Andre Joost's post
http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/93021

A little research shows as of gdal 1.10+ use can use this method.

Alex

Hi All,

As the responsible person for QGIS relations, I feel obliged to share my 
thoughts in this discussion.

First of all a few notes about QGIS expressions and their current state:
QGIS expressions are a nice and handy functionality to quickly calculate 
values based on a single feature in QGIS. This serves a lot of use-cases 
quick and easy. However, in their current state, they don't allow to do 
exactly what this thread originates from: aggregate and join data from 
other layers or use subqueries.

I like the idea of using sqlites virtual tables to have immediate access 
to a huge base of functionality offered by sqlite to do complex queries. 
If we introduce this support, we have immediate support for a wide range 
of database functionality with a few lines of code. The only thing I am 
not sure (and I don't know the virtual tables implementation enough to 
answer this question) is if it is able to delegate cross-table queries 
to the original database. In short: can I do a request that requires 
data from different tables of the same database and have it executed 
directly inside the database? My suspicion is no, because the sqlite 
virtual tables will be known to sqlite as QGIS tables and it will still 
query the tables through the QGIS provider, therefore calculating e.g. a 
max functionality by querying the QGIS provider for all features and 
then calculating the "max" locally and not on the server side. This 
would be a major performance impact for customers having a single 
database that could do this calculation for us instead of doing this 
ourselves.

Instead, if we have QGIS expressions (or a QGIS query implementation on 
top of it) support for this, we are able to tell, if different tables 
are from the same database and therefore if we are able to delegate the 
whole join/aggregate/subquery whatever job to the database and let the 
database do what it's good at.

Therefore my question to the folks who know the sqlite virtual table 
code: is it possible to have sqlite virtual tables forward cross table 
queries to the database itself? Or is it possible to get access to the
parsed query tree (or whatever the name of that may be) to determine
based on QGIS side based on the parsed query if we are able to optimize
by forwarding to the database.

Concerning joins, merging this code with the relations seems a viable
option for me in the long run. Currently, relations do no caching and
do not "hard join" the data on the other table (meaning, joined fields
are not available as fields) and maybe there are other things missing
(I remember a thread here on the ML about this before)

Kind regards,
Matthias

Yes exactly. We have more or less the WHERE clause with expressions.
Aggregates, joins and subqueries could be built using something else
(relations?)

AFAIK, you do not have direct access to the query sent to a virtual
table. But the SQLite engine will ask your virtual table driver what is
the best way to resolve a constraint on columns.
For instance, if the original query has a WHERE 'a = 2', then the driver
will be asked if it knows how to quickly resolve this, using indexes
(have a look at xBestIndex at http://www.sqlite.org/vtab.html)
So I guess, you could use the remote database indexes.
But, yes that would still be not very efficient if you want to query two
tables of the same postgis database.

In my mind, SQLite virtual tables are interesting for offering a more or
less relational view on data sources that are not originally designed
for that. But it would be suboptimal for already powerful databases.

We then have two kinds of "database backends" : real databases (postgis
and ... what else ?), and pseudo-databases through SQLite virtual tables.

And we would have a conversion from QgsExpression + relations to
different dialects of SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL / ...) in each provider ?
Does it make sense for you ?

Yes in my opinion, we should try to have the same code for what we call
"joins" and more general relations. And on the GUI part, some
redundancies between these two concepts may have to be reduced as well.

Works. Can I hope the patch will find a way to 7.0.0?

Hi,
Still on this topic. I made a few tests with sqlite views.
Indeed you cannot enforce a particular column type, but :
* you can convert values with CAST (casting 'foobar' to integer gives
0), even if the resulting type is undefined
* QGIS does not seem to have any particular problem with untyped SQLite
columns, they will be reported as TEXT (QString) in the layer properties
* Even if the column is untyped, each value has its own type. So if a
column results from a CAST, to integer say, then the corresponding
attribute will be in a QVariant typed as an integer when it is fetched.
You can then use this value in a QgsExpression or a categorized
symbology as an integer.

Am I missing other use cases where not having a column type is a problem ?

Hello All,

Well, I've uploaded version 2.1 of plugin Transectizer. It fixes a little
issue about scrollbars and several minor GUI changes.

Please approve this new version if you consider it appropiate.

Now a question:

How to cite QGIS in a scientific paper?
How to cite plugins or, say so, is there any policy about this?

Best regards

Message-ID: <53860140.1090200@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
I've been using Valmiera, but thought I'd give 2.3 a try.
Very impressed with the rendering, but one practical issue has come up:

I'm loading 1.17m polygons.
Part way through rendering, I recognise the area I want to zoom to, so I 
simply zoom right in (yay +1 for multi-threading).

Now comes the problem: How do I know when the rendering has fully completed?

I see a few of my polygons appear, then seemingly nothing happens for a 
good few seconds, and then another clump of polygons appear.
Until I have waited for a good while, do I start wondering is the 
rendering is still happening, or if I have holes in my data.

Is it possible to (perhaps) change the background colour of the word 
"render" in the bottom right corner to say red when a rendering thread 
is active, and then back to grey (or even green) when all rendering 
threads have completed?


Just a thought

Regards and well done.
Zoltan

Good news!
I couldn't achieve that with views in QGIS 1.8, all field cast to numeric
were converted in Qstrings.

Hi all

I just sent a pull request to allow configure the JPEG compression for
getMap requests :

* with a new configuration in the Project properties dialog / OWS Server /
WMS capabilities : this is used as a default value if found. If not found
(older QGIS), -1 is used as before
* with an optionnal request parameter IMAGE_QUALITY . If passed and valid,
it overrides the project configuration.

Please review and comment : https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/1403

Regards

Michael

Well relations would need to be integrated into some form of syntax 
first. And IMO this should be integrated nicely into the QgsExpression 
system to avoid having yet another candidate for this thread. The output 
of a relational query should be accepted as a node in a QgsExpression, 
and it should be able to insert a QgsExpression as part of this a 
relational query. So I think the best way is to extend expressions to 
support iterators (and maybe single features?) as return values. But I 
know that there are other opinions out there ;)

It does make sense.

Real Databases: PostgreSQL, Oracle, MSSQL, (sqlite, native SQL through OGR)

What would you like to use virtual tables drivers for?
The idea of having it available as another provider for layer 
definitions sounds good to me anyway.
But should it also be possible to use sqlite syntax wherever we have 
expression syntax integrated now?
Then the UI would be "Field / Expression / SQLite"?
In terms of control over what gets executed where and to translate it to 
native SQL wherever possible.
In terms of quickly available functionality, sqlite virtual tables are 
most likely an easy shot. Is there a possibility to overcome the problem 
of "control"? Would be nice if yes, but I don't know the people behind 
sqlite.

Is it worth adding two different syntaxes that may and will confuse 
users for their advantages? In terms of usability I doubt that it is a 
good idea (Apple would immediately fire any CTO who proposes having this 
redundancy, but then, they have tons more development power than we have 
:-) )

Sure thing. My idea is to allow some more control in the relations 
window. For this purpose, I think a checkbox to "hard join" some fields 
(doesn't need to be all, does it?) should do the trick I think.

Then we can also replace the fields properties "Join" dialog with a 
"Relation" dialog that gives some control over relations that include 
the current layer, so a user doesn't always have to resort to the 
project properties.

Hi, 
the points Matthias raises are really good points:
- how much can we trust sqlite (the community doesn't seem too opened)? And
how stable library versions are (we've had many troubles with spatialite
versions)
- having redundant ways of doing the same thing is one of biggest criticism
of users here. An advanced user who knows each tool will know what to do. 

those risks explain why current tests are feasibility tests only. We need
those investigations to be aware of the limits of each possible approach.

Cheers
R?gis

How about querying the sqlite_master table to find the data type?  And why
not use the constraints found in this query to set up the qgis relations?

Hi Vincent,

Under a normal compiling of QGIS, the psycopg2 Python package is not
installed, and is required to be installed by the user/developer. This is
different than the stable QGIS installer bundles from Kyngchaos.com, which
have other supporting libs and Python packages bundled in. Likewise, there
are no extra supporting installs for the Processing plugin, e.g. GRASS,
OTB, etc..

Adding all the supporting libs/packages would make the nightly
upload/download much, much larger. Also, the nightly is meant to be basic
build output for compiling and bundling, as defined by the CMake variable:

QGIS_MACAPP_BUNDLE=2

If the supporting libs/packages are included in those CMake scripts [1],
then they are in the nightly, excepting instances where there are issues
building them or building against them with the latest master version.

I will add information to the nightly download website that indicates what
extras components need locally installed.

Kyngchaos.com has many of the required Python packages available as
installers [2].

AFAIK there should be no major problem with SQLite versions.

Agreed.

Using the foreign key constraints to propose automatically created 
relations to the user would be a nice feature for any database. One 
problem here is, that the providers handle the database management 
themselves and only provide QGIS the information that there is a layer, 
but not from what database it comes. Maybe it would be possible to 
extract this information with the current architecture but for an 
optimal handling the provider architecture should be adapted to provide 
such information in a standard way.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Menu File renamed to Project,
	but Toolbar is still called File
Message-ID: <53872334.8030206@duif.net>


Hi Devs,

on transifex a translator mentioned the fact that there is still a
'File' toolbar, while the MENU is renamed from file to Project

https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/qgis-documentation/translate/#fr/docs_training-manual_introduction_overview/23411708

Should we not be consequent in this, and also rename the toolbar to
'Project' (and even the code?)

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

In the same line of thought, I have realized today that right-clicking a
layer you will see the name "Filter..." to open the query builder, and in
layer menu its called "query...".

In my opinion, "filter..." seems more accurate to what the functionality is
used for does.

Best regards,

Hi Tim,

We, at Camptocamp, would surely be willing to take over maintainership of
ftools. So thanks for suggesting this.

Not being familiar with all the community processes, I am wondering what
would be the next step. Should we have approval form the PSC ?

Best regards,

Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg94nu=HUuKan1=3r78OZzY24MVPsNDqB9u7Cj+T0vqXQg@mail.gmail.com>

Here is the way I currently see it.

Currently there is no really easy way to do cross layer queries. Lets
assume that the layers are not database based, which a lot of time they are
not, or are mixed data sources, which I deal with a lot. Currently your
only option (if you want to do query type stuff) is to upload everything to
a database format and run a query there but even that experience is broken,
or not an option.  Using SQLIte virtual tables here IMO would gives us a
nice quick high level query that we can run on any layer open in QGIS to
get some results.  Of course there needs to be some information warning the
user that there are limitations and if you run it on a large data set while
trying to do something complicated you are going to get crap performance,
however for the simple case of something like: SELECT cola,
buffer(geometry) FROM layer WHERE ID > 10, this would be fine and we could
just return a new layer with geom and cola.

Using SQLite here means we can be layer agnostic at the higher level. This
would also solve one of my longer standing issue of extracting just the
columns you need, currently this is a really painful process. With a query
model we just run query -> export like normal.

When it comes to QgsExpression translation to native query language, I
don't see any direct problem with this, in fact Martin designed
QgsExpression so we can just attach node visitors to the tree and do what
we need.  Each provider would just have their own expression tree visitor
class and do what it needs with each node in the tree.   The main problem
with this can come with translation when something doesn't quite match up,
or isn't supported, in which case you would just need to bail and run it in
QGIS.

My other idea is to allow the data providers to run a native query on the
connection/database and just return the result as a new layer.  This would
be a matter just passing a query string, running the query on the provider,
returning a new layer with the data.   The layers don't need to be opened
in QGIS.  Pretty much what DB Manager currently does but done at a provider
level, so we have it for each provider.

In my mind there are two ways here for running queries:

1) SQLite over open layers in QGIS
2) Data provider query

The query dialog would have both options and the user can pick which one
they want to do.  If you select SQLite then you get the warning about
performance, if you use the provider then you can select which provider and
connection to use.  This should just reuse the connections you already have
defined in the browser.

This is the general idea (stolen from OpenJUMP):

Nathan

Message-ID: <CAALdH9U_bq1-Z0p19gzw=ZxAoMjfNYRnJQYDWb+o4EMrd8M_kQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I'm trying QGIS from standalone installer 2.3.0-21 64bit (Win 8) and at the
start I'm getting  a message error related to the MetaSearch plugin, that
doesn't find the pytz module.
Is this a known issue?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Share some of my Processing Scripts
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6x6uVff7+Ev+MXLoCNd_LLM-JX9RyPsh5X7WR31uDFYw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi QGIS users and devs,

I would like to share the Processing scripts I have created this last 2
months. Here is the list :

Database
=========

* Create vector layer from PostGIS table : fill the database connection
parameters, choose a table and an optionnal WHERE clause, and get the
result as a vector layer

* Create vector layer from SQL Query : Choose the database type (PostGIS or
Spatialite), write the query and get the data as a vector layer

Raster
======

* Define 1 raster layer properties : set style from optionnal QML, set the
layer CRS, refresh contrast enhancement and save properties as default style

* Define multiple raster layers properties : the same as above for more
than one raster layer

String
=======

* Read file content into string : Read a text file and output a string with
the file content  (usefull to run some queries)

Another of my script is already in Processing Example script and allows to
search and replace values by another . This could be handy with the one
above to run parametric queries.

Vector
========

* Define 1 vector layer properties : select and apply a QML (optional), set
layer CRS, create spatial index, recalculate extent, set title and
abstract, save properties as default style -  all in once.

* Define multiple vector layers properties : same as above but for multiple
vector layers (without title and abstract inputs)

* Save features filtered by expression : Choose a vector layer, use and
expression to save the matching features as a new vector layer

* Select vector features by expression : Use an expression to select the
vector layer matching features

* Square grid from layer extent : choose a vector layer and a grid cell
size and outputs a vector grid.


All the scripts are on Github ( GPL2 licence).
https://github.com/3liz/QgisProcessingScripts

I documented each script with the Processing help feature.

Any feedback welcome !

Cheers
Michael

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=w0TiOKATJ4wwAaa3aLTCm8S-+2_WqH+S8CWJRppyj9_g@mail.gmail.com>

I've implemented the option to break lines when a new line intersects
existing lines on the same layer.
I've added the option to the "snapping options" dialog. Having the "avoid
intersections" option for polygons, I've added a new column to define the
different meanings of the checkbox, in case it's a line layer or a polygon
layer. See the image:

Is it ok to add the option over there?

No, at least in my case the MetaSearch module bundled with the installer
doesn't start correctly and is then signalled as corrupted, due to lack of
 the pytz dependency. I've tried unistalling and then reinstalling QGis
2.3, same situation.
The other pre-installed Python plugins in apps\qgis-dev\python\plugins
(fTools, etc.) seem to have no problem.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Failed to merge geometries
Message-ID: <1401476947548-5143328.post@n6.nabble.com>

Dear Community: 
We have been working more than one year  with this excellent GIS tool and I
have seen so much potential in it. I have a small problem that I would like
to share with you to see if you can help. 
Curiously, the merge tool(combines selected features of advanced scanning
bar) does not work very well. Supposedly this tool applies to two adjacent
polygons , it should give a result of the  geometry and for the  theme
attributes, this provides a window where you can select the attributes that
will stay with the geometry either polygon A or B .In this last part is 
where the problem lies independently the option that  we choose to create
the new geometry this always appear without the attributes table. 

Extra information: 
Version 2.2.0 Qgis Vamiera 
OSWindows 7 64-bit 
Vector Layer: Shapefile and Postgres table 

Thanks for your cooperation

I have patched my relbr7 locally on the AIX supercomputer and it compiles.

I should have added that I use gcc there. The change should be tested
with compilers as well.

Hi !

Great thread :-)

Just a thought : if we are able to load shapefiles and other non-db formats
through spatialite, is there a point in still being able to load them the
old way ? Won't this just cause confusion, and force us to maintain an
artificial and less powerful query language ?

And what about database data providers, couldn't we load all of them
through spatialite's virtual ogr, so to allow an unified and full featured
spatial query language on ALL layers ? Wouldn't this also open the door for
caching data of distant servers ?

How cool it would be to be able to create real cross table views with
functions such as buffer, intersect, etc. !!! (without having to import all
data to a database first, which is indeed a real combo-breaker)

(sorry if I missed the point, I almost know nothing about how data
providers work in QGIS)

Best,

Olivier

;) This is what we are talking about.  Loading any QGIS layer using
SQLlite/Spatialite thought virtual tables.

I?ve also some scripts that may be of general use (in addition to the ones for road and transit analysis that I intend to embed in a provider) :

- Contour : make contours around points at levels (based on the contour plugin)
- Buffer contour : make and merge circular buffer around points at levels
- Points at crossing / touching lines : make a point layer where lines cross or touch each other (2 scripts)
- Fill holes : remove holes in polygons under a certain area
- Remove parts : delete parts in multi polygons under a certain area
- cut by field : cut one polygon layer by another when 2 polygons share a field value


They are under the extra script folder at my git repository : https://github.com/chourmo/QGIS-Transit-tools.git

Nice! Can you remove the abbreviation and change the text to say simply
"Split intersecting lines" (using 'spilt' will be more consistent with
other digitising tools and sounds less negative than break which sounds
like something gets damaged).
