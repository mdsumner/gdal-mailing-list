Painlessly? Unfortunately not.

Some manual code tweaking is often required, see here for examples:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] getting list of available QgsComposer
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yuYgf1ywr6U7oUyThiX_EB8tu+aWVL3Qp9TViUkAkC=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Can anyone tell me how to get the list of the current composers in a project?

there is a activeCompositions() method in the QgsInterface class, but
it returns a list of QgsComposerView. The problem with that is that
those views do not seem to have a name (the constructor of the class
actually gets a name, but it is not used...)

I need the name to list the composers as part of a plugin, so I guess
i would need the QgsComposer object instead. I could just get the name
from the menu items, but I am sure there must be a cleaner solution...

There seems to be a printComposers() method in the QgisApp class...but
that class is not available from Python.

Any idea?

Thanks in advance!

That's the best current approach, but unfortunately it's pretty ugly.
With the layouts rewrite I'm hoping to fix this by having a composer
registry attached to the project and moving the name of a composition
to sit as a property within the composition itself.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Python 3 migration plan - what we can do to help
	people.
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg-39oe+YMzrMSW5187rTeAVZiOq0nNJ_GXVgDuO0F+Y2w@mail.gmail.com>

Note: This is just a email to talk about what we can do to help people move
not about when we should move to Python 3. I don't want to repeat what
happened in the SIP version change.

Hey all,

So today I was at PyCon AU and talked to a few of the core Python devs.
One of them talked about a tool they are going to use on PyPi so that it is
going to (at some stage) start rejecting uploads of Python 2.x **only**
code.  There is some code in 2.X that just doesn't work in 3.X however
there is a common sub set that can work no issues when ported.  The plan
for PyPi is to just reject code that can't be auto run on 3.X to bring
people onto a common base that can be ported easily.

I thought this might not be a bad thing for us to start doing on the plugin
upload site, not so much reject, but just warn about things that are 2.7.
We could just have something that says "This stuff is Python 2.7 and when
we move to Python 3.X it's not going to auto port and will need work"

How do people feel about that idea?

Just to rehash: This isn't saying to reject Python 2.7 only code yet, only
to warn about the stuff that will not port right away so people can plan
for it.  People could use this to create tickets to fix their plugins when
we do port.

Thoughts?

Hi,

just concerned about security if the code scanner/checker has to load
(untrusted) python code, but the PyPi people have probably already solved
this issue.

Any link to their solution?

Subject: [MetaCRS] Common SQLite-based dictionaries
Date: Sunday 02 August 2015, 08:15:12
From: Howard Butler <howard at hobu.co>
To: metacrs at lists.osgeo.org

All,

libgeotiff and GDAL all use a system of bespoke CSV files for their coordinate 
system dictionaries. proj.4 uses derived dictionaries made from GDAL's. Each 
is a slightly different subset and/or mix of the EPSG db along with other 
catalogs, customizations, and overrides. The situation is messy, fragile, and 
incomplete, especially for folks like me, who are interested in support of 
ever more complex systems of horizontal and vertical datums, time epochs 
associated with them, and direct transformation.

There have been multiple attempts to build a C tribe API that handles the 
coordinate system description problem, but all have failed for various 
reasons.The one true library to rule them all is probably a pipe dream, but 
maybe it is possible to collaborate in a slightly messier way -- at the 
dictionary level.

One significant technology that was not widely available when GDAL, proj.4, and 
libgeotiff all originated is SQLite. The idea of a single file, sql'able 
database is a standard assumption in today's software, especially in things 
like HTML5 (wars between WebSQL and IndexedDB), just about every significant 
phone application, and your favorite OGC super format [1]. 

I'd like to propose an attempt to standardize the GDAL, proj.4, and libgeotiff 
SRS coordinate system handling dictionaries on a SQLite database that starts 
with EPSG, with each project adding its own auxiliary tables as necessary. I 
am writing this message to MetaCRS to see if there is support for such an 
effort, and to determine if there are other related projects who would like to 
collaborate at this level. 

For the GDAL stack, the benefits of this approach are significant. Multiply-
defined, potentially conflicting definitions no longer need to be resolved. The 
dictionaries could release on their own schedule, rather than with each 
individual project. Powerful new functionality would be much closer to 
software developers instead of hidden behind a rather opaque and fragile CSV 
dictionary generating process. Mundane but important details like 
multithreaded access get handed off to a library and project who do that stuff 
all the time instead of one-off implementations inside of each individual 
project. 

Database views/queries could be standardized for common lookups across. 
Lookups would be faster due to indexed query access. Transformation 
validation, based on EPSG or other databases, could be provided across all 
three projects. More complex topics, like those described above, could be 
developed in a way that have impact across all three projects without tedious 
implementation. 

Consider this email a mix of 

1) is this a good idea? What other benefits do you see this approach providing?
2) Does your project want to collaborate on this?
3) Does this belong in MetaCRS?
4) What are the pitfalls that make this untenable?

windmill-tilting'ly yours,

Howard

Yes, that was what I was expecting to have, but couldn't find any
method to get it, so I assumed the composition was not storing the
name.

Ah but we're closer to finding a solution with all those details. It may
be fixable in Processing, which can be pushed to the plugin repo for
update any time.

Passing this along to devs who might have enough information now.

Thanks for taking care,

by the way: by copying the gdal algorithms from processing 2.10.1 to the  
2.9.3 folder (.qgis2/python/plugins/processing/algs/gdal), I gained access  
to the new GDAL dissolve polygons :)

Unfortunately, the model from before (GRASS6) didn't work anymore, and all  
attempts to adjust it via diff of a test model failed. So reworking my  
model (for the 10th time or so) in Ubuntu 2.8.3 from ubuntugis-ltr with  
working GRASS7, SAGA and everything and a partially upgraded Processing  
2.9.3

I'm on my way ... finally .. hopefully ...

Bernd

Does anyone else thing it might be good to have an official QGIS blog that
we can use to push out news to users?   Something with a RSS feed, etc
would be good.

So far, we've added it to the planet. We can also think about displaying
the post more prominently on QGIS.org and enable automatic sharing of posts
on our social media platforms.

Dear All,

I have build QGIS 2.8.2 in Visual Studio 2008. But I am getting following
error.

*Couldn't load PyQGIS.
Python support will be disabled.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "", line 1, in
  File "D:/QGIS/build/output/python\qgis\__init__.py", line 36, in
    from qgis.core import QgsFeature, QgsGeometry
  File "D:/QGIS/build/output/python\qgis\core\__init__.py", line 3, in
    from qgis._core import *
ImportError: dynamic module does not define init function (init_core)*

I am not able to understand why I am getting this error. Is this error in
the source code or did I miss anything in CMAKE-GUI window.

Can any one of you please help.

Thanks,
Azghar

Hey Anita,

That would be fantastic. Do you only have edit rights on there at the
moment?  I would be keen to write stuff for their in the future.

Hi all.
I have an issue with the plugin web app:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13175
I believe Alessandro is unavailable currently: is anyone available for a
look to it? This prevents me from approving several plugins, and I would
not like to make authors and user waiting too long.
All the best, and thanks.

Very good idea, thanks Nathan. Please consider that many, if not most,
of our plugin devs are relatively new devs, so any way of smoothing out
their path will be welcomed and important for an effective transition. I
would suggest adding to the warning you mention also a link to a
detailed howto.
All the best.

At the moment, the PSC members received invitations to become blog editors.
I think it's ok if you want to join. Let's see what the others think. I've
created a quick decision on

Hey Paolo,

100% that is what made me think of this when talking to the Python devs.
We should do as much as we can to help people get from A to B without
feeling lost.  Doing this in practice is a lot harder but I think we can
lean on tools made by others to help us here.

Hi Nyall,
thanks for raising this. We have been discussing about it several times
in the past, and never got round it mainly because of privacy concerns,
I believe. I'd be in favour of setting it up, of course asking consent
from the user during installation.
Do you have an idea of how difficult could it be?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS update available plugin and/or ping back
	plugin
Message-ID: <55BF24E9.8090307@duif.net>

In a separate thread, Neal raises the point below. Moving it to a
separate thread here.

Nyal asks: "... On a semi-related theme, we really need a core "QGIS
update available" plugin. I suspect there's a ton of users still on
2.8.0/.1/<2.8 just due to not knowing there's a new version out. This
could also be really handy for tracking stats of users..."

@Nyall: we already have an menu item: Help/Check QGIS version
But I just checked, and in 2.8.3 it says that I should update to 2.10,
so I think that is more or less broken since we do LTR versions...

And we did have this ping back discussion earlier, resulting in "we
cannot do it because of the privacy issues".

Though I'm pretty privacy-minded, I am actually in favour of a ping back!

Given the following plan, does that guarantee enough privacy for people
who were against it earlier:

- during first creation of .qgis2 user folder (upon first installation)
we generate some uuid (based on currentime+somerandom)
- upon later startups QGIS fires a HTTP GET request to a webserver which
contains this UUID + the language + current version used
- this request is handled by a separate apache or nginx server which
does nothing more then logging this, and returning the (for that branch)
latest version. Which is checked for by QGIS
- by simple analysing the logs (grepping) we can have some info about
our user-base (number of installs given a period of time) and even a
live 'currently QGISsing'-guess :-)

Can privacy concerning people live with this plan?

As an argument to allowing these pingbacks, as we/I invest pretty much
time in localisation around QGIS, it would make me feel better if I know
that all this work is actually be used by some people :-)

That's an issue, plus I don't think a passive check like this is
in-your-face enough for most users.

I'd also add platform details to that - just broad details like
operating system/linux distro, version and 32 or 64 bit. These stats
would be very useful to have.

First, an HTTP POST request seems more appropriate.

Please make this feature easy to disable in the build, we get quite a
number of bugreports in Debian about software that phones home, having
an easy option to disable it very helpful in that respect.

Repairing this feature, and maybe having an automated background check
at startup would be good for this feature.

Not me.

Any personal information sent by the user should only be done on a
volontary basis.

I would agree with this if :
* This is optional
* This is not activated by default
* The installer could ask the user if he wants to send statistics to the
QGIS project, with a list of data items sent.

User statistics are indeed very important. Privacy is just way more
important, especially in these troubled times. I do think we, as
opensource community members, and digital era citizens, have to show the
way. Do not ever do things users would consider evil without getting
their agreement.

Vincent

Which is actually the same as a pingback, except without an unique
identifier...
But I created an issue for the repair:

let's be honest: if you let ME opt out, I opt out....

We can already generate global figures based on downloads, or plugin
update requests...

Found out that access.log of plugins.qgis.org is not rotated, so some
grepping:

$ grep "/2014.*/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=" access.log | awk '{print $1}'
| sort | uniq | wc -l
541711

$ grep "/2015.*/plugins/plugins.xml?qgis=" access.log | awk '{print $1}'
| sort | uniq | wc -l
546017

so about half a million unique ip addresses per year? Not sure how this
makes up for:
- several installation behind one reverse proxy ip
- roaming users or dynamic ip addresses
But... it is something.

The advantage of adding little more uniqueness info is to get better
numbers. Making it an option, will not add something to our current setup.

As said, for me it is rewarding to see that we have a lot of users, or
that translations are actually used. But I do not want to end up in a
privacy flame war. If consensus is that privacy is more important, I
take that.

Richard

Hi all.
I also think point releases should be announced (just with a shorter
announcement, with less emphasis).
I'll be happy of taking care of this. I believe this should be done with
the same procedure as for the normal release announcements.
So, Juergen, should I do this from now on, or what do you prefer?
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.10.1 Pisa - Read CSV file problem
Message-ID: <55C09371.8000705@geograph.co.za>

Hi,
Using the above version on Win 7 64 bit, I read a CSV file (as 
attributes only) stipulating that "first record has field names"
Record 1 is as follows:
"SALnum","SALnam","1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10+"

When I open the attribute table, I see that fields 1 & 2 have names 
SALnum and SALnam, but the rest are called 'Field_3', 'Field_4' and so on.

When I edit record 1 of this CSV file to look like:
"SALnum","SALnam","1p","2p","3p","4p","5p","6p","7p","8p","9p","10+p"

The I get the correct field names (albeit 1p instead of just "1")

Is this an error, or is there some reason further down the line, that 
attribute tables cannot have 'numeric' field names?

Thanks and regards,
Zoltan

Hi Zoltan,

I wonder if this is a DBF format restriction. If I remember correctly 
DBF field names have to start with a letter followed by any combination 
of letters and numbers up to the maximum field name length.

Hi Frank,
Reasonable thought, thanks - but I named the 1p (not p1) and that worked.

Would be interesting to see what the author of the CSV import section of 
QGIS has to say.
Regards,
Zoltan

Hi Nathan,

If we can add a warning batch that points to possible problems... What
more can we want? Nice idea!

Does it do the checks on plain source code or does it need some runtime
information (so that e.g. only plugins with test suite can be checked
and only the parts covered by tests are checked)?

Cheers,
Matthias

Hey Matthias,

I'm not sure.  I will have to find the tool and do some testing.

Ability to perform the bookkeeping tasks needed in the position
Procedure for nominations
In order to nominate a person, please do the following:

Contact them first and obtain their agreement to be nominated - this is very important!
Fill out this form: http://goo.gl/forms/OfAiDPtMnA <http://goo.gl/forms/OfAiDPtMnA> (scroll down on that page for the actual form).
Closing date for nominations
The closing date for nominations will be Tuesday 11 August 2015.

Hi Zoltan

I think this could be classed as an error!  The source code rejects field names that look like positive numbers (some digits optionally followed by a period and some more digits).

I can't recall a reason why it should do this.  It could be reasonable to require field names to be compatible to database attribute names, but I can't see any need for that within QGIS itself.  This can go on a 'to-do' list to fix...

Cheers
Chris

	64 bit
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw1MP64q+GD10M72_h0AYZYY8KQfo9NS+v5SRedOx9397g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm encountering installation problems with the LTR version of QGIS.

While QGIS 2.8.2 installed fine, the QGIS 2.8.3 has these problems:

 - the start menu folder "QGIS Wien" is empty (no icons)

 - the BAT files are not generated after installation: in the
C:\Program Files\qgis\bin there are many templates like:
qgis-ltr.bat.tmpl

Could you check this?

There should be a postinstall.log file in the \qgis folder. The 
installation must have been broken before the bat and desktop icon creation.

Hi Denis,

Adding all features at once, or 1000 by 1000, speeds up enormously. It 
only takes a few minutes, at a steady speed of 480 fpm. Where adding the 
same dataset 1 by 1 took about 5 hours.

Thanks for pointing this out!

	wrong imports
Message-ID: <CAFFV8Fj9LQ60U7vmMcpfOVWXi-hke-B-Sy5adzvOBOOYt-LScA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There seems to be an issue with custom widgets in Python. For example this
plugin bug: ImportError: No module named qgsfieldcombobox (
https://github.com/informeren/qgis-cartogram/issues/2)

Compiling with
pyuic4 -o cartogram_dialog_base.py cartogram_dialog_base.ui
results in
from qgsfieldcombobox import QgsFieldComboBox
while it should be
from qgis.gui import QgsFieldComboBox

Is there some way to fix this on our side?

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi all,

in general I think we should advice to use the layer.addFeature() method
with a layer.commitChanges() in the end. It has the advantage that it
does batch updates on the provider automatically and proper signals are
sent so the UI (canvas, attribute table...) can reflect changes immediately.
The layer.dataProvider().addFeatures() method delegates all this to the
developer.

Cheers,
Matthias

So this is NOT a prerequisite. So feel free to nominate persons from any country. The only prerequisite we have for the QGIS.org <http://qgis.org/> formation is that one board member is from Swizterland - which is currently taken care of by the fact that we have Marco Hugentobler on the board.

Hi Chris,
Thanks for the opinion.
Do I log this as a bug?

Whilst I am quite happy to write a bash script to parse and alter my 500 
CSV files, I do feel that this is likely a more serious issue, as it 
will affect, I assume a lot of, users that load CSV files to join them 
to their spatial data.
Maybe the silence on this is because it either goes unnoticed, or there 
are many people just doing a work-around.

Let me know.

Thanks & regards,
Zoltan

Hi, 

In my opinion it is quite "special" to name columns with integer
numbers. Not what the average GIS user would do. In my own 2-decade GIS
career I never had such an issue. 

I am not against fixing this issue, but I don't think it is a serious
issue. We have many more important issues in QGIS.

Hi,
Fine - I did ask for an opinion, and I got one :-)

The CSV files are from South Africa's 2011 Census - as put out by 
StatsSA, and exported from SuperCROSS.
In this particular file, the numeric field names are for the "Age last 
birthday" of the occupant. (yep, from 0 to 120!!!)

So in short, I guess there are many, many users of this data - and for 
me an unnoticed error/deficiency, is still and error/deficiency.

Whilst I am not too perturbed because I can get around this issue, I 
figured it was my "civic" duty to raise it.

Cheers for now,
Zoltan

You need to have qgis lib in your python path.
On windows, that would be C:\OSGeo4W\apps\qgis-dev\python\qgis

To check this, just do "from qgis.gui import *" in python. If you don't 
have an error, then pyuic4 will work properly.

Best wishes,
Denis

?My point is that the plugin needs to work out of the box - and it doesn't.
Usually all paths are set correctly on Win in the OSGeo shell. Only in this
case there is an issue.

Well, how is compiled the UI file?
Usually, it is done prior to deployment using pyuic4

If pyuic4 was run without the proper python path, you won't have any 
error at compilation but the plugin won't work if it contains QGIS widgets.

Was pyuic4 run in an Osgeo shell?

?So the UI is compiled automatically when the plugin starts in QGIS.

Never used, I would think it would work directly.

But why not adding a new rule to the makefile to compile the ui?

Hi,
I think this should be reported. If there is no reason why a csv should not
have column fields name as numbers, then this is a bug, maybe a small bug,
but it's a feature that QGIS needs to handle.

The CSV files are from South Africa's 2011 Census - as put out by StatsSA,

why a csv should not have column fields named as numbers (shapefiles does
accept this kind of field name so joining csv like this might be allowed),
then this is a bug (or feature request?), maybe a small bug for some of us.
We don't all have same skills, what appears easy to handle for someone can
be a huge barrier for someone else. And as a community, we should make easy
the path for every one.
I know there are priorities but reporting an issue doesn't mean that it
should be fixed in the day. In QGIS Hub, you'll easily find reports that
are there for years. IMO, it's a feature that QGIS needs to handle. Report
it and if one day, someone finds enough time and skills to fix it, it'll be
done.

Regards,
DelazJ

by "you" do you mean Juergen, or myself?
I do not mind whichever way, I think we can reuse the standard
announcement, just stripping down useless parts.
All the best, and thanks.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.10 - weird black circles
Message-ID: <CAMKXKO6R8q_oZBFFTPHGx2siu8mPhgbMjfZm2vYspgiZx0ombA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

When playing around with projects from 2.8 to 2.10, some users reported me
they encounter weird rendering of their layers. Some black circles are
drawn on top of the layers, like in this image [1]

This happens for point or polygons, and for different method (
classification, single symbol, etc.).

I can manage sometime to get rid of these circles by opening/closing the
layer properties dialog, and checking on/off the layer in the legend.

Anyone has already seen this, and found a solution ? It seems to me it is
related to conversion of old project with 2.10, but I am not sure

Any help appreciated.

Micha?l

Check if diagrams are enabled on the problematic layers. There was/is(?) a
bug that enabled diagrams.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita,

This is it ! I will have to deactivate them for every layer ( looking which
is corresponding tag and boolean to set to False in the QGS file)

Thanks

Thank you Anita, after removing every diagram related tag from the qgs
file, everything works well, thank you! In my case it happened with a qgs
file which was saved in 2.10.1, and than after slight modifications it was
saved in 2.6.

Here is an example of a Makefile compiling ui files
https://github.com/3nids/quickfinder/blob/master/Makefile#L52

it's the line with pyuic4 which does the job!

As Anita pointed out, these are invalid diagrams.

They'll appear if you open a project which was saved in 2.10 in a version <
2.8.3.

Make files don't work very well on windows I would avoid them if you can.
Any reason the UI can't be loaded in code to avoid the build steps.

?Thanks Denis! I'll try that on Win later.

I'd still be interested if there is a solution to ensure that dynamic ui
loading on Win finds the right libraries for custom widgets.

Best wishes,
Anita?

Hi, 

Don't get me wrong. I am not against fixing it. I was just trying to put
it into perspective. Just because there is one dataset that has these
weird column names it doesn't mean the CSV import tool is broken. You
can just as well advise the StatsSA agency to improve their column names
into something more meaningful - e.g. age_10 - what if you want to join
the data later and you have again column names with numbers? What if
another person takes over the project and has no idea what the numbers
mean without a separate metadata description? What if you want to do
"Save AS" with such a layer and the data format prohibits columns named
with numbers? 

Anyway - its not good practice to name columns with numbers. In most
database you will have to escape such column names with quotes or it is
even forbidden. 

If you want to have it fixed you have the three options: 

- Fix it yourself in the code and provide a pull request
- Pay a developer to fix it to have it fixed in a short time frame
- File a feature request and wait until someone has the time to fix it

You can also use "Add Vector layer..." to load that csv (via OGR) and it'll
have the original field names (if they are quoted in the first line - like in
your example) and workaround that edge case.

Hi,

FYI we updated the certificates for
hub.qgis.org
plugins.qgis.org

While I was pretty sure we scored an A on
https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html

Now hub (on osgeo) scores a C, while plugins (qgis2) still scores an A...
both apache servers share the same config (but different versions of Apache)

I think we need to make a plan for migrating to a newer Debian/Trac
version...

Hi J?rgen,
Thanks for this - but this is not an issue for me, as I stated in my 
original post, I can work-around it.

I'll respond in slightly more detail for Andreas' post.

Hi Andreas,
I didn't get you wrong, your point on the smallness of this issue is 
quite valid, and I don't personally have a problem with this silent 
error, so I am just providing feedback.

I posted the issue because

 1. There are possibly users out there who have issues with this, but
    may not be brave enough to publicly state this as an error,
 2. Because as a user, I find it a responsibility to provide feedback
    when/if I see fit.
 3. I know there should be some pride in making QGIS as robust as
    possible, so may (some) devs want to know about the smaller issues.

So, I've logged it as a bug, and I am not putting in an invoice for my

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How qgis calculate the min/mx of floating point
	raster
Message-ID: <CABqTJk9aCb-b9nzEWyO-JCdsYMnMQfsgB-YmF7R0W1PdYZ77kw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I pot previously this question to the user ml, ma perhaps is more
for developer ml.

when I add a flot raster to qgis canvas, and see the starting property settings,
I see the qgis has populated the min/max for ever band.
But this vales are not corresponding with the results from
gdalinfo raster.tif

So I guess they are calculated with some algorithm.
Is this algorithm knowed ?

Or alternatively; whatis the right file where the min/max are
calculated , I could try some analyze on code to retrieve the
formulaes.

Thx,

A quick (but very relevant) note about GRASS7:

It seems that, in one of the latest changes, I unintentionally left
out a code line where GRASS was actually being called. I was getting a
bit crazy wondering where the error might be and why GRASS7 was not
working in the latest release....and finally found out that the reason
was that. So, in short, Processing was not running grass when running
a grass7 algorithm.

I have added that line back and it should be fine now.

If you can install the current master version, please test and let me
know if there are any issues or it is working correctly as before.

Regards

Is there any automated test for GRASS that might prevent this from
happening in the future ? If not, how hard would it be to add one ?

Hi,
can't we just reuse:

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2015-May/037717.html

we just have to update:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/final-2_8_1...final-2_8_2

with the new comparison.

All the best.

Are you sure it's the same config? It might be just a few extra ciphers
in the SSL config that should be disabled for known security reasons.
The SSL lab test usually tells you exactly why you scored low.

The new OSGeo6 machine is now operational. If you would like to provide
a docker instance, or want a fresh VM we can now accommodate. I'd think
it might also be good to load balance plugins requests that come from
QGIS across multiple servers to increase the reliability of getting and
checking plugins (2 frontends, 1 db, or just mirror some directories
where the plugin files are actually stored and not mirror any super
dynamic part).

Thanks,
Alex

Victor,

I edited the version of the processing plugin that i have installed (QGIS
2.8.3, processing 2.10.1) with the changes you made and now GRASS7 tools
work as they should, thanks!

Seems like you have not full write access to the folders.

Could you try again with the OSGOE4W setup / into a folder where you
have full access / as adminstrator?

Mmm, looking into the links from google one points to:

https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=AS:15169&client=googlechrome&hl=en-US

the only thing I can think of is that we have spam links in our wiki
pages (well, I'm pretty sure we had/have those)...

can that be the problem?

anybody else an idea?

Richard

We are very pleased to announce the point release of QGIS 2.8.3 'Wien'.  Wien
is German for 'Vienna' - host city to our developer meet up in November 2009
and again in March 2014.

As point release it contains no new features, but 150 changes to fix bugs (see
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/compare/final-2_8_2...final-2_8_3 for a full
list).

Even when only fixes are added to software they introduce the possibility of
new bugs - if you encounter any problems with this release, please file a
ticket on the QGIS Bug Tracker (http://hub.qgis.org/).  Please consult the
existing and closed issues there before filing any new ones.

The source code and binaries for Windows, Debian and Ubuntu are already
available via the large download link on our home page (http://qgis.org/).
More packages will follow as soon as the package maintainers finish their work.
Please revisit the page if your platform is not available yet.

Thanks

We would like to thank the developers, documenters, testers and all the many
folks out there who volunteer their time and effort (or fund people to do so).

From the QGIS community we hope you enjoy this release! If you wish to donate
time, money or otherwise get involved in making QGIS more awesome, please
wander along to http://qgis.org and lend a hand!

Dash is showing this too:

That's not even hosted by us...

Hi,

I don't know what the problem is

At 
https://www.google.com/safebrowsing/diagnostic?site=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.qgis.org%2Fpyqgis-cookbook%2F&client=googlechrome&hl=en-US

it says:

  * If you are the owner of this web site, you can request a review of
    your site using GoogleWebmaster Tools
    <http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/>. More information about
    the review process is available in Google'sWebmaster Help Center
    <http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=45432>.

So Richard - could you try to follow the Webmaster Tools link and see if 
we can get more information?

The other thing to check is if the very recent certificate updates maybe 
trigger this warning?

Andreas

Hi Zoltan

I've removed this constraint on field names from the QGIS code - this will apply in the next release of QGIS.  So no need to raise a bug.  If you do want to (or have other issues/feature requests) information about how to do so is at http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/index.html#bugs-features-and-issues.  Feedback from the user community is certainly encouraged.

Until the next release though you may have to write a script to deal with the files (or live with the replaced field names).

As to the silence - who knows!  Certainly this hasn't been raised to my knowledge, and the "feature" has been there a couple of years now.  I think if many users were affected this would have come up sooner, but great that you have raised it.

Cheers
Chris

Looking at the report I am correct, it's just some tweaks to be made to
the SSL config on apache. The newer sites don't have this issue because
the defaults on newer Debian versions are safer.

Hi Chris,
Good on you.
I logged it yesterday (#13187).
Do you get to mark it as "fixed"?
For the sake of a snail-trail, it's probably better than me just 
withdrawing it?

I completed the job I was doing, by parsing the csv files in bash (I 
moved the job over to my linux setup - I only use the Windows version 
for 'quickies'), so for now I am not in a hurry for this - but if I get 
another request for the job I was doing, I'll just pull the code and 
build it on my system.

Thanks again for seeing the bigger picture.

Regards,
Zoltan

Did that. Does NOT give any information...

It seems to have something to do with using httpS when visiting
https://www.qgis.org
because visiting
https://qgis.org is ok...

My quess is/was that we had/have spam links in our wiki, but as said,
Google gives you the possibility to list the tainted url's... but that
list is emtpy :-(

I've asked for a new 'review' now from Google. Which can take up 24

mmm, should not be the case, I think it is a coincident that Matthias
check/found this.

But I even reverted the certificate now (you should see that it is still
valid until 18-10-15), but according to Google we are still tainted...

Let's see what the which verdict is given by Google-UberMaster after
their review ...

Hi Richard, 

Thank you for dealing with this very annoying issue. It is easy to ruin
a good reputation, but not so easy to gain one. 

And it is especially annoying if such warnings to not provide enough
meaningful information to fix such warnings.

Nope, and has nothing to do with us either...

Hi all,

I need to add graphs generated by a plugin to compositions. I'm
considering to develop a PluginComposerItem in the same spirit as
PluginLayers, adding/removing a button in the toolbar when the plugin is
registered/removed.

Is that what was needed in your cases, or was a more general approach
required (like the qgis plugin mechanism, being able to access the
interface) ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] very slow on creating a new empty spatialite  db
Message-ID: <1438958591.6740.8.camel@pierluigi-Aspire-6930G>

Dear all,

I'm experiencing than when I create a new empty spatialite from qgis it
takes long time to do it.
Here belo is the code I tried:

---------------
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from qgis.core import *
import qgis.utils
from pyspatialite import dbapi2 as db
import timeit

start = timeit.default_timer()

dbase='/home/pierluigi/Scrivania/db.sqlite'
conn = db.connect(dbase)
cur = conn.cursor()

sql = 'SELECT InitSpatialMetadata()'
cur.execute(sql)
conn.commit()

stop = timeit.default_timer()
print stop - start
-----------

If i run this code my pc start swapping so much and to prepare the empty
db (the total variable) it takes 722.3559 sec or better ABOUT 12
MINUTES!!!

Of course the same is if I just save a layer into spatialite format.

Why is this happens?
Is there a work around for my code to speed up che db creation?

I'm running qgis on ubuntu 14.04, qgis 2.8 LTS from launchpad unstable
repo.

Thanks
Pierluigi

Hi Pierluigi,

InitSpatialMetadata() will insert about 5,000 rows into the
spatial_ref_sys table.
SQLite is a full ACID DBMS, so performing so many INSERTs
outside a TRANSACTION will certainly be a very slow operation.

solution #1:
-----------
sql = 'BEGIN; SELECT InitSpatialMetadata(); COMMIT;'

solution #2:
------------
sql = 'SELECT InitSpatialMetadata(1);'

both solutions have the same identical effect:
in the first case you'll explicitly define a Transaction
in your own SQL code.
in the second case by passing to InitSpatialMetadata()
a TRUE argument you'll authorize this function to silently
handle an internal Transaction.

bye Sandro

Ok, fully removed qgis website yesterday, and clean rebuild it after
removing references to raw.githusercontent.com...
Asked for a review..

This morning:

www.qgis.org should be ok now (but "As a result, we're removing the
malware warning from your site. This may take some time to happen".

www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook 'still infected' :-( (again NO hints, do
not know where to look for...)

Thanks Google... NOT

Just a warning that similar work is already underway - adding a composer
item type registry so that plugins can register their own custom item
types.

It's an extensive work though, because composer has a lot of hard coded
handling of all the existing item types (checkout all the item specific
methods in QgsComposition/QgsComposerView). That's why this work is tied up
with the layouts/reporting framework refactor.

Message-ID: <CAL5Q673vKKoJfoUMq6T7cUMyV7DHZFB+qPgd9MLtTZWn_GOYqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've just added a chapter about python plugins for QGIS Server to the
cookbook, I've also merged most of the informations available on the wiki
into the server chapter in the user manual.

The idea is continue to use the wiki for user-contributed informal material
such as:

* configuration examples
* tips and tricks
* user experiences / use cases

and use the manual as a reference with the complete list of supported
parameters (vendor etc.), env vars and installation instructions.

To avoid unnecessary duplication of informations, the reference material on
the wiki will be eventually removed.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS GRASS plugin - modules upgrade
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYqunEw+tDRS+3PA-KzaX=dXUCwTdJFf4nHy+BWscaE=pg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

the GRASS 7 plugin is enabled in QGIS master, but there are many
options which changed in GRASS 7 and has to be fixed in .qgm files.
Because some people already promised to help with the upgrade of
modules' configuration I want to ask them and everybody who is
interested, to start the upgrade of modules.  I have recently
implemented new functions in the plugin which will simplify your work.

How to upgrade the modules and contribute the changes to QGIS:

1) Install recent development version of QGIS (2.11, nightly build)

2) Fork QGIS  (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS) on GitHub, create a new
account first if you don't have GitHub account yet

3) Create a new branch in your fork, for example 'grass' [1], never
work in 'master' branch, master branch just keep in sync with original
QGIS master

4) Install git client on you computer (GitHub has its client for
Windows), clone your fork on your computer and switch to the branch
you created.

5) Start QGIS with GRASS 7 plugin, right click on a GRASS item in the
browser, open GRASS options and in Modules tab select custom
configuration and select the location of modules configuration in the
QGIS source code clone, for example, if you cloned the code to
c:/users/user1/qgis, select
c:/users/user1/qgis/src/plugins/grass/modules. Check the debug mode
option and confirm with OK.

6) Open a GRASS mapset by right click on the mapset in the browser and
select 'Open mapset' from context menu. You should now see in the
GRASS tools box under the three of modules the new debug bar with
three buttons: 'Reload tree', 'Run debug' and 'Close debug'. Click on
'Run debug', it will take a while because it runs each module to get
list of its options, as a result, you should see list of all errors in
the tree structure. There are currently 293 errors in GRASS 7 plugin.

7) Open a configuration file of the module you want to fix (in your
QGIS source code clone) in your favourite text (xml) editor and fix
the errors according to [2] and run debug again to verify if it is
really fixed. If possible (you have GRASS 6) start QGIS with GRASS 6
plugin and run also the debug to be sure that you have not broken
GRASS 6 options.

8) Once you upgrade bunch of modules, commit the changes to your
'grass' branch and push it to GitHub. Open that commit on GitHub and
create pull request [1] against the original QGIS master, let me know
and I'll merge it to master.

I hope that I haven't discouraged you, it may seem to be difficult but
it is quite easy in the end. You can also use the same system to
maintain your own set of modules for your or your organisation's
needs. Don't worry to ask if something is not clear or you find
difficulties.

Please let me know if you are still available to help as you promised
and if so, please agree on non overlapping branches in the modules
tree with others who will be working on the upgrade.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] PyQGIS - detect layers without geometry
Message-ID: <1439222406642-5219219.post@n6.nabble.com>

When iterating through layers, how can I include vectors layers, exclude
layers without geometry, and include rasters? At the moment, I have:

try:
    if layer.type() == 0:
        testDump = layer.rendererV2().dump()
    code goes here
except:
    pass

This seems very ugly to me...

Yes it has come up many times before and I think a better approach would be self-registration - perhaps we can take a similar approach to the donations popup after clicking download and encourage our users to add themselves to our user map. And also prompt them to do this on ?first run? in QGIS. Akbar has been looking, I think, at adding the user map he built for InaSAFE to http://hub.qgis.org to replace the moribund one we have there.

I don?t think it is beyond the realm of possibility that we have 1/2 million installations out there - though there are also questions about reuse rate (e.g. many could have installed once, had a play and then uninstalled).

Hi Tim,

Yes, I am planning to add django-user-map to the QGIS Django site (I'll ask
you or Alessandro about the detail of it later). Before adding new
features, I actually want to clean up the project a bit:

   - Adding docker scripts for development, staging, and production. Tim,
   could you review it? (https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/pull/12) I am
   not sure now if it's still running fine - it's been almost a month in the
   PR :-), so I will look at that PR again this week so later it's ready for
   you to review (I'll inform you when it's ready). That PR is changing the
   project structure in some ways. It's easier to merge that first and work on
   other things having that as the base.
   - Add travis and coveralls for a nicer testing platform.
   - Add some initial fixtures e.g the simplemenu (from the dump I got from
   you, I'll see other things that should be in the fixtures)

thanks, GRASS_PREFIX7 works for me. BTW, was really necessary to add
the new cmake variables for GRASS 7? BTW2, I would expect
GRASS7_PREFIX and not GRASS_PREFIX7.

Separate variables allow to compile with both GRASS 6 and GRASS 7 in one build.

Message-ID: <CAFFV8FjaUTk4Ab05S7H5BTOTEAkya=-eBgq62R5tk+B-67eRpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

This issue just appeared on gis.stackexchange:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/157846/qgis-2-8-how-can-layer-selectedfeatures-return-an-empty-list-while-layer-sel


selectedFeatures() returns an empty list if lots of features are selected.

I tested with a Spatialite layer and QGIS shows "SQLite error: Expression
tree is too large (maximum depth 1000)" in the Spatialite log panel but
there is no other indication (i.e. error thrown) of anything going wrong.

Code to reproduce:

layer = qgis.utils.iface.activeLayer()
nbrSelected=layer.selectedFeatureCount()
selection01 = layer.selectedFeatures()

What I've noticed is that if I select *more than 999 features*, nbrSelected
still returns the correct number of points, but

len(selection01)

returns 0... the list is empty.
Should I open a ticket? Or is there something I'm missing?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

Hi Anita,

I can imagine it is related to sending huge request like "fid=1 or fid=2
or fid=3 or fid=4..." and spatialite does not like it... I will try if
changing it to "fid in (1,2,3,4...)" makes it any better.

Anyway, please open a ticket for it, this definitely looks like a bug.

Best,
Matthias

Message-ID: <9235D4288D3B404981895C73BB66DA8DDA044B56@MAILBOX02.Randers.dk>

Hi qgis developers.

I?ve downloaded a c++ plugin sample from https://github.com/thebigspoon/qgis_cpp_plugin_cookbook and managed to compile the source with Visual Studio 2012 Express and the MOC.exe from \OSGeo4W\bin\
The resulting DLL was placed in \OSGeo4W\apps\qgis\plugins and from the plugin log in QGIS I can see that QGIS tries to load the plugin but fails with the following error message:
Failed to load <path to plugin> (Reason: Cannot load library <path to plugin>: The specified procedure could not be found) (the last sentence was translated from Danish)

First of all - is it possible to build plugins with Visual Studio or am I supposed to use MinGW?

I?ve tried to do a dumpbin.exe /exports for my DLL and I got the following
0001100A category = @ILT+5(_category)
000110E1 classFactory = @ILT+220(_classFactory)
00011168 description = @ILT+355(_description)
00011537 icon = @ILT+1330(_icon)
0001164A name = @ILT+1605(_name)
00011550 type = @ILT+1355(_type)
0001125D unload = @ILT+600(_unload)
000112DA version = @ILT+725(_version)

Am I missing a required function?

Any suggestions or comments are greatly appreciated
TIA
Kaare

?Thanks J?rgen! From what I can see in
?
45d4dbe, the request should now be smaller.
Will it now throw an error when the request is too huge?

No, selectedFeatures doesn't have a way to return errors (other than returning
a list that has less entries than selectedFeatureCount()).

To avoid confusion: the error in the log before said "expression tree
too large" and not "expression text too long".

So it is very well possible that the issue is completely solved with
this change (but that needs to be verified first!)

At least it's not tied to 1000 anymore - but yes, there might be still
some other sqlite limitation.

Not directly, but reading Anita's question I got the feeling that it
could have been misinterpreted. I thought it's better to state it
explicitly ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS indexing data when editing
Message-ID: <1439382637174-5219525.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello,

I'm using QGIS 2.10.1 and 2.8.3 with PostGreSQL 9.3 and PostGIS 2.5 under
Linux openSUSE 13.2 64bits.
A strange things appear since i've move from PostGreSQL 9.1 -> 9.3

Each time I open a layer for editing, when I selected any tools (node tools
or creation entity tools), QGIS freeze about 30 sec and display 'indexing
data' progress bar. (memory of my computer grow up in same time)
After that, I could editing my data, close it and reopen editing session
whithout any problem or any crash.
But if I close my project and reopen it, again indexing data when I want to
edit a layer.

I've seen that new thing under a small layer (90 entities) and bigger one
(about 250 000 objects), same things for Polygon or Point geometry.
I've a primary key constraint and a spatial index.

Have you already see that somewhere else ? I can't find why as it never
happens before.

Best regards,

Nicolas

Good news everybody!

With recent changes to the Travis CI service we've now been able to
unlock multi-OS continuous integration testing of QGIS. This means
that now every commit and pull request will be tested on both a Linux
and OSX build.

End result is that our OSX build should be more stable and widely tested.

That's great news. Is there any chance of getting a Mac/Linux build of QGIS
with the oracle support turned on? Or at least some way to do it that
doesn't involve building from source?
Thanks,
Chris-

I'm not sure what's involved in that... in any case, it's a totally
different discussion :)

Cool! Thanks Nyall (and Matthias and everybody else busy with the
testing stuff).

Stability == GOOD

My package should have the Oracle plugin.  No way to test though.

We have talked a lot with Nyall about this. It was a requirement for a work
I was developing some months ago (it's what I was describing some emails
ago in this thead).
I suppose the work Nyall is talking about is the deep refactoring of the
Composer which will converge in the Report engine (QGIS > 3.x), is it right?

Awesome stuff Nyall - can you give any notes on what specifically you had to do to enable OS X testing?

Sure thing.  Open the .qgis2/python/plugins/processing/algs/grass7/ folder
and open the Grass7Algorithm.py file in a text editor. You can see the
changes that you'll need to make on GitHub:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/2a14ffd281d0a0e99a0a899622a29ca0efdb0852

It is just a couple small changes.  I suppose alternately you could just
download the Grass7Algorithm.py file from GitHub and replace the one in the
above mentioned folder.

Dear Nicolas,

The indexing is used for snapping in the application.
It takes a few sec when enable the first tool, but snapping is much 
faster later on.

Best wishes,
Denis

Dear Denis,

That's clear for me now. Thanks for your answer !
You're right, I feel edition with snapping much smoother than old editing
session.

Best regards.

Nicolas

Hello,

30s freeze is something which seems rather unpleasant for the user.

Could we imagine to do the indexing in background ?

And maybe indexing only what is currently in the user's extent, if this
is not what is currently done ?

Indexing a whole layer for editing seems a no-go. We should maybe have a
way to get the user to use the indexing tools only when zoomed in ?

Vincent

I am not experiencing such freeze. With a project with ~100 layers, with 
10 having more than 10k features, I have something around 2 to 3 seconds.
I beleive this is reasonable.

Indexing is started when an editing map tools (or I believe any snapping 
operation) is enabled.
Since it is required on mouse events, it needs to freeze the app in the 
mean time.

Would be an idea, although I am not sure this is really required. Nobody 
complained very much yet about this.
Martin would have to answer for saying if it's feasible or not.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Writing custom data provider (in Python)
Message-ID: <CAL5Q671ReVkrBi3=obg2d79adv2Oes27uMwXW7i2i_8+3_KvVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

the current implementation of QgsProviderRegistry is to scan the provider
plugin folder on first singleton access.

There is no way to register a provider later on, I would like to change
this behaviour so that a public registerProvider method is available (and
used internally to register providers). This would open the doors to custom
data providers in Python.

It seems like an easy pick, but is it really that easy or is there any good
reason for leaving everything as it is?

30 sec is maximum time with french cadastral map which contains lot of
objects indeed (point, plot, etc.).
It's faster with other referential.
Not a big deal, I was afraid by a bad PostGreSQL/PostGIS configuration or
something like that.

Exact same usecase here, users were forcing the app to stop thinking it 
had crashed. Displaying a message "Please wait while QGIS is preloading 
all the layer's geometry" would be a good addition.

Is this one big layer or several?
 From what I read, you'll see the progress over several layers but not 
within a single layer.

I made a new try but couldn't see any progress bar, the only thing is 
the cursor in "load" mode and a message at the end in the bottom left 
corner saying that the validation is over.

At first with one but I made a new try with 4 four layers, all in 
editing mode with snapping activated and use the node selector on one

Not much really... all the ground work was already in place and were
just waiting on Travis to open up multi OS builds again. Whoever setup
the homebrew install package (Larry?) made it super easy to install
the dependencies, and we already had 99% of the tests passing without
error on OSX. Michael Kirk had also already given this a shot so I was
able to borrow parts of his attempts which also helped a lot.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Scrutinizer testing now enabled
Message-ID: <CAB28AshJUVVnkfUG3CnvqC2Y7oo61PZQ7bciOSwkuLChdEhBbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey all,

Following up the recent launch of CI testing under OSX, Tim has now
enabled Scrutinizer checks on the QGIS master branch.
What this means is that now every commit & PR is tested by
Scrutinizer's checker. This checks for bugs and bad practices in
Python code and will alert us of any potential issues prior to merging
PRs. You can see the results of each check at the bottom of recent PRs
- you should see both the results of this check and Travis' Linux/OSX
testing.

It'll be interesting to see how useful this is in the long run, but in
any case it's a free service (for open source projects) and doesn't
require any extra infrastructure on our behalf. Hopefully it's an easy
win and is able to prevent some Python errors slipping in to the code
in future....

Nyall

Hello,

I was confronted to the same issue and was wondering why this message
appeared. Thanks to Denis, I now understand the reason.

I tried to disable snapping, save the project and restart QGIS, this
behaviour is still present when I want to insert a new feature. Can somebody
else confirm that?

Thanks.

R?mi

Thanks for the warning.

Are you referring to QEP#9 or to something else ?

What is the status of the work that is "underway" ?

What is the planned time-frame ?

Is there a branch somewhere that I can base my work on / contribute to ?

We need a composer plugin item for a customer project with a deadline in
November. We have planned a few days of dev to contribute that and we'd
rather put those efforts in a long term solution.

I've seen that, and I'm not sure I see why it prevents the introduction
of a plugin item (+registry) that would be used as a base class for
python objects to draw in a frame that is part of a composition.

Yes, I set up the QGIS Homebrew formulae in the osgeo/osgeo4mac tap.

For example, to set up a dev environ on Mac:
https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/wiki/Developing-on-QGIS-using-OSGeo4Mac

I haven't had time recently to update the work there, so some of the notes
may be outdated.

Thanks Larry, this made it really easy to implement this.

I'm wondering- is there a way to prevent the installation of
postgres/postgis when installing the dependencies? It slows the build down
a lot and conflicts with the existing preinstalled postgis available on
Travis.

Sorry Vincent, I've been a bit swamped over the last week and haven't had a
chance to respond yet. I'll put down a detailed email sometime over the
next couple of days outlining the situation.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Troubles with qwtpolar
Message-ID: <55D0AAE5.9010301@carto.net>

Hi,

I upgraded a laptop with Ubuntu 15.04 and I can't compile QGIS because 
of qwtpolar. I tried with internal qwtpolar, but it complains that it is 
not compatible with qwt6.1 and above (which seems to be the default in 
Ubuntu 15.04). It also seems like Ubuntu 15.04 doesn't provide a package 
for qwtpolar, so if I turn internal qwtpolar off it complains that it 
can't find qwtpolar.

What do you recommend to do on Ubuntu 15.04?

Thanks,
Andreas

Using the -DWITH_QWTPOLAR=OFF CMake option should be sufficient to build
QGIS with Qwt >= 6.1.

The qwtpolar embedded copy needs to be updated to qwtpolar-1.1 for Qwt
>= 6.1 support, see:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13156

Kind Regards,

Bas

Did you install libqwt5-qt4-dev?  That's what the nightlies use.  You could
also just use the nightlies or build packages (which produce a build dir
with the working settings from debian/ in debian/build).

Andreas,

I would like to suggest that qwtpolar option be changed to OFF 
permanently and use the embedded copy exclusively.  I have had trouble 
with option a couple of times and have tried to install the qwtpolar 
library.  And have wasted a hour each time trying to reinstall before I 
remember the change needed. The library  is no longer being maintained 
and is probably dead code.

I also build using Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

TIA

J.O. Williams

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Troubles with qwtpolar

Message-ID: <55D0D686.1000505@opengis.ch>

Short background:

History:
 * qwtpolar is used for showing the satellite map on the gps widget
 * ubuntu, debian (osgeo4w, mac I guess) don't ship qwtpolar packages
 * therefore qwtpolar source code is shipped with the qgis source code
 * the qwtpolar source code in the qgis repository is no longer
compatible with the latest qwt library

Options:
 * update the qwtpolar source code in the qgis repository
 * remove the satellite display (that's what's currently done when
qwtpolar is disabled)
 * re-implement the satellite display without unpackaged external
dependencies (I'd love to see somebody do that, e.g. a QML component
would be great)

Until then: make sure you have an old qwt library ready (qwt < 6.1),
have a system that ships a recent version of qwtpolar (e.g. Fedora) or
turn off WITH_QWTPOLAR.

Cheers,
Matthias

Hi,

Thank you all for you hints. I ended up having to set WITH_QWTPOLAR to 
off. All the other options did not work.

At least I could compile QGIS this way. I don't use GPS on this laptop 
anyway.

Thanks,
Andreas

Hi Marcus,
so from your report the implementation seems almost complete now. What
do you suggest as the easiest way to try it out? I think more exposure
will be good, at this stage.
All the best, and thanks!

Agreed - and in my opinion we could even have 1 million users. As said
before, I'd be very interested in having stats on user distribution, in
order to better understand our user base, relationship with donations
and sponsorship, etc.
All the best.

Hi all,
thanks Radim for these detailed info. Could we make them more prominent,
in order to stimulate interest on it?
Perhaps a post on QGIS official blog?

Hi,

We're having problems not being able to start a new QThread as described here:
"using python multiprocessing package inside a qgis plugin code" [1]

We've already looked around and found this often referenced blog post
by snorfalorpagus [2] and [3] which boils down to this snippet:

    # start the worker in a new thread
    thread = QtCore.QThread(self)
    worker.moveToThread(thread)  # worker is an object derived from QObject
    thread.started.connect(worker.run)
    thread.start()

The problem is, that a new thread id is being created but the main
thread remains blocked.
Any ideas?

Didn't find a QGIS issue on github though.

Hi Paolo,

Yes, we still have a lot of algorithms to refactor but this should be an easy work to do. As I mentioned on the report, the implementation do not cover all the algorithms.

I have been using a symbolic link between my local repository and the QGIS directory (e.g. ~/.qgis2/python/plugins/processing) to test the processing plugin but maybe it?s better to add an experimental plugin for wider testing.

Marcus

Hi all,
I spotted a few mistakes, but overall I found this relatively unbiased:
http://gisgeography.com/qgis-arcgis-differences/
IMHO it contains some useful hints on the areas we could concentrate on
for further improvements, e.g.
#2: removing the `Add something` buttons in favour of the Browser only
#6: adding more default services (WMS, WFS, CSW)
etc.
All the best.

I wonder why UI is not generated on the fly or during compilation? To
maintain manually UI in QGIS is complicated and the result will be
always out-of-date. Just 2 my cents, Martin

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Translation plugin (accents)
Message-ID: <1439894121252-5220118.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello, I have developped a plugin in Spanish and I want to translate it to
English. I have problems with accented words in the class that describe the
interface, which I compilate from *.ui to *.py.

This is a fragment of the .ts file, which doesn't work:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE TS>
<TS version="2.0" language="en_US" sourcelanguage="es_ES">
<context>
    <name>DEMto3DDialogBase</name>
    <message>
        <location filename="DEMto3D_dialog_base.py" line="342"/>
        <source>Extensi?n a imprimir</source>
        <translation>Print Extension</translation>
    </message>
</context>
....

In the class 'DEMto3DDialogBase' show like this inside the function 'def
retranslateUi':
/self.groupBox_2.setTitle(_translate("DEMto3DDialogBase", u"Extensi?n a
imprimir", None))/

Any idea if I was missing something.

Thank you.

Hi,

Can you clarify which kind of problems you are experiencing. I.e. do you
have any error messages or unexpected behavior.

Hi
The problem is that the translation doesn't work with accented words when I
launch QGIS. However the words with no accent are translated correctly. No
message error appear and the plugin works good.

Cheers

UI is generated on the fly when a module UI is opened. It is using
options description printed by GRASS module (--interface-description)
combined with options definition for the module in QGIS (.qgm file).
The additional options definition in QGIS is mainly for two purposes:

1) limit number of options not to frighten users, some GRASS modules
are also represented as multiple items with predefined options

2) define relations between options (e.g. type or column option
relation with input vector) or special options which has dedicated
widget in UI (e.g. GDAL/OGR input).

It was surely difficult to keep options in sync with GRASS modules,
but with the new debugging tool (in master), it is possible to check
all options/modules with just one click.

Dear QGIS users and Developers

Following my call for nominations for a new PSC Treasurer position, we
received 4 nominations - all for Andreas Neumann.

Since we have only one candidate, there is no need to call for a vote. If
anyone has a substantive reason why Andreas should not be appointed as the
project treasurer, please contact me by email. If we have not heard any
reason opposing Andreas should be appointed the next PSC meeting (first wed
in September), we will go ahead and make the appointment.

Many thanks

Regards

Tim

Finally the problem was the encoding of the .ts file.

I replace the first line for:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="iso-8859-1" ?>

Now translation works fine.

Hi,

In general one should prefer to go the other way round and make sure all
your resources (.py/.ui etc) are in utf-8.

And if you are happy that it works for you now and don't want to invest
more time, this message will at least serve for future reference :)

Hi Radim and Martin,

I guess that one of the reasons for QGIS interface for GRASS. Anyway, is
there a option of not using .qgm file and using --interface-description
only? This would not only enable some of the hidden features but more
importantly, it would enable to use of modules from GRASS GIS Addons
repository.

This should be defined in GRASS GIS. If it is missing in GRASS or in the
--interface-description then it is a bug which should be solved.

Here are examples of guidependency "option attribute":

https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/vector/v.distance/main.c#L222
https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/browser/grass/trunk/scripts/v.what.vect/v.what.vect.py#L15

This sounds really good.

Best,
Vaclav

Hi all

In the last few years we have been steadily improving the amount of funding we are able to accumulate in the QGIS project. Our goal in obtaining funding is always to 'make QGIS better'. Up until now we have focussed funding on high profile aspects of the project: Funding regular hackfests, paying for bug fixing work prior to releases, funding infrastructure such as servers, domain name registrations etc. 

With improved funding levels we now have the opportunity to also start addressing some of the many less obvious components of QGIS that badly need attention, but often don't attract volunteers. In our July 2015 PSC meeting it was agreed that we would start this initiative by funding one or more developers to improve the python documentation in QGIS. If you are interested in working on this, please be so kind as to visit the form [1] that we have set up for this.

Yeah, the postgres and postgis being preinstalled is a bit of a pain, since
they do not seem to keep them updated.

Looks like, since they *are* installed, you can try skipping them (and
other non-essential recommended libs) as dependencies with:

$ brew install qgis-28 --without-postgis --without-postgresql
--without-grass --without-gpsbabel --only-dependencies

That should be the minimum for a Travis CI setup (not tested). The only
funky one is '--without-postgresql', which is a hard dependency, but the
CMake variable POSTGRES_CONFIG:FILEPATH=/usr/local/bin/pg_config should be
found by default. It was with my test on 10.9.5. Apple's system-provided
postgresql client is woefully outdated.

The GRASS provider is part of the unit test suite (for both 6 and 7 if
found), but, if skipped, should greatly speed up the CI builds.

I just updated the formula with 2.8.3. Let me know if you need me to add
more options to it to facilitate the Travis setup.

Hi Tim,

Thank you for writing this proposal:  QGIS developer documentation really
needs some more love :)

While reading the form, I noticed that one of the goals is

* port the cookbook content over to the API documentation

Does this mean the end of the cookbook? I hope not!

IMHO the purpose of the cookbook is not to be a full API reference but a
collection of small tutorials (recipes), with some introductory material.

I've spent quite some time lately trying to update the cookbook by
proofreading and testing the examplesand adding new recipes and I think
that the cookbook is an invaluable source of informations for PyQGIS
programmers, the biggest problem is that it is not routinely updated when
the underlying API changes, for instance there are no recipes for
QgsMapSettings or QgsMapRendererCustomPainterJob and a few examples use
deprecated methods.

I liked a lot the idea we discussed in Denmark about adding tests directly
in the rst sphynx code, this would be a nice improvement for the code
examples and snippets.

I think that the cookbook must continue to exist, it would be awesome if
the process of writing code examples could be automated to transfer them to
the cookbook, adding the snippets to travis would be a nice start but we
all should definitely dedicate more resources for keeping the cookbook in
sync with the source code changes.

Generally speaking I like a lot how the Django project team handles their
(very high quality) documentation [1],  the policy is also a bit strict but
definitely worth reading [2]:

Long live the cookbook :)

I know, it was discussed. Generic UI is not currently supported, I am
considering that.

The guidependency is very welcome, but it is not available in GRASS 6.
However, qgm requires explicitly defined vector map <-> field, type
relation, I'll try to implement defaults if single vector is used.

Thanks Larry - this has knocked about 10 minutes off the build time!
Much appreciated :)

Still no luck with getting the postgres test working yet though. I
suspect that Travis has issues with the default postgres installation
under their OSX containers.

Under a normal Homebrew install of postgres it is not running. If you look
at `brew info postgresql` you will see at the end:

"To load postgresql:
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
Or, if you don't want/need launchctl, you can just run:
  postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres"

I don't see anything in QGIS/ci/travis/osx that indicates postgres is being
spun up, i.e.:

/usr/local/bin/postgres -D /usr/local/var/postgres

Regarding the GRASS provider tests, I can redo the grass-64 builds so that
there are fresh 'bottles' (compiled binary installs) for quick loading.
Then GRASS is only a ~20 MB download and its tests can be run. Likewise,
GRASS7 ends up only 24 MB. I can work on these bits as needed. I'm away
from my build server (where I generate the bottles) today, though.

I also really like the cookbook, though I worry about the maintenance of it - if we can do the tests in ret to make sure that it remains current that would be one good motivation for keeping it current. An alternative approach would be to move the content of the cookbook into doxygen documentation (you can add arbitrary pages there - they don?t all need to be generated from header files. 

But let me rather step back and say that my intention in the proposal was more that we sponsor someone to really look into these things and come up with a well established standard - something like the django folks have done in your link below. We obviously don?t currently have funding for a complete revision of every single source file, but I think if the person we hire can establish a good working system, it will be easier to point others to when they submit patches, telling them ?we need docs with that!? - and pointing the to examples and instructions on how to document their code nicely.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Add plugin to sub-menu
Message-ID: <CA+24CoR4=GGUpXmFHm_hpLn9-5iHCg4Gp0FCE9pmkXJ6a_xxgw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

It would be great if someone could help me with the following:

I have a plugin[1] that is shown within the Vector menu.
However, I would like to have it show up in the sub-menu *Geoprocessing
Tools*.
For that I tried using the following code:

  self.iface.addPluginToVectorMenu("&Geoprocessing Tools", self.action)

Without success. This simply creates a new sub-menu item with the same name
as the existing one.

Does anybody know how to fix this issue?

Many thanks in advance!

Kind regards.
Erik Timmers

Ok, agreed.

The Django folks are very picky about "Have documentation" and "Have tests"
before accepting any patch, and the documentation always have examples.

Doxygen also accepts RST and we could place python documentation into .sip
files, maybe a solution would be to include snippets and examples from
doxygen (.sip is preferred) into the cookbook, leaving the introductory
material in the cookbook itself interleaved with included examples and
snippets.

I don't know about QT but most of the (not API) documentation I've seen is
made with sphinx, I might be wrong (maybe is just that I know sphinx better
than doxygen) but I suspect that moving the whole cookbook into doxygen and
outside from the rest of the documentation (user manual, tutorial etc.) is
not a good idea.

The .sip are maintained by comparing them with the header files
(scripts/sipdiff).  So IMHO they should be kept as close to them as possible - 
at least in the section with the actual interfaces.  

But more verbose sections above or below the actual code shouldn't be a problem
(that part is mostly not in synced anyway).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Performance issues in Lizmap (apache?)
Message-ID: <55D5E4B6.8070008@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
I'm finding problems in having decent performances in a Lizmap installation:
http://webgis.provincia.belluno.it
The loading of each tile is quite slow, to the point that having no
cache, single tile rendering is often faster, which makes little sense.
Debugging it, it is clear that the bottleneckk is at the apache level:
I'm using multithreads in apache, but the processes seem to hang for a
long time. Perhaps apache is scanning the tiles subdirectories, and that
requires a long time?
Thanks for any hint.
All the best.

Hello all,


I noticed that the "Topology Checker" C++ plugin  does not permit to save
problematic elements in a layer.

This will be implemented, in the near future ?


I think this would be a very useful thing.

Where can I put my request  ?   Could you tell me the direct link ?


Thank you

Message-ID: <2b15f12876ee47cc832e450b71d5dfa4@NINSRV23.nina.no>

Hi,

I just started using Lizmap and I am very happy with it. Now I would very much like to use the time manager feature in Lizmap. Unfortunately it does not seem to work properly.

My maps do load nicely in Lizmap, but when I activate the Time Manager it does not go beyond "Loading map data". In other words I am facing the same problem like here: https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2014-August/028981.html

I have Lizmap 2.10 on an internal server with lots of memory and ca. 650 points in total in a PostGIS database with single symbol (at the end I would like to use ca. 90k which render nicely without time manager) ...

Is that a bug or a browser (I use Mozilla Firefox) thing? http://demo.lizmap.3liz.com/index.php/view/map/?repository=rep6&project=trees# did not load with time manager either?

Thanks for helping in advance.

Kind regards
Stefan

add it here:

+1 here, we've been facing such problems with cache that is not so fast.
We also see that apache is 100% CPU sometimes by non cached queries, then
simple cache queries are retained until CPU is available. 
We are still working on it with 3Liz to find all the bottlenecks. 
We also have trouble with performance to access CIFS ressources (raster). 

Hope we can find the right architecture and parameters soon. 

R?gis

Hi again,

I tested also Chrome Browser which seemed to be a bit faster than Firefox. Yet, Time manager does not load in Chrome either...
Probably related to the problem Paolo / Regis are reporting?

This shouold not be the case (same behaviour if using SQLite tiles).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS Server and Virtual Fields with custom function
Message-ID: <CAMB2qw06+OqXpePEEfNnwg=BZm+eN2u03=1DokhpdajU-HQymA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have QGIS Server LTS 2.8.3 installed on a debian server.

I made a custom virtual field that calls a simple function expression
that returns the string "hello, world".

On QGIS Web Client, when I query the feature, the value of that
virtual fields is always set to "NULL".

It seems that QGIS Server doesn't evalutate the custom function... it
is the right behaviour?

How can I recognize G_OPT_V_TYPE in  --interface-description? It does
not have gisprompt.

Right [1]. I think this is a bug. No gisprompt is there. I think wxGUI
doesn't need it because the values for the combo box are defined there
already.

I suppose we can add something like 'type' or 'vtype' as one of the values
for gisprompt. No 'type' is currently used in the gisprompt, although it
might have been used in the past [2]. Probably the following could be the
gisprompt:

'old,vtype,vtype'
'old,v3type,v3type'

Unfortunately, I'm not sure about 'old' versus 'new' in this context (for
other things then maps) but hopefully somebody knows. I'm also not sure
about handing of unknown gisprompts in wxGUI but this can be easily tested.

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for your reply.

My project is already quite minimalistic. It contains only one active / toogled layer from a Materialized View in PostGIS with ~ 650 points... (there is one other layer which is toogled off. I will remove for a test).
I tested both a datetime field (without timezone) and an integer field with different temporal granularities (1, 5, 20, and 50 years). No idea if the optional grouping fields might influence the situation (I did not use them so far...). Can it a problem if the field used in time manager contains NULL? 

As mentioned, the Montpellier tree demo (a bit more than 10k trees) did not work either for me: http://demo.lizmap.3liz.com/index.php/view/map/?repository=rep6&project=trees#...

Cheers
Stefan

Hi all,

I just noticed that in 2.10 (and developing) version is not possible
to change geometries for the postgres data provider while all work
fine in LTR. The following code returns False in 2.10 and master
version (I get superuser permissions on the database):

>>> vl = iface.activeLayer()
>>> provider = vl.dataProvider()
>>> provider.capabilities() & QgsVectorDataProvider.ChangeGeometries

Anyone confirms?

Hi,

Side remark. Your plugin probably makes it a bit more convenient, but you can 
already get the geometries in WKT format with "Save as", select CSV and enter 
GEOMETRY=AS_WKT as layer creation option (cf http://www.gdal.org/drv_csv.html)

Message-ID: <CA+-DBufWE_z+9LoysxQX4Zq9N2YP_-amKCsSU3W2A87m14_y_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,
I have set up Eclipse and I am developing a QGIS external application.
I will want most of the QGIS as they are, while I will have to add my
own. I was able to add the navigation tools using MapTool from QGIS. I
was wondering if it is possible to add the split feature, add feature,
node tools from QGIS digitizing toolbar.

I want to develop a standalone application and add the default
digitizing and advanced digitizing tools in QGIS as-is on my
application through PyQGIS. Is it similar the way you add the
navigation tools (like Pan Zoom In and Out..)? What do you suggest?

Any help would be appreciated.

?What does it do differently than "Save as ..." to CSV with WKT?

Touche' ,  Even  :)

I do not know that is possible to do the same with save as...   :(

BTW,  great !    There is some documentation for this ?   I will browse
QGIS manuals.

Sure, my method is more immediate, and more convenient for my own use.
For the rest of the world, I agree with you :   a generic user, can use
"Save as..."   CSV  and enter  "GEOM=ASWKT"
and... it does not work !  What is the correct syntax ?  I do not
remember:  I need to try again... perhaps:  "GEOMETRY=ASWKT".   No, it do
not work again... etcetera.

:)

Yes, I think my plugin can be useful to all of us "QGIS dummies"    :)

If you think, I can insert a message that explains:  "You can also use
'Save as... CSV    GEOMETRY=AS_WKT'

:)


Of course, I am joking.


Happy holidays

Indeed, the good news is that with GDAL 2.0, OGR drivers now have metadata. So  
instead/in addition of a free text zone, the list of options could now 
potentially be automatically generated by inspecting driver metadata

Even,

I noticed that  "Plain Geometry Editor"  plugin   (and also my  "WktExport"
plugin :)   saves  some elements as

" LineStringZ "

that of course have also the Z.

This is good for my use (the 3D  digitizing) ,  but I am asking :   is it a
new of QGIS 2.10,   or it just exists before ?

So, my need is to display these Z, for each point of the lines.   There is
a way to do this ?   I tried with "processing >  SAGA > Shapes-Points >
convert lines to points"  but, the result is a points layer  without Z.

Also,  Layer property panel  do not permits to display the Z value as Label.

Any other suggestion to display Z values ?


Thank you

Roberto

Please add it if it is not there :-)

Another option (though with a huge data set maybe not so convenient),
but copy/paste selected geometries in a text editor will also show WKT.

Message-ID: <CAFTGJ2BdN5UhTUCJtx5zNhFnLZMrROS8S+shDF0zJN2QU1y1Gw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Replicating the SQLite based methodology in:
http://gisforthought.com/centroid-within-selection-in-qgis/

But using a plugin. Was surprisingly straightforward, but an
absolutely essential tool if selection postcode areas that fall within
local council areas for example.

Performance needs some work, and would love to see the functionality
added to the Spatial Query core plugin in the future.

Also having some issues with my metadata.txt file.

It reads:
[general]
name=Select Within

description=Centroid within and point of surface within selection
between vector layers.
category=Vector
version=0.1
experimental=False
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
author=Heikki Vesanto
email=heikki.vesanto at thinkwhere.com

icon=icon.png

homepage=gisforthought.com
deprecated=False

repository=https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/QGIS_Centroid_Within/
tracker=https://github.com/HeikkiVesanto/QGIS_Centroid_Within/issues

tags=vector, select, selection, polygon, analysis

But on the http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SelectWithin/ page the
repository points to:
http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/SelectWithin/repo%20url

Tried re-uploading and re-saving my metadata but alas no help.

Any questions happy to answer.

Hi all,
I'm trying to reduce redundancy in the plugin repo: would you think it
is really useful to publish this one, given that it replicates exixting
functionality?
Thanks for your opinions.
All the best.

Hi Jawensi,
thanks a lot for this. Would you mind publishing it on the QGIS official
repo? This will greatly improve visibility and popularity of it.
I'm available for help if needed.
All the best.

I will integrate my code into another plugin, to support 3D point saving. 
So, I admit, WktExport is not so important (also if it could be didactic :)

The fact remains that the documentation of this feature is missing, and then "someone" may plan to implement something that already exists... but I enjoyed doing it, and then that's okay  :)

Thank you all

Roberto

 datasource of intermediate results
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FiF3spY7Q7rX_88q0kDqpOqT16MXQgAkdWESQZJCEdeRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

There seems to be a regression between Processing 2.9 and 2.10 where 2.10
fails to run models because it cannot find the intermediate results it
produced in a previous step. The model runs perfectly in 2.9. Bellow you
can see an example to reproduce: just chain QGIS buffer and OGR dissolve
and it fails because it's looking for a file
:\Users\agraser\AppData\Local\Temp\processing\7f77fa47bcec4799818d1f5ea41cc8a9\OUTPUT.sh
(without C: and .sh instead of .shp)

Are you already aware of this or should I open a ticket.

Best wishes,
Anita

?I'd rather if we could keep it unpublished if Roberto doesn't mind. Save
as CSV code is already maintained in core. If newbies see the plugin in the
list, they might assume that it's the only way and in case it breaks they
could think that QGIS has no more capabilities to export CSV.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi,

As Even already said that with gdal 2.0 it is possible to populate an
options list automatically.
 I think it should be possible that, depending on the GDAL version, we
already integrate this into the "Save As" Dialog for people already
using gdal 2.0 .. and for all others maybe "help popups" could
describe where to find info about the options that are possible to
use. (ok - that should have been done long time ago :) )
For GDAL < 2.0 the text box was on purpose, so that users can enter
whatever they find on the GDAL webpages and use it.

regards,
Werner

I'm glad that my small and futile plugin may have been useful to improve
the interface of QGIS, and reveal powerful hidden possibilities.

"The useless can sometimes be useful"

I will write an useless book about this  ;)


Thank you and regards

Checking deeper I realized that the different behavior between master
and LTR is due to this commit [0].
Why it is not possible to modify the existing geometries if the
primary key is not present?

Just wondering. Thanks.

Because ctids are very flaky - any modification to the row might or will change
it - without QGIS noticing.  So previously selected features might mysteriously
loose their selection, subsequent updates or deletes might fail or even worse
update or delete a different feature.

Sounds familiar - must have been reported somewhere else already - not sure if
I know it from a ticket.

gosh, very bad, thanks for the clarification. Will be this change
candidate for LTR version?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [Processing] translate parameter selection
	dropdown contents
Message-ID: <55DDB5F9.1020501@camptocamp.com>


Hello,

In processing algorithms, I want to translate the ParameterSelection 
dropdown contents.

I've tested two possibilities on SpatialJoin, which both operate,
and I want to get review before editing all algorithms :

First solution: use of QCoreApplication.translate('SpatialJoin', ...) in 
the class header:

https://github.com/arnaud-morvan/QGIS/commit/0daefe838c2b02c8a1bbeffdec551f578424b592

     With this form we have to specify context for each string.
     Translation is effectively made at import time because language is 
set before loading processing plugin.

Second solution: use self.tr method in the defineCharacteristics method :

https://github.com/arnaud-morvan/QGIS/commit/0286c3d95dffeee65ff7a6b7a69919d700815e4b

     With this form, we use the self.tr method at runtime on each 
defineCharacteristics call, like it is the case for name, group and 
parameters names.


I think that it is better to make translations at runtime, that is, in 
the defineCharacteristics method.

Does anyone have an opinion on this ?

Hi to all

I am currently exploring options for developing a plugin for which background processing (i.e. not blocking the QGIS UI) would be nice, though not essential.  In all other respects it looks like the QGIS Processing framework is the best option for the interface I want, not least because of logging history etc.

Is background processing for the Processing framework (i.e. mirroring what Arc does) something that's on the roadmap for QGIS in the foreseeable future?

Thanks & best regards

Crispin

Hi,
I reported this already some weeks ago: https://hub.qgis.org/issues/13174
My suspicion was, that this is related to GDAL processes, cause all others  
seem to run fine.

Hi all,
in one month the freeze for next version will start[0]. Did we already
decided whether this will be 2.12 or 3.0? I suppose we'll not migrate to
py3 and qt5, so we'll stick to 2.12, right?
All the best.

Any idea how to install the plugin under Linux? Just unzipping it in
plugins directory didn't work.

Thank you!

Thanks Bernd,
Must have missed that the first time.
I guess some file handling must have changed between processing 2.9 and
2.10 that broke it.

Confirmed here. Looks like a bug then.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Segmentation fault immediately after QGIS start
Message-ID: <55DECC3F.3000805@carto.net>

Hi,

With the newest master I get a segmentation fault immediately after 
starting. Even before loading a project.

Maybe this has to do with the recent start screen modifications?

Here are the last debug messages:

Do you have any idea on what may be wrong? If no, I can go back in git 
history and try to find the commit that makes my QGIS crash on start.

Hi Luigi,

what are steps to test it ?   May I recompile all QGIS ?


Thank you for any info about this

Hi Roberto,

no you don't need to recompile whole QGIS, just grab Processing code.
Also note that right now not all algorithms support multithreaded execution.

Might be one of the leak fixes I committed - can you checkout
2f60a5f85c1e107a8047127bb1a8e7d617f7c2a5 and see if the crash is
present?

Hi Marcus,


can you indicate me what it is needed to test your multithread processing
support ?   These are my questions:

1)  there is a bin installable version ?    Or,  it is needed to recompile
all QGIS and libraries ?

2)  In the second case,  there is a list of needed operations ?


Thank you in advance for the infos and for your excelent work

Roberto

I have QGIS 2.10.1 installed.   I have no any developer version.   Can I
install  Processing code  "grabbing"  in what way ?
What I have to do,  exactly ?    Can you send me the link ?   I need to
recompile only  Processing code ?


Thank you and sorry if I am a little  "dummy"  :)

Hi Roberto,

You just have to put the processing code into your QGIS directory. Should be something like this:

 ~/.qgis/python/plugins/processing 

After that you can run the QGIS as you normally do, without having to compile anything.

Be aware that the multithreading is not working with all algorithms.

Cheers,
Marcus

Oh sorry, this is the link: 

https://github.com/mvcsantos/QGIS

Look for the master branch, you'll find the code there.

Hello
A pre-compiled packages of Slic3r for Windows is shipped in the DEMto3D
installation folder, so I have to develope the access to Slic3r in other
platforms. Slic3r is used to generate the Gcode file. Meanwhile I just
upload to the QGIS official repo a DEMto3D version which only allows export
DEM to STL.

Regards.

Exactly, you just need to put the processing plugin under the plugins directory.

Well, I?m not sure if it works the same way on Windows but I suppose it?s the same.

I guess so.

Thank you for testing the new implementation. 
I'm looking forward to hear about the multithreading behaviour on Windows :)

Marcus,

the ZIP you indicated is a complete QGIS source .

Where  is your    Processing   installable on Windows ?   Do I need to
recompile something ?

I'm afraid I do not understand what I need to do.    Could you please
explain me the singular steps ?


Thank you

Roberto

Hi Roberto,

again, there is no need to recompile.

All you need is to grab Processing code from the repository mentioned
by Marcus [0]. Not all code, only Processing. Look at the python/plugins
directory. Then put this code into your QGIS plugins directory. Usually this
is ~/.qgis2/python/plugins. That's all.

After this you can start QGIS as usual and test.

Ok.

Thank you all.  I have done  :)

Sorry, but I am slow on the uptake   :)

Now, I am following this:

Do you suggest me other  multithread  functions active to test ?

Thank you again

Subject: [Qgis-developer] digitizing issues in master
Message-ID: <1440684716526-5221470.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi, 
I'm digitizing in current master and couldn't achieve my work, had to switch
back to 2.10.

First issue is not being able to select a bunch of node with node tool using
clic and drag on screen. Did that change?

Second issue is new node window coming up automatically . The interaction
with canvas is unclear to me, just mousing over it and that snapped some
node in the list and started moving those node somewhere outside of my
digitising extent. The node window is a good idea. That should really show
only node in screen extent IMHO. Selecting a node from the list should be
more explicit, and one should be able to deactivate that I think.

Third issue is that I couldn't find a way to release the "snapped node". Had
to finish move the node and the undo the edit. 

Is there some work in progress there?

Cheers
R?gis

Marco is working on the node tool.
It has been reworked to allow Z/M editing.

It is now in click-click mode (not drag and drop anymore) to allow 
keybord input while moving a node for advanced digitizing.

There are a bunch of issues I opened:
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13257
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13275
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/13276

A polished node tool should come soon, as it is barely usable in its 
current state.

You?re welcome :)

You can test the ?processing.runalg? method from the python console.
SAGA and GDAL/OGR algorithms are supposed be working also, can you try it out? 

Thank you,
Marcus

Hello,

without further notice, I will work on processing dropdown parameter 
translation next week, that is:

     modify all algorithms in the QGIS group, like this :
https://github.com/arnaud-morvan/QGIS/commit/0286c3d95dffeee65ff7a6b7a69919d700815e4b

     and make a Pull Request

Best Regards

Arnaud

In my opinion, is much better to translate at runtime. Don't forget
that providers can be loaded and unloaded, and also updated (as it
happens with the SAGA one when the path to the SAGA executables is
changed), so that is a better option.

Thanks for this works!

Hi,

I'm working with QGIS master, compiled the day before yesterday, and it
crashed me (segmentation fault) several times when I was doing "Refresh" in
the Browser Panel (inside QGIS), 3 or 4 times in a row.

I have the backtrace of 3 of these crashes:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QGIS 2.10.1 currently uninstallable on Debian sid?
Message-ID: <55E007E1.3010003@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
the package requires liblwgeom-2.1.7, which is not available (I think
this should be replaced with 2.1.8). As a result, python-qgis cannot be
installed.
Should I open a ticket?
Thanks.

Hi all,
SAGA 2.2.0 is currently on Debian (testing and sid). As a result, a
number of commend do not work (once again). Is there anyone working on
it, or planning to? I believe Victor has a script that tests all
commends, to quickly spot the broken ones.
All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] DB Manager changing behaviour?
Message-ID: <55E009CE.6090600@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
currently, DB Manager throws an error for a query like this:

SELECT aaa, ST_Area(geom) AS bbb
 FROM ccc
 ORDER BY bbb

requiring instead:

SELECT aaa, ST_Area(geom) AS "bbb"
FROM ccc
ORDER BY bbb

This is correct, but annoying, and breaks previous queries. Is the
change really necessary? Wouldn't it be better to revert it?

Thanks.

With the ongoing GCC 5 transitions and the uninstallable build
dependencies this causes, reporting the issue is not much use. You just
need to wait for the GCC 5 transitions to settle down and have Debian
unstable return to normal.

I just started the GEOS 3.5.0 yesterday, and to update spatialite, gdal
& postgis with GEOS the circular dependency needed to be dealt with.
SpatiaLite is not built with lwgeom currently to break the circle. For
more information see the geos transition issue [1].

By the end of the weekend most of geos reverse dependencies will be
rebuilt and the QGIS build dependencies involved in the geos transition
should be installable again and the spatialite/lwgeom regression fixed.

Hi,

I just committed a fix in the relation reference widget both in master 
[0] and release 2_10 [1].
Everything went well for Travis for master, but apparently it brke the 
qgis_rasterlayertest [2].

Should I do something?
I would tend to decline any responsability in this ;)

Sorry I was unclear - I'm referring to the qgis.org repo, not to the
Debian one.
Thanks for the feedback (and BTW, any idea on how long will it take to
complete the gcc5 transition?).
All the best.

And it's already fixed[1]. But for the reasons you pointed out, the package
build doesn't complete.

Still the pretty much the same build dependencies.

No, but now that vacations and DebConf are over it seems to be speeding
up a bit. Many maintainers have not prepared the GCC 5 transition for
their libraries packages yet, so it's up to a few DDs how care enough to
get those done too.

My guess it's going to take at least another month or two. Maybe longer,
so I hope to get my distribution back as a Christmas present and that we
won't need to make "Finish GCC 5 transitions" a New Years resolution.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Refresh after what has happened outside the browser? It could be a
crash when an item was added/removed and the browser crashes trying to
apply that change to the tree. But that is one of the very basic tasks
it is doing (files are even auto refreshed using system notifier) so
there would have to be something particular in it.

Maybe a GRASS item? GRASS mapset with import running?

Not surprising.  Old packages won't work, because their dependencies are gone
and new ones won't build, because the newer build dependencies are currently
partly uninstallable.

> Any other solution?

Um, you shouldn't be using unstable, if you are not prepared to handle this ;)

Try building from source.

Debian unstable users are currently strongly advised to also have
stretch/testing sources to install the pre-GCC 5 transition package
version. And get security updates via testing-proposed-updates that
also cannot be built and/or migrate to testing via unstable.

Hi Bas,
thanks for the suggestion. I added testing to sources, but still cannot
find the missing deps for the packages necessary for rebuilding the
package locally.
Thanks for any hint.
All the best.

Try: apt-get build-dep -t stretch qgis

You need to explicitly specify the non-default distribution to install
the packages from.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Hi Bas,
unfortunately

doxygen : Dipende: libclang1-3.5 (>= 3.2) ma non sta per essere installato

All the best.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Segmentation fault immediately after QGIS start

Hi,

Regarding my crash/segmentation fault - I think this is a local issue I 
have with webkit - because when I open the about screen of an older QGIS 
version (2.10) it also crashes - and as the about screen also contains 
webkit it is the same crash behaviour than with the new startscreen.

Now - my question:

What webkit packages are actually recommended for QGIS? There are so 
many webkit packages to choose from in Ubuntu 15.05 that I am a bit lost 
which one is the correct one to use.

If I aptitude search for webkit, I get 144 !! results and it is a bit 
overwhelming.

Here are the ones I have installed:
Konsole output

gir1.2-webkit-3.0
Konsole output
libkdewebkit5
Konsole output
libkf5webkit5
Konsole output
libqt5webkit5
Konsole output
libqtwebkit-dev
Konsole output
libqtwebkit4
Konsole output
libwebkitgtk-3.0-0
Konsole output
libwebkitgtk-3.0-common
Konsole output
qml-module-qtwebkit

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL says I have to install 
"libqtwebkit-dev" - but maybe my libqtwebkit-dev is actually pointing to 
qt5 instead of qt4?

Could this explain the crashes I have?

Thanks for any hints on what are the correct packages for Webkit in 
Ubuntu 15.04.

Andreas

Hi Radim,


Refresh after what has happened outside the browser? It could be a

This happened just after run a GRASS plugin module, with the GRASS 7.
Specifically the module was v.kernel, which does not have the "View output"
button in the GRASS toolbox.

So, I ran the module, did the refresh, and QGIS crashed.

Then I tried several times, just doing refesh in the Browser, and it always
crashed after clicking 2 or 3 times on the refresh button. It was in those
attempts that I made the backtrace.

Then I ran QGIS with GRASS 6, and the crash did not happen. Finally I ran
QGIS with GRASS 7 again, and could not replay the crash.

So, may it be something with the GRASS plugin?


Thanks!

Pedro

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [QGIS-Processing] Define optional parameters in
	Script
Message-ID: <55E059CD.1080805@gmail.com>

Hi Victor,

I'm working on porting QGIS Processing to Web Processing Service, and I 
have found that all parameters in a QGIS Processing script are mandatory.
It would be useful to power define some parameters as optional.

I think that I can propose some code but I'd like to know what is your 
preferred way of defining optional parameters :
* an header line started by 'optional' with a list of parameter name 
separated by comma
##optional=SEGMENTS,DISTANCE
* an extra value at the end of the header line
##SEGMENTS=number 5 opt

Thanks

Hi Andreas,

I assume the libqtwebkit-dev package comes with the source code only and
that the same source code can be compiled against qt4 or qt5, so there
is no separate package (just guessing though).

It would be very valuable to have a stacktrace of the crash since that
would point out where the issue actually is located.

Regards,
Matthias

Hey,
some strange behaviour here (2.6) :

In a postgis layer over a postgis view
one of the view field is a boolean

I chose the checkbox for editing this field.
checked is "true", unchecked is "false" , without the quote signs.

When adding a new geometry, all works as intended, the row inserted into
the database is the correct one.

But when trying to get info about the geometry (arrow with the question
mark), it generates an error :

1 cursor states lost.

SQL:

DECLARE qgis_12 BINARY CURSOR FOR

SELECT st_asbinary("geom",'NDR')

   ,boolout("positionning_absolute")

   ,"gid"::text

   ,"type"::text

   ,"positionning_offset_type"::text

   ,"positionning_offset"::text

   ,"positionning_orientation_type"::text

   ,"positionning_orientation"::text

   ,"curv_dist"::text

FROM "street_amp"."editing_street_object"

WHERE boolout("positionning_absolute")='t'


R?sultat: 7 (

ERROR: operator does not exist: cstring = unknown

LINE 1: ...ng_street_object" WHERE boolout("positionning_absolute")='t'

^

HINT: No operator matches the given name and argument type(s). You might
need to add explicit type casts.

)


I don't understand the need to use the boolout function,

it works simply without it, and if you want to be extra sure,

you could cast the text to boolean safely (it is not necessary tough)


FROM "street_amp"."editing_street_object"

WHERE "positionning_absolute"='t'::boolean


Cheers,

R?mi-C

Note sure for te technical details, but instead of true/false, I have t

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Updating a layer when data changes
Message-ID: <CANVKczMgeZeyB_7C04_n49PW-69jy4QGx7ig6B5saxEEKU92XQ@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to make a layer redraw when the underlying data changes.
This seemed to work well in 2.8 but is very unreliable in 2.10.

I am trying to do the following:

 * create a point shapefile (from R) with a 'z' attribute having
values between 0 and 1
 * load into qgis, use a graduated renderer to colour points according to z
 * overwrite the shapefile with the same points but z set to 0.9 for all points
 *  *** wave magic wand *** points are now coloured for z=0.9 (dark blue)
 * overwrite the shapefile with the same points but z set to 0.1 for all points
 * *** wave magic wand *** points are now coloured for z=0.1 (white)


The trouble is the magic wand waving. Assorted StackOverflow posts and
mailing list threads point at:

 layer.triggerRepaint()
 layer.setCacheImage(None)
 layer.dataProvider().dataChanged.emit()

none, or all, of which seem to update the visible layer. Not even if I
drag and zoom a bit. Although sometimes, after a while doing nothing,
it updates. I can't figure out what's triggering it, and I'm fairly
sure the first two of the above worked well in 2.8 (have upgraded all
my 2.8s to 2.10s now...).

 I've deselected "Use render caching..." in the Rendering tab of the
Options dialog.

 The only reliable way of updating a layer I've found is to
right-click on the legend and "Duplicate", and then the duplicate
layer and the original both get drawn using the new z values from the
updated on-disk shapefile after toggling the legend visibility.

 So, I'm stuck. Apologies for cross-posting to GIS.SE:

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/159950/make-a-qgis-layer-update-from-a-changed-data-source

but you might want to comment/answer there if you crack it.

Not sure what's happened here, but it did trigger my memory to ask a
question I've been meaning to for a while...


What's the current plans for the 2.10 branch? While we have a definite
process regarding releases from the LTS 2.8 branch, is there any
follow-up 2.10 releases planned? Or given that we are closing in on
2.12 is there little point for a 2.10 release and hence no reason to
backport to that branch?

AFAIK DBManager doesn't check the query, so I suppose that the error comes
from the underlying database.

The general policy is not to do any 2.10.x releases unless there is a real show stopper issue that prevents general usage of the release.

Ok, far enough. Can we get some advance warning if such an issue is
identified prior to a release? Otherwise I won't bother backporting
fixes to 2.10 until this condition is triggered :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Night Mapping theme, changeset da3f7be
Message-ID: <20150830.101327.15117.0@webmail01.vgs.untd.com>

Hi Nathan, I just noticed the recent addition of UI themes / Night Mapping and how Qt stylesheets are used to implement it. This is a great idea, but there are a few things to be careful of. In particular, changing the theme to Night Mapping is OK, but changing back to 'default' causes QGis to crash, due to the stylesheet file referenced not existing. And the Style setting in options shows blank on first use of the new theme. Clicking OK on the Options (and possibly other actions) causes the WindowsVista (on my computer) style to be use on subsequent QGIS start. I had recently begun to try using stylesheets to set things, such as icon size, and have found some issues: + setting an invalid stylesheet may cause QGIS crash (when setting style after the stylesheet -- not a common practice, or even setting a defective stylesheet), so don't set something like 'file:///style.qss' if the file doesn't exist. + setting a stylesheet on application object hinders recovery of the style name as used in the Options dialog; probably should track the style as a text value and not recover from the style object. + using a stylesheet on the application object to set icon size, for example, seems a better idea to me than to program a specific set of controls to get the size as is done now. + in spite of Qt docs noting that setting style after QApplication object creation isn't recommended, I have done so successfully, except when there is a defective stylesheet present. + presently, the font and certain other settings applied by stylesheet are on the main window so only child windows get the styling. The stylesheet really should be set on the application so all windows of the app get the styling. + any stylesheet settings applied directly need to be integrated with any additional settings from a file. I not sure how to do both direct settings and include a file, too, at the present time. I am not well Internet connected right now, so it may be a while before I respond to any replies. Steven Mizuno

thanks for the clarification; did more checks, unclear when it happens.
all the best.

Hi, thanks for debugging, I think that the problem is real.

First two backtraces are identical, the third is different, but the
problem will be the same, a child item was probably deleted but
pointer to that item was left in children. Most probably it only
happens after some particular action in the browser, simple refresh
probably works. Do you remember what you had done before v.kernel and
refresh? For example: importing data via drag & drop, canceling
running import, renaming/deleting layers?

If you manage to get it crashed again (desirable), please send here
last few debug messages printed by QGIS, it should print the path to
an item it is refreshing, for example:

src/app/qgsbrowserdockwidget.cpp: 664: (refreshModel) [0ms] path =
favourites:/|home|radim|gdata|grass-plugin/grass:world_location_4326/import7/vector/polys

from the path, we could deduce at least for which item it happens.

The "View output" was missing because output of v.kernel may be both
vector and raster and so its type is not defined in interface
description. I added outputType attribute support and fixed
v.kernel.qgm.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Saving plugin's user data/settings
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_FohfzaaMedRFxLjy3-aNUT9_atc97me4AbnFmJqr7r9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

At a plugin project we have, a metadata editor, we save user recent files
and a contact list as json files in a folder, inside the plugin folder. It
works ok, until we update or reinstall the plugin, that wipes that
information.

Can someone provide information on how to (or where to) save plugin's user
data (like settings, last used files, etc...), so it doesn't vanish on
plugin updates or re-instalation?

I found this:
http://docs.qgis.org/testing/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/settings.html

But not sure if we can use it for what we need.

Thanks,

Alexandre Neto

Hi,

The problem is solved. It turned out, that I had the same problem back 
in 2012. Google revealed it:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-developer/2012-December/023819.html

I had to re-compile GDAL to use an external JPEG library, not the 
internal one - otherwise QGIS would crash on start. Strange, how these 
libraries interact ... The new startscreen seems to have displayed a 
JPEG file (just as the about screen). That's why QGIS crashed on these two.
