Hi Nicolas,
it seems to me this https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/52143 PR (which is 
awaiting for reviews) may be related to your questions.

Best regards.

Hi,

I just wanted to advertise that I'm working on builing python binding
for QGIS with Qt6/PyQt6 . It's here : https://github.com/troopa81/QGIS/tree/build_qt6_ci_pyqt

This is still draft, there is a lot of hacky stuff and commented code
but I managed to build bindings for all modules and run
sucessfully some tests (not all).

I hope I could propose a WIP PR by the end of the week so we could
discuss about this. 

Regards,
Julien

Thank you for the update.

I'm going to formalize the QT6 plan in the next PSC meeting tomorrow
and then I'll organize another meeting, probably during the hackfest
considering that there are Easter holidays in the middle.

Hi everyone,

Sorry to bother you but I have been trying to upload a model to the
QGIS web site for the last month. I have sent multiple email to the
developers group, logged a report  (Qgis model review unattended
#1141), sent an email to the site developer but without any response.
What can I do? Who can I contact to get my upgraded models approved?

Thanks
Nicolas

Hi all,

Thanks for working on this Julien.

I had good feedback from KDAB regarding QtWebEngine/Qt3D with the
recommendation to just copy or subclass Qt3DWindow to disable the offending
call that overwrites the default.

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Approval and Maintainer-Change of ORSTools-Plugin
Message-ID: <20230404152738.4f467bed@hgh0073>

Dear QGIS-devs,

not sure if this is the correct point of contact, but i couldn't find 
any information about plugin approval and maintainer changes on
https://plugins.qgis.org/. Please redirect me, if this is the wrong contact.

Our plugin (https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/ORStools/) had a change in 
the maintainer.
However there is no entry in the metadata.txt to change the maintainer 
displayed in the Details tab.

I did search quite a bit but couldn't find any solution to remove 
nilsnolde as a maintainer from the Details.

Is this probably saved somewhere internally on the website?
What would be the correct way to go about changing the maintainer?

Is the maintainer responsible for approving the plugin? If not, is there
anything that we can do to facilitate the process of approval?

Hope to hear from you.

Best regards,
Jakob

Hi,

Are you able to connect on the website ? https://plugins.qgis.org
Go in your plugin page, "Manage" tab, then "Edit", at the bottom, you can
edit the list of owners.

Hey,

thanks for your response.
Yes, we are able to edit our plugin details on https://plugins.qgis.org.

The list of owners there correctly has  "heigit" as the plugin owner.

This, however, doesn't seem to directly correspond to the information on the
plugin page itself, which states a Maintainer and Collaborators.

We'd like to change the Maintainer Information on the plugins page, since it's
no longer correct.

Best regards,
Jakob Schnell

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Call for nominations for new QGIS community voting
 member
Message-ID: <CAB2ZMRCvQpusTchFY7B90dTKAyKNZAiKtktaeYU7WozJS7Va6Q@mail.gmail.com>

Dear QGIS Community

In preparation for the 2023 AGM, we need to balance the country voting
members and the community voting members.


This is a call for nominations for 1 new QGIS community voting member.
Please read the instructions on the form carefully and establish your
eligibility to nominate which I repeat here for your convenience:

"Only community members with commit rights to an official QGIS git
repository or with write access in transifex are eligible to make
nominations.?

The nomination form is below and will close on 16.03.23.

https://forms.gle/Z29ogprv7EnKFhsF9

The Incoming community voting member will be selected based on the result
of the ballot following this nomination round.

If you play an organisational role (e.g. documentation lead, translation
lead), please forward this email to your committers.

If you have any questions about the process please do not hesitate to
contact me.

Thank you,

Regards Marco

Message-ID: <056373d0-d392-6b4f-434f-d51586373008@wheregroup.com>

Hi everyone,

I logged a lot of messages with QgsMessageLog.logMessage() and now the 
General tab in Log Messages says "Message log truncated".

Any new incoming message is not logged anymore at all.

How can I clear the message log so that new messages are displayed again?

Is there a way to make it a FIFO-ish log instead where older messages 
get discarded when necessary?

Cheers, Hannes

Dear QGIS enthusiasts

As some of you may be aware, we have been developing a space for users to
share their QML styles, processing models, 3D objects, etc.

You can find already a rich collection of great resources here:

https://plugins.qgis.org/ (open the 'Hub' menu up top).

It would be really great to have co-reviewers help me to deal with the new
submissions as they come in. If you are interested to help me, please let
me know and I will give you the access needed (I'll need your OSGEO id).

Thanks!

Regards

Tim

Hi Nicolas

Thanks for your note (and also thanks to Ale who is the one who actually
reviewed your models. Normally I get an email whenever a resource is added
or changed but unfortunately GMail somehow decided these were spam and I
wasn't getting the notifications. Hopefully that should be resolved now. If
you have any further issues please feel free to email me directly. For
platform improvements, can I invite you to create tickets here:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Django/issues

Regards

Tim

Hi Jakob

These are the things I can edit in the admin panel. I suspect you want to
change the 'created by' field? Please indicate the osgeo id of the person
it should be changed to.

Thanks

Oddly if I left click on the mouse the pan cursor comes back.  Seems like a refresh issue, but I refreshed the map an that did not work.  Oddly I also only have this issue if drawing a polygon.  If I draw a point of line, no issue.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Create layer, start edit session, commit and end edit session does not get me completely out of edit session and get my pan cursor back

I have written code that automatically creates an empty QgsVectorLayer, adds it to the layer panel; I add a call to vlayer.featureAdded.connect(self.check_size) on the created layer that starts an edit session as well as checks that my polygon is within a min and max size.  The user can then use QGIS edit tools to add the feature.  After one feature is added it commits the changes.  This tool is to just draw an AOI so I want to auto close the edit session.  Though the layer is no longer in edit mode, the edit bullseye cursor is still showing.  It seems the edit mode is still in play.  I can still draw on the canvas and the shaded polygon shows up as if I am in edit mode.  I don't get an error.  Why does not running  commitChanges() completely get me out of edit mode.  My fix sine I cannot figure this out is to run iface.actionPan().trigger() to get myself back in pan mode, but why does this not get done automatically.

If I use QGIS to create an empty layer, toggle editing on by selecting that option on the layer in the layer panel, add a feature, and then toggle editing off and select save when prompted, I get the pan cursor back and I am completely out of edit mode.  What code do I need to run to accomplish this in python? I basically just use startEditing and commitChanges to start and end an edit session.

Thanks,
Luke

My cursor displays as bullseye until I left click on the mouse.  I called

        iface.actionPan().trigger()

but it is only working when I initiate a left click.

Message-ID: <CAGy7cYmSMqZTMZp3EyvnOB6o0b4VBFh1UHN061YLwf79CHvx8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
I am compiling QGIS 3.28.5 with minor changes on Windows 10 system -->
running configonly.bat --> ninja and build compilation successful. After
ninja install, the QGIS files are install in OSGeo4W/apps/qgis-test and
qgis running quite successful from bin/qgis.exe.

Now I have create msi using https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W and replace my
QGIS app file with those which are created by
https://github.com/jef-n/OSGeo4W and win to create msi successfully. After
installation of that msi installer, QGIS gives the error.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Oops, looks like an error loading QGIS
Details:
Could not load qgis_app.dll
Windows Error : The specified module could not be found.
Help:
Check C:\Program Files\QGIS 3.28.5\bin\qgis-ltr-bin.env for correct
environment paths
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whereas if I create the whole setup with cmake-gui and do compilation on VS
2019 and generate msi installer everything runs fine. There is no issue at
all.

My question is why the ninja build compiled qgis is not running after every
successful process, i.e after creation of msi installer. Is there anything
which I am missing?

Hey Tim,

yeah, it looks like that's the setting influencing the `Maintainer` entry in
the plugin details.

Could you change that to "heigit"?
That would be much appreciated.

Could the "heigit" user also get the `plugins.can_approve`-permission mentioned
in the docs?? What would be the process to apply for said permission?

Best regards,
Jakob

Message-ID: <CADBCwLbw0kf1OxHBg+tecOdkr=Jh2hXn=+L0NU3iQ73Fe6snXA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,
lately, while building QGIS with any sip related change, some of the
triggered `sip-build` processes take too long to complete (two of them take
10 minutes, one takes 15' and one takes 25' roughly)
Is this normal or is it some quirk on my setup? (Debian testing, sip 6.7.7)

Thanks,
Stefanos

I want to be able to track the mouse movement so I can calculated the area of the feature being drawn in real time so I can make sure the area is within a defined range.

Is there an event I can connect to so I can run my custom code when the even occurs?

So I declared my class as AoiSizeValidator(QgsMapToolEmitPoint)



But gave that a try and it gets me x,y, initially but when I select an add layer from the qgis edit menu, I guess it sets a new map tool so mine gets overridden.  So looks like I need a different approach to get xy from the map canvas.

Hi,

While working on building QGIS python binding with SIP 6/PyQT6, it seems
to me that it takes more time than my classic setup (SIP 4.19.25/PyQT
5.15.7) but no as much as you describe.

You can try to downgrade your SIP version. I'm also on debian testing
and current python3-sip version is 4.19.25). Did you install it with
pip?

Regards,
Julien

This matches my findings -- sip 6 is much slower than sip 4.

That said, ~10 minutes to build is dramatically longer than I see on
sip 6. On 6.6.2 the sip builds might take ~30 seconds for me. (Fedora

Thanks for the feedback!

Apparently, I had both sip 4.19.25 and sip-tools 6.7.7 installed which was
possibly causing the slowness.
I brought build times back to normal by doing the following:

- remove all sip-tools 6.7.7 related packages
- install the missing sip-dev package
- delete the SIP_BUILD_EXECUTABLE entry in ccmake
- when configuring, QSCI_SIP_DIR was populated instead
- generate
- delete the build/python/ directory
- ninja

Regards,
Stefanos

Message-ID: <CAGy7cYn4f_2Af-9UvrY=S4uDdVsPWqVrYa507+RHQ25OVf9uhA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Greetings to QGIS developers

While creating msi for qgis-ltr or qgis-ltr-dev, some of the packages are
not downloading such as grass, saga and many others.

They are downloading only when changes are made to qgis-full in createmsi.pl

For creating qgis-ltr, how to get grass and saga, what chages are
required? @J?rgen
E. Fischer <jef at norbit.de> had helped me earlier also. Thanks.

Regards

Paul N

What changes?  saga and grass are optional dependencies not included in
qgis-ltr and qgis-ltr-dev.  You should use qgis-ltr-full or qgis-ltr-dev-full.

I wrote a custom function that accesses the area of the feature and adjusts the label accordingly.   After I clicked on Save and Load Function I see my functions category and the functions and can use them in the expression tab, but when I close QGIS and start it again, the function is not automatically loaded.  I have to go to the layer properties and open the expression assigned in the label properties and click Save and Load Function and select apply/ok.  This is not gonna work for me since I need this to work automatically so when I create an installer for my software this function works for everyone.

on what info is useful in a bug report. Did you try it in a new profile?

Cheers, Hannes

Hi,

an in addition to Hannes you should check the python expression folder 
in your profile folder:

  * goto "Settings"->"User Profiles"->"Open Active Profile Folder"
  * and then check the subfolder \python\expressions
  * there should be your python expression function as python file

Best regards

Stefan

Hello,

Here is a snipped of code that can help you.
To test this you have to:
- Show python console
- enable the polygonal digitizing tool (must be the active tool before 
launching this snippet)
- execute the code in the python editor
- start digitizing
- see the area printing in the console

Don't hesitate if you have further questions.

Regards,

Thanks for your response. Now it works. I was using qgis-ltr instead of
qgis-ltr-full in createmsi.pl

Many many thanks ?.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Fwd: Question about a plugin. POC attached.
In-Reply-To: <CAJUsHwXEbDCTu=ZvSs41Ja__-sB6+xeow-0+hSPM1zS4E4r31A@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings to QGIS developers,

I would greatly appreciate it if someone could check if the attached plugin
complies with the licenses compared to the imported modules.

In this specific attached plugin, all the source code is open, but the
question is: what if it comes with the following file:
*'djangorest/include/djangorest_compiled.py'* really compiled as a .pyd
file? Would it violate the GPL license terms or is it just enough to be
considered as an acceptable external process?

The .pyd will just import QgsTask from qgis.core and use a session_path
received as a text created by the open source part of the plugin
using QgsProcessingUtils.

The attached one is a very simple plugin made for this demonstration, you
can click on the button, just type google.it, and it will download the 404
page found ( because it appends some string that google doesn't serve as
content ). For user and password fields: just type anything, they are not
used in the POC but there's still a check active on fields population.
The only action the plugin will do is just a single pycurl GET request to
the address specified.

Any advice will be appreciated.
Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Temporarily disable map canvas right click showing
 Copy Coordinates
Message-ID: <87acab2e1b4b4d28b55aca183853f963@erdc.dren.mil>

I have an event filter on the map canvas that performs a commit during feature editing when right clicking on the canvas.  While this performs the commit, it then pops up Copy Coordinates.  I don't want the user to see this.  I want my mouse click event to be recognized and not have QGIS use it to popup the Copy Coordinates.  Is there a way to call QgsMapTool.deactivate on that built in tool just for this instance and then reactivate it?

Are you using a custom QgsMapTool subclass? If so, implement the
"flags" method and don't return the ShowContextMenu flag.

I am not using QgsMapTool.

T o capute mouse events, I declared my class as 

class AoiSizeValidator(QWidget):

And added 

def eventFilter(self, source, event):

with code that captures mouse click events.

I tried using 

        iface.mapCanvas().setContextMenuPolicy(Qt.NoContextMenu)

and

        iface.mapCanvas().setContextMenuPolicy(Qt.PreventContextMenu)

But it did not work. I found that suggestion on a site where someone was looking to disable the context menu for QWebEngineView, so thought it would work for the map canvas.

I did find half a solution by setting

        iface.mapCanvas().contextMenuAboutToShow.connect(self.disable_context_menu)

    def disable_map_canvas_context_menu(self, menu: QMenu, event: QgsMapMouseEvent):
        	menu.clear()

which basically completely clears the context menu from all its widgets, but I would like he menu back after my right click event happens to end the edit session.

I thought I tried this before and it still showed the menu with its menu grayed out, but maybe I set it on the submenu item, but I solved my issue by calling 

menu.setDisabled(True) on the QMenu.  I reset it to False after my editing is done so the context menu is available again.  

If anyone thinks of a better way feel free to answer, but this will work for now.  I was hoping the setContextMenuPolicy methd would work.

Others maybe can confirm or test?

Maybe return True in your eventFilter, so that the event is not

Hi,

The budget for the QT6 research/migration work was approved, I was
thinking of organizing a meeting  next week on the 20th or 21st around
11:00am local time (The Netherlands).

Many of us will be able to attend in person but I will try to set up a
remote connection.

Any preference on the date?

Hi

I havent looked at your code, but perhaps you could add to your original
message an explanation of why you don't just distribute it as a py /
uncompiled python source file?

Regards

Tim

Dear Tim,

It seems that 99% of developers were asking themselves the same question
and hesitated to examine the code.

Regardless, I think it's already good to have shared this small proof of
concept with the community, demonstrating an integration between Django and
QGIS, especially considering that it has been implemented with a rather
robust certificate verification mechanism.

So, rest assured, my question does not hide an intention contrary to GPL
policy, but I remain curious to understand the boundary between a process
considered external and a process considered internal to QGIS, and
therefore subject to the same GPL license. If I ever present a project to a
client, I would like to be able to tell them that I applied a defense
mechanism (albeit simple, such as compilation) to prevent the leakage of
endpoints called by the REST APIs.

However, I think I have answered myself: after researching the issue
online, I found that calling QGSTask in a function is considered an
internal process to QGIS and thus subject to GPL. The subsequent question
that emerged and that I still cannot answer is: would it be acceptable if
only the run() function or a subsequent function were compiled, just enough
to close the REST parameters? There probably isn't a definitive answer;
could that portion of code be considered an extension of pycurl+certifi?
Maybe yes, maybe no. It matters little, I guess.

Thank you for the time you spent writing this request for clarification.

Best regards,


Giordano Cetti

Hi Alessandro

A meeting for qt6 migration would be useful... My personal preference would
be for 20th as I will be leaving on 21st already and I would probably miss
it...

Cheers
Martin

Ok, let's do it the 20th. 11:00am local time.

I'll find a room and post a jitsi link for remote attendees.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QgsProjectStyleSettings styles.db remain open
 after QgsProject::clear()
Message-ID: <CAEMrtYpj08mLbf=drxKF-0rMKzirh3dguU0u=LAjXphi4HHeVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
with Qgis 3.28.3 called from Python, whenever QgsProject::clear() is
called it creates new styles.db file, previous styles file is deleted
from system, but it remains open (listed by lsof). It becomes a
problem in server environment where every call to QgsProject::clear()
creates a new file and limit of open files is soon reached.

Just reading the code I was not able to trace down where / which
object remains referenced. Maybe QgsStyle.mCurrentDB should be closed
explicitly?

Is it OK to use this workaround?:
project = QgsProject(None, Qgis.ProjectCapabilities())
QgsProject.setInstance(project)

BTW, how can I modify QgsProject.capabilities() from Python?

It will only get freed when the event loop is next executed.

You can safely execute the event loop with DeferredDelete to only cleanup
of this object without the danger of other event loop mess.

That doesn't have any better options.  I'm traveling in the morning to Den
Bosch and probably will arrive shortly after 1300.

I'm sorry but this is the best I can do: Nyall & friends are not
available in our afternoon and I have a workshop plus Martin is not
here on the 21st (and he spoke first).

Maybe you will be able to attend remotely?

I think we will be able to update you in person anyway.

Talk to you soon!

According to the wiki he's leaving at 12 on the 21th.  So there might still be
be options on friday too.

No idea.  I'll be on the train.

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Outdated WebKit engine version in QGIS
Message-ID: <AS1PR04MB95823B43884FAD5E74475AADE9629@AS1PR04MB9582.eurprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

I have been using WebKit engine from the PyQt library built in QGIS 3.30 when developing QGIS plugin in Python to load web pages directly in QGIS. The Webkit engine used seems to be very outdated and not possible to render modern web pages. For example, the engine used in QGIS 3.30 dated back to 2016: AppleWebKit/602.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) QGIS3 Version/10.0 Safari/602.1.

Is there any chance to update the built-in Webkit engine version in next release of QGIS ?
Otherwise, can the WebKit engine be updated locally and provided to the application ?
Does QGIS offer any other built-in alternatives, like the Qt WebEngine or other web engine with python bindings ?

Thank you,
Minh

It's an extremely messy and painful situation, but ultimately the
answer is NO. There's no alternative, no way of updating the webkit
version used by QtWebkit, and Qt Webengine CANNOT be used as it stands
in QGIS.

Hi,

If Qt Webengine is in QGIS why it cannot be used ? Is there maybe any Qgs class that uses Qt Webengine internally and can be reused ?

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pyqgis how to append existing gpkg layer
Message-ID: <PR1P264MB2046D7E56C97ED21E6FC71769C629@PR1P264MB2046.FRAP264.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi dev and users

I don't understand how to append an existing gpkg layer with pyqgis.
I've tried many QgsVectorFileWriter options

self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.CreateOrOverwriteLayer

reset final layer

And
self.options.EditionCapability = QgsVectorFileWriter.CanAppendToExistingLayer

does not change anything

So what's the good way to do this ?

This is my code (I'm iterating over several other data sources)
        self.options = QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions()
        self.options.driverName = 'GPKG'
        self.options.onlySelectedFeatures = True
        self.options.layerName = 'parcelles'

        for dir in dirs:
            print(dir)

            if os.path.isdir(dir):
                db_GPKG = os.path.join(dir, 'MAEC2023.gpkg')
                if os.path.exists(db_GPKG):
                    gpkg_layer = db_GPKG + "|layername=parcelles"
                    RPG_layer = QgsVectorLayer(gpkg_layer, "RPG", "ogr")

                    expr = (' "fk_mesure" is not null ')
                    #expr = ('"fk_mesure" = \'{}\'').format('MAEC Papillons')

                    RPG_layer.selectByExpression(expr)
                    selected_feature = RPG_layer.selectedFeatures()
                    print(len(selected_feature))
                    if os.path.exists(self.db_GPKG): # if the ouput file already exist
                        self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.CreateOrOverwriteLayer
                        #self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerNoNewFields
                        #self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerAddFields
                        self.options.EditionCapability = QgsVectorFileWriter.CanAppendToExistingLayer
                    else:
                        self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.CreateOrOverwriteFile

                    write_result, error_message = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormatV2(RPG_layer, self.db_GPKG , self.context, self.options)



Thanks

Hi there,

Following this work, Benjamin Jakimow (developer of the ENMap-Box) and I 
worked on a plugin that introduces a resource browser right into QGIS:

  * plugin page <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/pyqgis_resource_browser/>
  * source code <https://github.com/Guts/qgis-plugin-resource-browser>

The logic is mainly an extraction of the resource browser that already 
existed in dev tools of ENMap-Box 
<https://www.enmap.org/data_tools/enmapbox/> (full credit to Benjamin) 
dropped into a boilerplate generated from the QGIS Plugin Templater 
<https://oslandia.gitlab.io/qgis/template-qgis-plugin/> (presented in 
Firenze 
<https://jmoura.pages.oslandia.io/presentations/2022/foss4g_qgis_plugin_development_sota.html>).

Hope it can helps, if so enjoy!

Happy contributor/user meeting!

Regards,
Julien

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Pyqgis how to append existing gpkg layer
In-Reply-To: <PR1P264MB2046D7E56C97ED21E6FC71769C629@PR1P264MB2046.FRAP264.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Bonjour Sylvain,

J'esp?re que vous allez bien.


If you want to append features from a source layer to another layer that
already exists in a GPKG file, you can do this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
options = QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions()
options.driverName = "GPKG"
options.layerName = "my_existing_layer_name"  *# Write here the existing
layer name in the GPKG*
options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerNoNewFields
options.onlySelectedFeatures = True

path = "/tmp/existing_gpkg_file_path.gpkg"
layer = QgsVectorLayer("/tmp/my_source_layer.shp", "my source layer name",
"ogr")

result = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormatV3(
    layer,
    path,  *# Existing GPKG file path*
    layer.transformContext(),
    options)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If on the contrary, you want to append a whole layer (with its own field
structure, crs, etc.) to an existing GPKG database, you can follow this
solution:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/417950


As you can see, the key is to define the options.actionOnExistingFile
property, whose possible values are well documented here:

https://api.qgis.org/api/3.28/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#afda86eff21ac1da7dc42cbdde424acb1


*Note: SInce we're using writeAsVectorFormatV3(), you need at least QGIS
v3.20 for this solution to work.*


Regards,

Germ?n

It's not in QGIS. It's in Qt, but can't be used from QGIS. QtWebengine
requires some initialization steps before construction of the
QApplication used by QGIS, and unfortunately these steps introduce an
incompatibility in OpenGL handling which breaks the QGIS 3D
functionality.

Pending an upstream Qt / Webengine fix we can't resolve this
situation, and Qt Webengine is not a possibility for use in QGIS.

Hi Germ?n,

options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerNoNewFields

Was the key. Thanks !

Bonjour Sylvain,

J'esp?re que vous allez bien.


If you want to append features from a source layer to another layer that already exists in a GPKG file, you can do this:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
options = QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions()
options.driverName = "GPKG"
options.layerName = "my_existing_layer_name"  # Write here the existing layer name in the GPKG
options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerNoNewFields
options.onlySelectedFeatures = True

path = "/tmp/existing_gpkg_file_path.gpkg"
layer = QgsVectorLayer("/tmp/my_source_layer.shp", "my source layer name", "ogr")

result = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormatV3(
    layer,
    path,  # Existing GPKG file path
    layer.transformContext(),
    options)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If on the contrary, you want to append a whole layer (with its own field structure, crs, etc.) to an existing GPKG database, you can follow this solution:

https://gis.stackexchange.com/a/417950


As you can see, the key is to define the options.actionOnExistingFile property, whose possible values are well documented here:

https://api.qgis.org/api/3.28/classQgsVectorFileWriter.html#afda86eff21ac1da7dc42cbdde424acb1


Note: SInce we're using writeAsVectorFormatV3(), you need at least QGIS v3.20 for this solution to work.


Regards,

Germ?n

Hi dev and users

I don?t understand how to append an existing gpkg layer with pyqgis.
I?ve tried many QgsVectorFileWriter options

self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.CreateOrOverwriteLayer

reset final layer

And
self.options.EditionCapability = QgsVectorFileWriter.CanAppendToExistingLayer

does not change anything

So what?s the good way to do this ?

This is my code (I?m iterating over several other data sources)
        self.options = QgsVectorFileWriter.SaveVectorOptions()
        self.options.driverName = 'GPKG'
        self.options.onlySelectedFeatures = True
        self.options.layerName = 'parcelles'

        for dir in dirs:
            print(dir)

            if os.path.isdir(dir):
                db_GPKG = os.path.join(dir, 'MAEC2023.gpkg')
                if os.path.exists(db_GPKG):
                    gpkg_layer = db_GPKG + "|layername=parcelles"
                    RPG_layer = QgsVectorLayer(gpkg_layer, "RPG", "ogr")

                    expr = (' "fk_mesure" is not null ')
                    #expr = ('"fk_mesure" = \'{}\'').format('MAEC Papillons')

                    RPG_layer.selectByExpression(expr)
                    selected_feature = RPG_layer.selectedFeatures()
                    print(len(selected_feature))
                    if os.path.exists(self.db_GPKG): # if the ouput file already exist
                        self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.CreateOrOverwriteLayer
                        #self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerNoNewFields
                        #self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.AppendToLayerAddFields
                        self.options.EditionCapability = QgsVectorFileWriter.CanAppendToExistingLayer
                    else:
                        self.options.actionOnExistingFile = QgsVectorFileWriter.CreateOrOverwriteFile

                    write_result, error_message = QgsVectorFileWriter.writeAsVectorFormatV2(RPG_layer, self.db_GPKG , self.context, self.options)



Thanks

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] QGIS Edit Menu detect selection
Message-ID: <98db043cb3b749b29ebbb2d6a6c0f6bc@erdc.dren.mil>

Is there a way to detect the selection of the edit menu?  I have a eventFilter on the map canvas that works great with a rectangle.  It detects the left mouse press to get the start point and as the mouse is moved, it calculates the area of the rectangle and if within a certain range will complete the polygons shape and save to the layer when the user right clicks on the map canvas.

I want the user to be able to draw other shapes allowed such as multisided polygons, circles, etc, so I want to be able to calculate the area of those shapes.  In order to do that I nee to detect what the user selected in the edit menu.

Looking to add two icons to the QGIS Layer Panel that would access custom code to sort the layers. I already have the code.  It's not a simple geometry type or alphabetical sort but I'm all set with that code anyway.  I just want to add icons into the layer panel.

I found this site that shows how to modify the menus:

https://courses.spatialthoughts.com/pyqgis-in-a-day

But I am looking to access the dock widget and add two icons in its row of icons or maybe a menu.

Thanks in advance for any help,
Luke

It's not available via the stable API, but let's not let that stop us! ?

layer_tree = iface.layerTreeView()
layer_tree_dock = layer_tree.parent().parent()
toolbar = layer_tree_dock.findChildren(QToolBar)[0]

my_action = QAction('something')
toolbar.addAction(my_action)

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Backward compatibility for style in project files
 between QGIS versions
Message-ID: <67ecb8bab8b5fc0a9eccfb502a49e149@developpement-durable.gouv.fr>

Hello all

A polygon layer saved in a project file with QGIS 3.28 systematically
opens in blue in QGIS 3.16 (style is lost).

There has been a change in the way style is saved in project files
introduced in QGIS 3.22.

QGIS 3.22 seems to save the style in both formats (<Opt (<Option.../>)

and <prop k=.../>)

(see attachment)

This is no longer the case in QGIS 3.28.

We have a heterogeneous QGIS version park. The lack of style backward
compatibility is a major constraint on the gradual migration of our
services to QGIS 3.28.

We could consider developing or having a plugin developed to provide
this backward compatibility.
Is this possible? What would be the best way to go about it? Can we find
documentation on storing styles in QGIS project files and their
evolution?
(I haven't found anything on the web).

A possible solution might be to automate the QGIS 3.28 -> QGIS 3.16
conversion using QGIS 3.22.
What do you think about this? What is the best way to do it?

Best regards

Hi 

A polygon layer saved in a project file with QGIS 3.28 is systematically
opened in blue in QGIS 3.16 (the style is lost). 

There has been a change in the storage of style in project files
introduced in QGIS 3.22.

(see the attachment) 

This is no longer the case in QGIS 3.28 

We have a heterogeneous QGIS version park. The non backward
compatibility of style is an important brake to migrate progressively
our services to QGIS 3.28 

We could consider developing or having developed a plugin to ensure this
backward compatibility.
Is this possible? What would be the best way to proceed? Can we find
documentation on the storage of styles in QGIS project files and on its
evolution?
(I didn't find anything relevant by searching on the internet). 

Sincerely,

Hi,

We have remarked such breaking compatibility format problem. The more
annoying for us being the layout style, with font format being lost, so we
have to correct everything. I planned to inspect the file as you did, your
work will be useful.

Thank you !

You should have a look at the QAction documentation :
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qaction.html
The first parameter, you can give a QIcon.
For some predefined icon in QGIS, you can look to
https://pyqgis-icons-cheatsheet.geotribu.fr/

Another user posted this solution to add an icon. I tried it, but not getting any additional icon showing up in the layer?s panel..


toolbar = iface.mainWindow().findChild(QDockWidget, "Layers").findChild(QToolBar)

Then you can just add QAction to this toolbar :

my_wonderful_action = QAction(QIcon("path/to/icon.svg"), "Description (text menu or action tooltip)")
my_wonderful_action.triggered.connect(my_awesome_processing_function)
toolbar.addAction(my_wonderful_action)

It's not available via the stable API, but let's not let that stop us! ?

layer_tree = iface.layerTreeView()
layer_tree_dock = layer_tree.parent().parent()
toolbar = layer_tree_dock.findChildren(QToolBar)[0]

my_action = QAction('something')
toolbar.addAction(my_action)

This working for me

layer_tree = iface.layerTreeView()

layer_tree_dock = layer_tree.parent().parent()

toolbar = layer_tree_dock.findChildren(QToolBar)[0]

def my_function():

 ??? print("ook")

my_icon = QIcon("D:\Frequency.svg")

my_tooltip = "Description (text menu or action tooltip)"

my_action = QAction(my_icon, my_tooltip)

my_action.triggered.connect(my_function)

toolbar.addAction(my_action)

# toolbar.removeAction(my_action)

Best Regards

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Best practice for plugins including processing
 models
Message-ID: <CAF6hL+W2fbWRHcwJZ7Z9_-G1PhK+pwpYJPLDRdXeti0skP27MQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I maintain an in-house plugin for our team of civil engineers, who
apart from myself are not very advanced GIS users.
It does things like set useful defaults and install a set of useful
plugins.  It also includes some processing models, which are loaded with
the code below, which seems to be the conventional way models are loaded in
publicly available plugins which ship processing models.  This code copies
the model files included in the plugin to the default folder for processing
models - somewhere like
%AppData%\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\processing\models

One of my colleagues did some QGIS training and created a processing model,
which coincidentally had the same filename as a model I created on the same
day, so his model got overwritten when my plugin was updated.  This is not
a problem for us as we are a small team and can be careful what we do going
forward.  But it highlights that the way plugin authors are loading model
files is what seems to me to be pretty poor practice, for two reasons.

Firstly models are available in qgis even when the plugin is unloaded or
uninstalled, which is probably not desirable.
It is trivial to implement an unloadModels function to rectify this, and I
have done so in my in-house plugin.  I'm wondering - should plugin authors
be encouraged to do the same?

Secondly, loading the plugin will silently overwrite any existing models
with the same filename, as occurred here.  Plugins generally contain models
with fairly special filenames, so hopefully this is unlikely to occur,
unless:
- someone produces a plugin that is a fork of another one, or
- someone ships a plugin with a model that is previously publicly available
somewhere else, or that was created by following an online tutorial, or
- a user edits a model provided by a plugin.
In any case, would it be a good idea to encourage plugin authors to load
models another way, without copying them into
%AppData%\Roaming\QGIS\QGIS3\profiles\default\processing\models?
I realise that to change an existing plugin there is the added complication
of what to do when updating from an old version - the only safeish way I
can think of to automatically clean up obsolete model files would be to
check for them and then use a checksum to verify whether they should be
deleted.
For what it's worth, I note that when a user tries to manually "add model
to toolbox", QGIS refuses if there is an existing model with the same
filename.

Thanks.


    def loadModels(self):
            '''Register models present in models folder of the plugin.'''

Message-ID: <CAB28AshTnoGerghRQzaJKcYpHsSr0mhGFbxuc7trXiD2UCY_2Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi lists,

Just a quick PSA: If you're using QGIS (or any Qt based app), I recommend
avoiding an upgrade to any gnome 44 based distribution for now.

You'll get hit with this nasty bug:
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/mutter/-/issues/2715 which breaks drag and
drop functionality in all Qt applications. And in the process, basically
makes QGIS unusable... ?

You've been warned!

Ooh, tricky! Thanks Nyall for this heads up!

Was 44 already released actually?

As Debian testing/sid is now in something-freeze (and on 43).. I do not think it will enter 44 before release of Bookworm..?
So at least Debianista's are good untill that.

Reading the issue, I see it's about Qt5 AND Qt6, and there seems to be some work-around running applications in native Wayland mode (but in that QGIS has other issues...)

Hope this will be fixed soon...

Regards,

Richard

Hi Alain,

Yes, the backward compatibility to 3.16 has been removed in 3.28,
considering there was a LTR in between and that 3.16 was not maintained for
more than a year.

The PR is here https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/45143

I am not sure if it's possible to do it with a plugin.
An approach would be to revert this in the 3.28 branch to give more time. I
have no strong opinion here. The main motivation to drop compatibility was
the size of the project file and redundancy of information (manually
editing the file gets harder).

Denis

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Understanding QGIS Raster Calculator
Message-ID: <CANrMvRP5v3ofY6TLK0FGp6RGVut-vOjRj5jaMcUjbnXL+FPs6g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have been digging in the source code and am trying to understand how the
raster calculator works. From following the function calls through
QgisApp::showRasterCalculator() at line 6058, I understand that the calc
params are passed as an encoded URI, but I can't for the life of me figure
out where these params end up getting applied to a new layer. I am
particularly interested in how the formulaString is applied. Can someone
point me in the right direction?

Thanks,

Sunni

Subject: [QGIS-Developer] Digitizing with Edit Menu
Message-ID: <d0ec9cbf412043d4968b1aaf6fa5ec5a@erdc.dren.mil>

When you digitize a shape using the Edit menu in QGIS is the shape accessible?  I am looking to get he area of the shape as it is drawn.  I have added an event filter to my code to capture the coordinates and calculate it by creating a QgsGeometry, but my code is getting complicated as there are many shapes that a user can draw from this menu so if I can get access to this shape if it is temporary in memory, then I can just calculate the area on the shape and not have to capture all the positions of the mouse when clicked and moved.

Have you considered listening to the featureAdded signal instead?
The digitizing shape (aka rubberband) you see while digitizing is not
really accessible. In fact, it isn't guaranteed to be the geometry of the
feature being created. It could even not exist at all ; this is all
dependent on the current QgsMapTool used.

Rather than monitoring clicks, or accessing the rubberband, you could
listen to the featureAdded signal. This signal is emitted when a new
feature is added to the layer. You can then perform your check (e;g area
validation), and delete the feature if the check fails. It won't even
appear on screen.

Here is a possible implementation. Note that I split the AreaValidator into
three classes for genericity, but you could merge these three classes in a
single one.

LayerConnector : this is used to automatically connect all map layers to a
function
FeatureValidator: Specialization, connects all QgsVectorLayer featureAdded
signal to a function that takes the layer and the feature being added as
parameters
AreaValidator: Contains the actual area computation, and possible deletion
of the feature


class LayerConnector(QObject):
    """Generic class to connect to all QgsMapLayer"""

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        QgsProject.instance().layerWasAdded.connect(self.connect_layer)
        self.connect_layers()

    def __del__(self):
        QgsProject.instance().layerWasAdded.disconnect(self.connect_layer)
        self.disconnect_layers()

    def connect_layers(self):
        print("Connecting")
        for layer in QgsProject.instance().mapLayers().values():
            self.connect_layer(layer)

    def disconnect_layers(self):
        print("DisConnecting")
        for layer in QgsProject.instance().mapLayers().values():
            self.disconnect_layer(layer)

    def connect_layer(self, layer):
        pass

    def disconnect_layer(self, layer):
        pass


class FeatureValidator(LayerConnector):
    """Connect all QgsVectorLayer to a process_feature method when a
feature is added"""

    def connect_layer(self, layer):
        if not isinstance(layer, QgsVectorLayer):
            return
        layer.featureAdded.connect(self.on_feature_added)

    def disconnect_layer(self, layer):
        if not isinstance(layer, QgsVectorLayer):
            return
        layer.featureAdded.disconnect(self.on_feature_added)

    def on_feature_added(self, id):
        layer = self.sender()
        feat = layer.getFeature(id)
        self.process_feature(layer, feat)

    def process_feature(self, layer, feature):
        print(f"Feature {feature.id()} added to layer {layer.name()}")


class AreaValidator(FeatureValidator):
    def __init__(self, max_area):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_area = max_area

    def process_feature(self, layer, feature):
        geom = feature.geometry()
        if not geom:
            return

        # Here you should handle CRS transformation
        # before computing the feature area
        area = geom.area()

        if area > self.max_area:
            iface.messageBar().pushWarning("Cannot add feature", f"Area too
big : {round(area, 2)}")
            layer.deleteFeature(feature.id())


validator = AreaValidator(500)
