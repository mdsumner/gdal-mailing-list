>From the point of view of SEXTANTE, I like the idea of having a
library that other developers can use to get access to the sharing
platform. Just make sure that the library is well-documented and to
provide an example case for a given resource, so other people can use
that as a model to implement the same functionality from their own
resources.

In the case of SEXTANTE, models, script and R scripts look like the
most interesting ones to share, and if the library is ready and
working fine, that could be directly implemented in the SEXTANTE
toolbox, so it can be populateed with resources from the sharing
platform.

Feel free to ask me in case you want more information about this, so
as to have a good overview of what we users of your library would like
to have to make our work easier.

Keep up the good work!

Cheers
Victor

Hi,
      While running the QGIS in RHEL error is coming even after successful
compilation of qgis.

qgis:error while loading shared libraries: libqwt.so.6:cannot open shared
object file:No such file or directory.
         But qwt6.0 is successfully installed in my pc in the bath
/usr/local/qwt-6.0. And same path I have passed to "cmake" for
compiling the qgis1.8.
Guide me.

Thanks,
Sugandha

Hi,

Is anyone still working on the icons or can the iconset be considered

Oh, I hadn't seen that , sorry for the noise. 
I think, we maybe will have to describe it in docs, and why not add a startup tooltip. Not sure users will guess that alone. 
Drag 'n Drop inside the same browser would be convenient for the future (with a drodown menu asking if user want to copy or move files after drag and drop action..)
Nothing urgent anyway.

Drag and Drop already works in the same browser for importing into the
different database types e.g drag a shp file into postgis and it will
import.

I'm not seeing this. My WFS is GeoServer 2.3.4. I've tried several layers
and they're all showing the right feature count.
Are you certain it's the client that's skipping?

The issue about I originally filed the ticket was against qgis server,
not geoserver or mapserver.

So, moving file to file and database to file is missing within one browser ? .. maybe interesting for 2.1 - 2.2 ..

Drag and Drop already works in the same browser for importing into the different database types e.g drag a shp file into postgis and it will import.

Drag 'n Drop inside the same browser would be convenient for the future (with a drodown menu asking if user want to copy or move files after drag and drop action..)
Nothing urgent anyway.

Having two browsers just allows to d&d between to distant points in the tree
without having to scroll back an forth.

File to File or Database to file is missing for anything. Having two
browser is useful for dragging a file into a database if you are deep
within a folder tree.  Doing this with one browser is a pain.

I have some ideas on how to improve this in 2.1 and 2.2

I have to say I also got confused at first when I have seen "Browser
(2)". Maybe it would be more sensible to allow horizontal split within
the browser panel in order to get two independent views (a feature
common in various text editors).

Hello,

Thank you for the ideas. And Borys, your idea does make me question a
lot of things and the approach I have taken. As far as the symbols go,
I think I am on the right side with server side filtering. But when we
move towards more complicated stuff with votes, and versioning, it
does makes sense to have a local cache of meta-data to do the
filtering. I guess I will have to think more about this and figure out
the distinction and the way through it. Thank you for giving me the
other way to do.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] update plugin to QGIS 2.0
Message-ID: <20130801185856.072727fa@gbdlaptop.speedport.ip>

Hi,

I want to update a plugin from 1.8 to QGIS 2.0 and it throws following error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
File
  
"/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",  
line 447, in printValue self.showValues() File

line 453, in showValues self.plot() File
  
"/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",  
line 514, in plot w = float(self.sampleRaster(self.InRastW.currentText(),
self.xCoord, self.yCoord))/10 File
  
"/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",  
line 299, in sampleRaster return self.sampleRaster20(layer, x, y) File
  
"/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",  
line 284, in sampleRaster20 success, data =
layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y))

TypeError:
QgsRasterDataProvider.identify(QgsPoint, QgsRaster.IdentifyFormat,
QgsRectangle theExtent=QgsRectangle(), int theWidth=0, int theHeight=0):
not enough arguments

I found at http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/API_changes_for_version_20
the section QgsRasterDataProvider which should fit. And the Method, where I
assume the error occurs should be this

# get value at mouse position QGIS <= 1.8 (working for 1.8)
def sampleRaster18(self, layer, x, y):
   success, data = layer.identify(QgsPoint(x,y))
   for band, value in data.items():
     return value

now what I tried but doesn't work (see error above)

# get value at mouse position QGIS >= 2.0 (not working yet :()
def sampleRaster20(self, layer, x, y):
   success, data = layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y))
   for band, value in data.items():
     return value

my problem is, that I don't understand how to implement in sampleRaster20
the new method from the API_changes_for_version_20 website which says:

QMap<int, QVariant> identify( const QgsPoint & thePoint, IdentifyFormat
theFormat, const QgsRectangle &theExtent = QgsRectangle(), int theWidth =
0, int theHeight = 0 )

can anybody help?

Thanks 

Otto

I'm confused, looking at http://hub.qgis.org/projects , almost
everything is projects/name

Did something change? Were these all supposed to be sub-projects of
user-plugins?

Thanks,

Hi otto,

A super wild guess: whats the value of IdentifyFormat in your call?

Hth,

Have a look at the source of the value tool plugin, it calls the identify()
method and has been updated to 2.0 api.

Hi Denis,

It was great work on some of the icons you did recently(particularly the add
layer icons)..

I am on the side of replacing the topology checker icon..I did that while
playing with Inkscape :)
please consider it if you have time..

This is a known bug: new projects go to top level, opening them and saving they go
back to their appropriate level.
More generally, our Redmine needs some love.
All the best.

Hi,

thanks for your hints, I think I am on the right track now. I had a look at
the value tool plugin and tried to adapt the method accordingly:

def sampleRaster20(self, layer, x, y):
   #success, data = layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y))
   success, data = layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y),QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue).results() 
   for band, value in data.items(): 
      return value

But now I get another error message 

 File
 "/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",
 line 448, in printValue self.showValues() File
 "/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",
 line 454, in showValues self.plot() File
 "/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",
 line 526, in plot w = float(self.sampleRaster(self.InRastW.currentText(),
 self.xCoord, self.yCoord))/10 File
 "/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",
 line 300, in sampleRaster return self.sampleRaster20(layer, x, y) File
 "/home/dassau/.qgis2/python/plugins/weibullanalyse/weibullanalysedialog.py",
 line 285, in sampleRaster20 success, data =
 layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y), QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue
 ).results() ValueError: need more than 1 value to unpack

Do you have an idea for this, too?

Thanks 
Otto

from the api http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsRasterIdentifyResult.html#a8537d25fdff215e7e9650b71a0a16783

results() returns a QMap<int, QVariant> (one item for each band), it
does not return a tuple, so you should actually call

ident = layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y),QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue).results()

and then test that ident is not empty (i,e. ident is not None and
ident.iterkeys() is not None)

for each band, if the point is outside of the raster extent or is
nodata, the value will be a null QVariant (i.e. QVariant()) which in
python is None.

Hi, 
I just tried opening jpeg 2000 sample images from pleiade sat (see
http://www.astrium-geo.com/en/23-sample-imagery fro samples) and get a
crash. 
I installed ecw support following faunalia's instructions.  
Shall I file a bug or is this a known issue of the temporary patch to bring
ecw in master ? 
can I do something playing with gdal drivers? 
R?gis

It will be a QPyNullVariant so doing

value = QPyNullVariant( int )
if not value:
    print 'Is NULL'
else:
    print 'Is not NULL'

if value is None:
    print 'Is None'
else:
    print 'Is NOT None'

will print:
Is NULL
Is NOT None

Sorry for the smart-arsing ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Bug 7941 : workaround ?
Message-ID: <51FBAA58.4000901@heurisis.eu>

Hello,

I am facing bug 7941 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7941) which has not 
been corrected yet.

I have many shapefiles in Lambert 93 and a raster file (.tif) in Lambert 
I which I would fit together. Because of the bug, I can't. Is there a 
workaround ? I tried to change the coordinates in the .tfw file but I 
does not work properly.

Any help would be appreciated.

Beno?t

Hi!
Translators are aware that there will be some changes/bugfixes. So I
have no Problem to add this in the GUI as it seems to be very useful.
Actually it is the first time translators are actively reporting back
issues in original language and I very welcome that.

The only thing is that I promised to do a String update ONE WEEK before
the final release (That should give enough time to do the 25-50 changes).

So if you want .. change it right now in the GUI so that active
translators can catch up with it.

Thanks for pointing this out

kind regards
Werner

Hi,

I was not referring to the value of QPyNullVariant( int ), but the
value that results() would return in the case of nodata (which is
QVariant() in the c++ code)

unless mistaken, that would be converted to None by Sip - or am I wrong?

The SIP API v2 for QVariant defines:

An Invalid QVariant will be represented as None
A Null QVariant will be represented as QPyNullVariant [1]

Except for feature attributes (e.g. for a vectorlayer: feature['attr']) 
which is patched by QGIS to become None in case of a Null value.

Hello,

Can you check that you have a file named ntf_r93.gsb in the
OSgeo4W/share/proj folder ? That file is a datum shift grid provided by
french IGN and is called by the  "+nadgrids=ntf_r93.gsb" parameter in the
proj.4 call.


Hien.

Ooookay, I haven't realized it and thought we're completely frozen. I forget 
all the reports. Sorry for bothering :-)

thanks for the clarification

Although it seems that testing for None does the trick,,. In the case
of nodata pixels this test does seem to work:

                  bandvalue = ident[iband]
                  if bandvalue is None:
                      bandvalue = "no data"

and in c++ nodata pixels are defined as QVariant() (i.e. a null QVariant)

Ah, now I see.

QVariant() constructs an invalid QVariant and not a NULL QVariant. [1]

Glad we could sort this out :-)

Hi,

thanks for the hint. And if I need the value of the raster? If I understand
correctly, ident will always be 1, if I have a 1 band raster layer. But how
can I get the value at QgsPoint(x,y) of the raster? I don't understand that
from the value tool plugin.

In QGIS 1.8 I use :

success, data = layer.identify(QgsPoint(x,y))
   for band, value in data.items():
   return value

and in QGIS 2.0:

ident = layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y),QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue).results()
   ?

Thanks again

Otto

no,  ident will be a dict with an element of key 1

you get exactly the fist band's value at the point with ident[1] .

the key of the map is the band number, and the value is the value (or
None if nodata/out of bounds)

so without any error checking you would do

ident = layer.dataProvider().identify(QgsPoint(x,y),QgsRaster.IdentifyFormatValue).results()
return ident[1]

I'm sorry I didn't mention it earlier. Well, now I'd start from writting down 
all the needed metadata tags (for plugins they are in the file I mentioned; 
Victor, could you prepare such list for SEXTANTE?) and all needed API calls.
I believe it may lead to a decision of making qgs classes for data structures, 
like I mentioned. Those structures can be still populated with data by the 
serverside-filtering API, to not invest too much GSoC time into refactoring. A 
new API can be added in version 2 and the old one can be depreciated (or not) 
in a version 3... I must say I don't have much experience with similar 
solutions existing around, so for me your work on styles is still a kind of 
prototypying, and I expect many ideas may change.

Anyway, my next task should be a real versioning for plugins, in order to 
allow downloading (and locking) any previous version of a non working plugin.
As I'd like to avoid downloading all the thousands of plugins x versions in 
each request for local filtering, we'll probably have to add more requests to 
the API. Most likely, there will be an aditional metadata tag 
"alternate_versions" included to the main big request, and also another 
requests for details of the chosen version. I'll think about it for Brighton. 

As you see there is still a lot of details to be precised, so don't be 
disappointed if you find your present work more a prototype than the final long-
term stage :-)

Hi,

I have a question to update the code I sent in a former below to QGIS 2.0.
Again I need the mean value, currently use:

vpoly = QgsVectorLayer("Polygon", "pointbuffer", "memory")
feature = QgsFeature()
feature.setGeometry(QgsGeometry.fromPoint(QgsPoint(3517601,5406205)).buffer(10000,5))
provider = vpoly.dataProvider()
provider.addFeatures( [feature] )
vpoly.commitChanges()
stats = QgsZonalStatistics(vpoly,"/path/to/corine2006_z0_test_gk3.tif")
stats.calculateStatistics(None)
allAttrs = provider.attributeIndexes()       
for feature in vpoly.getFeatures():
   for attr in feature.attributes():
      return attr

attr in this case is probably the sum as I can see from the results, but I
need the mean again, as below. 

For QGIS 1.8 k==0 is number of pixels, k==1 is sum, k==2 is mean, see below.
But something like return attr[2] doesn't work. It says TypeError: 'float'
object has no attribute 'getitem'. Maybe someone has an idea how to solve
this?

Thanks a lot

Otto

Hi Denis,

It was great work on some of the icons you did recently(particularly the add
layer icons)..

I am on the side of replacing the topology checker icon..I did that while
playing with Inkscape :)
please consider it if you have time..

Any reason why the QGIS master ubuntu precise package still links against gdal 1.7? Would it not make sense for the master build to use 1.10 from the ubuntugis_unstable repo?

That's the way it's always been, qgis.org packages are built against
stock ubuntu. It's a less complicated/cleaner approach. If you want
newer deps you use ubuntugis. Generally mixing the 2 repos does not play
nice.

It should actually be possible to setup a launchpad recipe to rebuild
master in ubuntugis-testing or some other ppa and it is quite easy to
recompile master oneself too.

Thanks,
Alex

There are two repositories - one building againgst plain ubuntu and one
building against ubuntugis (see [1]).   Apperently you are using the former
on as the latter should carry qgis with GDAL 1.10 (see [2])

Hej,
I hope this is the right mailing list to ask about SEXTANTE specifically looking at the qgis dissolve tool. The qgis dissolve tool in sextante only appears to accept polygons but I suppose that only recently polyline support has also been supported http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5059. I was simply wondering if I wanted to change this where/how would I change this?

Hi,
When loading an Excel file in QGIS. The first line may be the name of 
the columns.
If all fields are string type, automatic recognition fails. see 
http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_xls.html.

In this case, the fields in QGIS are named field1, field2, ...
How to disable the automatic recognition (ie have the equivalent of 
OGR_XLS_HEADERS = FORCE)?

Would it be possible to add an option in the interface to specify 
whether or not the first line of field names?

Dear all,

 

As some of you may be aware, we've been trying to secure a group-discount on
accommodation for the upcoming Brighton QGIS Hackfest.  Unfortunately this
has not been possible due to the high demand for rooms at that time due to
other conferences (organisers are confident they will be fully booked).  

 

It therefore important that if you book your own accommodation.

Apologies if this has caused any inconvenience.  

 

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions at all.
Looking forward to seeing you all in September.

Dear QGIS developer,

 

I am asking is there an existing package for hydrological
modeling(especially watershed delineation tool) in QGIS plug-in category
or Is here someone plan to develop  a SWAT plug-in for QGIS? I've known
that MapWindowGIS (MWSWAT) already has this feature, however, It will be
much more interesting if there is a similar package for QGIS because
QGIS is platform free. I will be appreciated if here some experts could
let me know about it or plan for it.

 

Looking forward to hearing from you.

And there are already some tools in QGIS (like TauDEM in SEXTANTE)

Hey Willem,

I'm not aware of a feature like that.  The best place to ask this question
to see if anyone is working, or planning to work, on it is the developer
list.  I have copied it in so it show up there too.

Caching could be done by storing the returned results in a memory
spatialite database. The tricky thing is knowing when to get any new
results from the postgis database when things have changed on the database.
 How does Manifold handling viewing an area, updating something using SQL
on the database (not though Manifold) and then looking at that area again?

Hi Willem,

Why can you not save such a layer or a selection from such a layer, as a local shapefile (or other supported format). is this not effectively a "local cache"? Delete/overwrite when you desire.


Where is the performance bottleneck? Postgis, network, QGIS?? Just creating a local cache will not necessarily speed things up, if your database is on a fast server with a fast network, it may even get slower.


Sourcepole have developed (for NIWA, New Zealand) a plugin that supports local caching of WMS & WFS data sources. This could probably be adapted to support other input formats. Marco Hugentobler did the coding for this - he can perhaps comment?

As Nathan says, caching a local snapshot of a dynamic, multi-user database will result in something that gets out of sybc with the source pretty quickly. Caching a local copy of a largely static database is relatively safe.

Cheers

Brent

Hey Willem,

I'm not aware of a feature like that. ?The best place to ask this question to see if anyone is working, or planning to work, on it is the developer list. ?I have copied it in so it show up there too.

Caching could be done by storing the returned results in a memory spatialite database. The tricky thing is knowing when to get any new results from the postgis database when things have changed on the database. ?How does Manifold handling viewing an area, updating something using SQL on the database (not though Manifold) and then looking at that area again?

Hi Willem

Another thing to explore is the offline editing plugin. It caches 
postgis layers to a local spatialite database and can even be used to 
synchronise edits between local spatialite db and remote postgis db.

 >Sourcepole have developed (for NIWA, New Zealand) a plugin that 
supports local caching of WMS & WFS data sources. This could probably be 
adapted to support other input >formats. Marco Hugentobler did the 
coding for this - he can perhaps comment?

The plugin saves WMS as local rasters and WFS as local vectors. This is 
similar to save as local vector / raster file by hand. However the 
plugin is more convenient because it manages the local storage and the 
reference to the remote uri.  It has some other nice features like 
synchronizing / offlining in a graphical way. Btw., we hope to include 
this plugin (a C++ one) into the main repository after 2.0 feature 
freeze is over.

Regards,
Marco

Hello,

The 2.0 user manual already has a section about how to use The atlas in
print composer.

http://documentation.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/print_composer.html

There are some pictures still missing but I have just made a pull request
to include them.


I hope it helps.

Hi all,

I am *guessing* that Manifold is using the .NET Dataset type to cache data,
and that some kind of db manager takes care of the sync.

SQLAlchemy could be used in a python plugin for the same purpose.

Best,
Angelos

SQLAlchemy is a ORM it's not going to help with any kind of caching.

There are plans for creating a in memory feature cache of sorts so that we
don't have to fetch each feature everytime however there is a bit of
work involved in making sure we update the view when the data
source changes.

Hi Nathan,

I did not mean that SQLAlchemy can do this out of the box ;)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Force QGIS to use a different version of Python in
	Snow Leopard
Message-ID: <CAC4KD+HXenz9R3ZjpkRgViMt=yPvnzeeHq3TLE5kW7tHUFp-JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I'm using QGIS 1.8.0 for Snow Leopard, downloaded from KingChaos wiki
(http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/qgis). Once I open QGIS plugin
console, I can see QGIS is using Snow Leopard's default Python
(2.6.1).

At the same time, I've installed Python 2.7.5 and some packages I
need, like numpy or scipy. Specifically, I need scipy 0.12. If I open
python from a command line, version 2.7.5 is used.

The problem is I need that QGIS also uses Python 2.7, to detect scipy
0.12 (default system Python, 2.6.1, uses scipy 0.11.0). Default Python
is installed at /Library/Python, but my manually installed Python 2.7
is installed at /Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework. I guess QGIS
looks for default Python first.

How could I "force" QGIS to use my own Python version? Do I have to
compile it by myself, instead of using KingChaos packages? I was
thinking in something easier, like modifying Python path just for
QGIS.

Best regards,

You can't.  QGIS includes its own python interpreter and links directly to the Python framework.  This ties it to a specific version and distribution (ie system Python 2.6).  You either need to compile your own QGIS to use the other python, or install scipy for the system python.

I'm working on updating my Scipy distribution if you can wait, I just got distracted by the fortran requirement.

Many thanks for your response, William.

It's curious, because I've installed scipy 0.12 for system Python from
command line, but QGIS can't detect it. So, if I execute this from
command line:

python2.6
>>> import scipy
>>> scipy.version.version

I see 0.12 as version number. But from QGIS plugins --> Python
console, if I execute

>>> import scipy
>>> scipy.version.version

I see 0.11.0

Even when I'm using the same Python version (exactly the same), the
Python path is different in console than in QGIS. And I don't know
why.

Here, a screenshot that explains this:

Where did you get this Scipy?  If it's from Scipy, then it is NOT for the system Python, and you probably installed Python 2.6 (as well as 2.7) from Python.org.  I don't know of anyone else building a Scipy for the system python, or I wouldn't bother myself.

Same version of Python does not necessarily mean same installation of Python, on OS X.  From the Terminal you can find out what Python is found:

type python
type python2.6
type python2.7

System pythons will be in /usr/bin.  python.org python will probably be in /usr/local/bin, or /Library/Frameworks.

Scipy is from the official page, yes. I tried downloading the sources
and compiling them with system python (/usr/bin/python2.6 setup.py
build), but I got a bunch of errors. I guess that's what you're
dealing with.

I also installed Python 2,7 from Python.org, but I didn't install Python 2.6.

The difference I saw is that sys.path is not the same from command
line (Python 2.6) than from QGIS console. From QGIS console, sys.path
doesn't include the Scipy 0.12 location. From command line, does.

Yes. python and python2.7 are the same:
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/python2.7, and
/usr/local/bin/python is also a symlink to the previous one. But
python2.6 is /usr/bin/python2.6 (system Python).

I feel confused for this reason:

- Executing python2.6 from command line (system Python, not installed
by me): scipy 0.12 is detected
- Executing python from QGIS console (I assume is also system Python,
as you said): scipy 0.11 is detected

Difference is in sys.path. From QGIS console doesn't include the
location of Scipy 0.12. From command line does.

But I don't want to mess things up and wasting your time. I'll wait.

Hi J?rgen,

> Right.  Is there anything wrong with our ubuntugis nightly builds?

The only problem is the nightly build links to the gdal 1.7 lib which is very old now. When I test the latest QGIS master build I also want to see it in the context of a much newer gdal.

A newer gdal such as 1.9 or 1.10 provides FileGDB support, much better UTF-8 fixes and a large number bug fixes.

Cheers,
Jeremy

One possibility then is that your ~/.bash_profile has a PYTHONPATH setting, maybe from installing Python 2.7, to add the Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/... site-packages to your sys.path.  This would let the system python see modules installed in the python.org python folder, but QGIS won't see these because OS X applications don't get the shell environment.

Using PYTHONPATH to add python.org stuff to the system python is a bit dangersous because binary components of modules (ie scipy has binary code) are built for a specific version of Python (but not necessarily same installation in this case).  Loading scipy for python.org 2.7, in system python 2.6 may seem to load fine but have problems when you try to use scipy functionality, but a scipy for python.org 2.6 should work in the system python 2.6.

Hi Minoru

Thanks for fixing the encoding issues.

Btw., I noticed that creating new attributes with non-latin characters 
does not work. It however seems to work with utf-8 encoded shapes. Is it 
a dbf limitation or a QGIS bug?

Regards,
Marco

Ok, it was that. So silly. You're right. I'll delete the PYTHONPATH
setting from the profile file.

So, I guess the only way is to recompile QGIS to use the newer version
of Python (with Scipy 0.12) or compile Scipy 0.12 to be used with
system Python. If you're working on it, that will be great (it's
necessary for QGIS Animove plugin support on Mac, one project I've
been working on)

I guess it's a GDAL issue but, fortunately, it has been already fixed.
With GDAL 1.10, creating attributes with non-ascii characters works
fine even if the "Ignore shapefile encoding declaration" option is not
checked.

That's the vanilla ubuntu build - as said there is a separate nightly build in
a separate repository for ubuntugis[1].

Hi Pete,
the situation is quite confusing, I'm getting several emails by people
not knowing what to do. Could you please clarify on the mailing list,
with clear indications on what to do? Especially important is to give
the first choice of the hotel, so we'll stay all at the same place.
BTW, how far are the hotels from the HF room?
Horst, could you please proceed with a group reservation for all core
devs who requested support? As for now, I have:

Macho
Pasotti
Ghetta
Dassau
Junek
Bernasocchi
Jurgiel
Cavallini

Please note that not everybody will stay for the whole period.
If this is to complicated, we can ask everybody to book and pay
individually, and we'll send the refund afterwards.
All the best.

Just in case it helps, I have booked at the Ibis already. Tried to
book a double to share with Matthias Kuhn, but only rooms with a
single bed were available. I left a note saying that, if possible, I
would like a room with two beds, but got no reply, so for now, you
should consider Matthias as well in the group of people without
room...

Cheers

Hi,

I've also individually booked at IBIS since I've understood that group
reservation was not going to be made.

Hi all.
Sorry to insist, but I still have only a few confirmations: could
please anyone who needs hotel and/or flight reimbursement let me know,
if they have not done it already?
All the best.

Dear all,

I usually compile QGIS from source using git. I use Ubuntu 13.04 and had 
compiled QGIS on that OS many times.
This morning, I made a "git fetch" to update the current source, and 
launch the compilation ("make") after a "ccmake .." + "c" + "g", and it 
stopped with the last following lines:

Hi Paolo,

Thanks for your email.  Just to re-iterate a point I made in my last email:


" As some of you may be aware, we've been trying to secure a group-discount
on accommodation for the upcoming Brighton QGIS Hackfest.  Unfortunately
this has not been possible due to the high demand for rooms at that time due
to other conferences (organisers are confident they will be fully booked). 

It therefore important that if you book your own accommodation..."


I've just made an update to the wiki page (accommodation section) with
distances of the hotels from Brighton rail station.  They range between 0.1
and 1.0 miles (0.2 to 1.6km) from Brighton rail station.  As the venue is on
the edge of the town (in the university campus), we will either need to take
a bus or a train there each morning, hence why I've listed the distances
from the rail station rather than the venue.  From the rail station to the
venue:

- By bus, 25mins
- By train, 15mins

I have also included a link to a google-map featuring the venues and all the
hotels (I thought I had added this previously, apologies for that).  

I'd recommend people stay at the closest hotels to the station so the order
of the list on the wiki now reflects my recommendation (highest priority at
the top).  

I recommend the following course of action:

1. Individuals book their own accommodation
2. If a group-booking is to be made for core-devs, then contact those devs
to ensure they have not already made accommodation plans (e.g. I know Werner
was planning to stay with Saber so it's worth asking him).  

As far as I am aware, the following people are staying with Saber:

Nathan Woodrow
Tim Sutton
Werner Macho

And the following with my colleague Hugo Martins:

Giovanni Manghi

I hope that makes everything clear and once again, apologies for any
confusion caused.  


Kind regards,

Pete

Hi Pete,
the situation is quite confusing, I'm getting several emails by people not
knowing what to do. Could you please clarify on the mailing list, with clear
indications on what to do? Especially important is to give the first choice
of the hotel, so we'll stay all at the same place.
BTW, how far are the hotels from the HF room?
Horst, could you please proceed with a group reservation for all core devs
who requested support? As for now, I have:

Macho
Pasotti
Ghetta
Dassau
Junek
Bernasocchi
Jurgiel
Cavallini

Please note that not everybody will stay for the whole period.
If this is to complicated, we can ask everybody to book and pay
individually, and we'll send the refund afterwards.
All the best.

Hi Pete,
thanks for the clarification; having an hotel far from the HF venue
proved a major hassle, and caused loss of productivity and fun: isn't
it possible to find something closer to the University?
Possibly something simpler and cheaper?
All the best.

Considering that quite a few of us have already booked at Ibis...I
guess we should stay there even if it's not close. Being far from the
venue might mean losing productivity and fun, but being in different
hotels, far from the others is not good for productivity
neither...(and it completely spoils all the fun).

my 2 cents

Hi Paolo,

We've already taken some time to consider the locations carefully.  

-  Finding a venue to give up an appropriate room and for a reasonable price
limited us to the University of Sussex's campus
-  Google shows only a single hotel nearby
-  The campus is on the outskirts of the town, far from restaurants, bars
and other fun stuff

We have also tried to keep costs as low as possible.  As people have already
started making their accommodation arrangements and we have booked a number
of venues for dinners throughout the long weekend in Brighton, it makes
sense to stick to the current proposals.  If you manage to find better
options, please let me know.  


Kind regards,

Pete

Hi Peter,
  Just a thought, but what about the university's halls of residence?
That's what they're using for FOSS4G.

Hi Jonathan,

We had already considered that. But the timing of the HF is conflicting 
with the same weekend when the university is opening for the new 
semester. Everything is fully booked.

In terms of other accomedation, there are some events happening in 
Brighton which has made group booking not possible.

Thanks
Saber

I think it depends on how it is in metadata and I am not sure if changing
to defaulting everything to PNG is good.
you could bring this question to qgis developer mailing list [0] in order
to get a more specific answer !

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Labeling issues
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8-SVWSpW=zuU5DDWFAQS6AssyUGO6MUKcRwEJRSdOemw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Due to family and work commitments I have not been able to focus on fixing
outstanding labeling issues much in the past month. However, I have finally
been able to clear the next 5 days to work solely on these issues.

Here is what I will be initially working on (in order):

* Creating a Python unit test suite for labeling, at first specifically to
address current major issues

* Issue #8068 (and 8413), wrong font display in qgis server [0]

* Issue #3975, new label engine vectorizing texts in (printed) output [1]

* Pull request #640, labeling performance [2]

After addressing those, I will work on how to remove old labeling and any
other labeling- / Mac-specific issues, in preparation for 2.0 release.

If anyone is currently working on any of these issues, please let me know
(so we don't double-up work).

Subject: [Qgis-developer] plugin  localizations stopped working?
Message-ID: <1569517251.20130808092403@gis-lab.info>

Hi,

is  it  me  or  plugin  localizations stopped working in master? I have tried on several
plugins and came to a conclusion that i18n support in plugins is broken.

It  seems  that you can use other languages of the plugin i18n only if
chosen    language    matches   your   system  locale. And even worse,
if switch to EN from you locale once you cannot switch back.

Switching to any other language of core QGIS works without problem.

Can someone confirm? I'll be happy to fill a bug.

Hi, 
on OSGEO4W latest master, "Close" and "Help" buttons in many dialogs are not
translated (fr and de tested). 
See for example "Add postgis dialog". 
Any Idea? Is this related to osgeo build and QT versions?

Hi,

Are you sure it is new ? Untranslated Qt's buttons have been here for 
years (since the removal of qt_*.ts).

Message-ID: <CA+H0G_G5a=EKO82S41WQgbOMpL7EcXKBSD+Wti-d-VeB-nbgHQ@mail.gmail.com>

Using QGIS 1.9 d821bcc, in windows 7 64bits, I'm not able to change the
title of raster layers in the legend using legend item properties tab.

I have no problems changing the title when working with vector layers.

Can anyone confirm this? I'm pretty sure I have done this before.

Is there a ticket for it?

Hmm. Had a sporadic the other day with a vector rather than a raster. I'd change the title and the print composer repeatedly ignored the change. 

I dumped the layer from the legend then added it back in and everything worked as expected. 

That might at least help as a work around. 

-ramon.

You are right, it's an old issue. 
Any idea why ts files have been removed ?

I have now booked my flight and room. I have a problem: both Ibis and
Jurys are now full on the 14th: is there anybody willing to share a
room for that night? Or (Pete, Saber) is there another reasonable

Hi Paolo,

Sorry to hear that.
Have you tried other options we have in the wiki?

http://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/10_QGIS_Developer_Meeting_in_Brighton_2013#Accommodation

Let me know if you still can't find any room and we can think of of 
other alternatives.

Victor and I are still waiting for a response from the Hotel if they're 
able to put another bed into the room, so we can share it. We didn't 
get any response, and if they say it's not possible and it's already 
fully booked, as you point out, I'm afraid I'll have to spend the 
nights in some lonely park in a tent with Paolo...

But others will be welcome to have a tea with us there in the evening 
before returning to their comfy hotel beds of course.

Hi guys,
I don't have already book neither the flight nor the Hotel. Flight will 
be not a problem (I'll do it soon) and for the hotel I don't have any 
problem to share a room with somebody.
What am I suppose to do? Should I book the hotel by myself or, if 
sharing a room, someone that has already booked for himself the room can 
take care of it?

No problem for me to share the room in those nights. But I'll stay a day 
longer (till Sunday) and it would be great if anybody else shares the 
room Saturday night.
How should we proceed for the booking?

Hello all,

I look for somebody who was involved into the creation of then new
metadata menu in the layer properties.
What's the usage of the several url-fields? Can I use these for
metadata catalogues, like the INSPIRE catalogue?
We need these descriptions for the user manual 2.0 .

Any hints welcome.
Thanks.

Kind regards,
Larissa

I suggest to contact the hotel on:
+441273 201 000

They are very slow in responding emails. Better to call and talk to 
someone for room sharing.

Thanks

I didn't book the room either. Is there anybody still wanting to share?
I updated the wiki regarding the recent feedback on the ML and there are still 
ten of us labelled "yot yet booked".

Otherwise I can just book a twin room.  According to the online reservation 
systems, Travelodge Seafront and Premier Inn look to me optimal. So let me 
share the same question: How should we proceed for the booking?

I asked for support. But I'll stay a night longer (I'll leave on Sunday) 
and so someone else can share  the same room with me just for Saturday. 
Or maybe, for the last day, should I move to another room?

Cheers,

Matteo

Message-ID: <1376061356682-5071749.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all, 
Xavier Culos here coded a public plugin published today :

http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/nominatim/

It makes a dockable panel to help find osm places, zoom on it, quickly fly
over results to have them confirmed by a rubberband on canvas, and generate
memory layers of objets, or a mask from that object.

We have the same tools linked on a postgis database (or any spatial db in
fact)  in our intranet, linked on our specific datasets.. So if this gives
you ideas, please spread the word and give us some feedback on it! 

R?gis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Renaming SEXTANTE
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yFfnjXwgu10ovuPkgcw+Y77F7=_qYtPdCGgzdruqk=zA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

After much thinking and considering some suggestions, I think it would
be a good idea to remove the SEXTANTE branding, and just have
everything with a more descriptive name, such as "geoanalysis",
"processing", or something like that. In the long-term, that will help
to integrate the analysis framework into QGIS,and help users locate
it.

It shouldn't be more difficult than just replacing string ocurrences,
but before doing such a big (and potentially troublesome) change, I
would like to hear the opinion you guys have about this (is it a good
idea? what name should we use instead of "sextante" for packages and
modules? any good refactoring tool that you recommend?,etc)

I am going to be out of office next week, so I might not read my email
everyday, but it would be great to hear what you think about it. Once
I am back, I will proceed to change it,

I discussed it briefly with Tim and Paolo, who agreed on this, so I
assumme this is not incompatible with the API freeze and the release
plan that we have, but if anyone thinks this shouldn't be done now,
please say it. I personally think that it would be good to have it in
2.0, so all analysis stuff is called "analysis" (or whatever) and not
with a name that (although I like and feel very identified with it)
for most people doesn't make much sense...

Thanks in advance.

Victor

Hi,
Many people refer to "Vector" and "Raster" tools as Ftools and GDAL.
Sextante, in my opinion, is not different, so I dont see why we should
change anything. The Sextante menu is called "Analysis" which makes sense.
And Sextante toolbox seems to be a good name, as well as Sextante Modeler.

Additionally, Sextante is a recognizable name for gvsig and Arcgis users.
Considering that we can expect that a lot more users are going to start
using QGIS after 2.0 is released, it would make sense the keep the Sextante
naming

Best regards
F.

I have to agree with this, Sextante has become a very recognizable "brand" I feel renaming it doesn't really bring any real benefit and users already know Sextante will be doing Analysis, my two cents with this

Subject: Re: [Qgis-developer] Renaming SEXTANTE

Hi,Many people refer to "Vector" and "Raster" tools as Ftools and GDAL. Sextante, in my opinion, is not different, so I dont see why we should change anything. The Sextante menu is called "Analysis" which makes sense. And Sextante toolbox seems to be a good name, as well as Sextante Modeler.

Additionally, Sextante is a recognizable name for gvsig and Arcgis users. Considering that we can expect that a lot more users are going to start using QGIS after 2.0 is released, it would make sense the keep the Sextante naming

Best regardsF.

Agreed (to the doesn't make much sense to users). +1 from me for this much
needed approach to the naming of core plugins.

Concerning branding (and with no disrespect to any third-party projects
brought into core), the brand is not SEXTANTE, not fTools, not GDALTools...
the brand is QGIS.

Here are some examples of current branding confusion for a user:

* GDALTools, fTools, and SEXTANTE are listed in the Plugin Manager. These
names are indecipherable to a new user, especially one new to GIS or FOSS4G.

* Once activated, there is no indication that any particular part or action
of the Vector menu is related to fTools, so it's hard for a user to discern
core functionality from a plugin's. This is the way core plugins should be
shown, as part of the app. In this case, however, there is a disconnect due
to branding.

* The Raster menu has GDALTools settings at the bottom of it. Again, it is
unclear to which tools these settings apply.

* In the SEXTANTE Toolbox there is a big button at the top, which links to
a third-party site. While this makes sense for a third-party plugin, it is
inconsistent with other core tools, and makes it appear the tool is not
actually a core functionality. A discrete Help button at the bottom of the
toolbox, that goes to QGIS-related help for the tool makes more sense.

In my opinion, the following core plugins should be renamed to similar
names as such:

SEXTANTE -> Geoanalysis Tools
GDALTools -> Raster Tools
fTools -> Vector Tools

Their icons should be updated to reflect their place and purpose within
QGIS.

An example of a core plugin that looks and acts like a core plugin to QGIS
is DB Manager. There is absolutely no disconnect between name, due to
unnecessary branding, or purpose in the app, to the user. The user clearly
understands what it is in Plugin Manager and, once activated, the plugin
blends in nicely as part of the app (though maybe the icon needs updated to
match newer ones).

This is not to say credit should be ignored. These are considerable
contributions to the project. The underlying external projects ported to
core should reasonably be accessible to the user, possibly in the About
dialog, and possibly with links directly to an external resource for each
(where appropriate). This should probably be done for providers as well.

Side note: there should probably also be some indication within Plugin
Manager that a plugin is 'core,' hopefully prompting a user that it is
something they should not generally consider disabling.

Regards,

Larry

+1 here for dropping the SEXTANTE name for the same reason we now have a 
Vector menu instead of fTools.

I would vote for a "processing" menu as sextante goes beyond analysis

+1 from me too.

Personally I find the core plugin concept unnecessary. If it's core it
shouldn't be a plugin and should just be part of the main program.  It can
still be Python that is fine however users shouldn't have to turn them on
and off they should just be there and be transparent.

IMO we should aim to kill of all C++ core plugins in 2.1 and make them core
features.Things like the geometry checking, spatial join, georeferencer
should all be core features and have C++ and Python APIs that the user can
use.

Message-ID: <C6B695652D5E6B4597E90C5734C02426169D3D6DC0@prdlsmmsg01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi QGIS devs!

Since the latest round of code changes (maybe over the last 2 months) I can no longer open Esri FileGDB in QGIS. I can read the database and QGIS prompts me from the FileGDB layers to add to the map, but when I select the layer from this dialog QGIS just hangs. I did some debugging and it seems to hang on the OGR_DS_Destroy call within QgsOgrFeatureIterator::close(). Does anyone else have this problem?

I'm running FileGDB SDK 1.3 and Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with QGIS master. I've tested this with the OSGeo4W win32 qgis-dev package and I don't get the problem.

Could this be related to this issue: http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/76527-CloseDatabase-hanging-on-64-bit-Linux-when-same-File-Geodatabase-opened-twice

??

Cheers,
Jeremy

Hi Gino,

If you know who you are sharing room with, one of you can contact the 
hotel directly and arrange for a shared room.

	customization
Message-ID: <1376200103997-5071869.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hey everyone, 

I'm building a custom QGIS Installer for Windows with a stripped down QGIS
GUI. 

In the comments of these instructions it says that this is possible by using
the customization function of QGIS. 

http://linfiniti.com/2011/05/building-custom-qgis-installers-for-windows/

But how does it work exactly? How do I save the custom GUI? Export the
Windows registry key "QGISCUSTOMIZATION" or save it as a .ini file? And
where in the installer package do I place it? 

Thank you! :)

I like GRASS menus, it has all the analytical modules under vector and 
raster menu. Can similar thing be done with SEXTANTE?

Hey Alex,

We are going with the svg that is assigned to that ticket for this release.

So is the proposal to change Analysis to Processing?
I don't think there's a reason to remove the SEXTANTE branding as
SEXTANTE does exist outside a QGIS context, ftools is another story
since that only exists in QGIS. I'm split on GDAL Tools, since it is
good to make sure users know what underlying tool is being used (ie in
the event they want to use the command line).

As for the Vector, Raster, etc menus... it's expected that over time
plugins will sort themselves into those menus in order to add
organization and make it more obvious what a tool does. It also makes
the generic plugins section smaller so that you don't have to wade
through 100 plugins to find the one you want.

The same applies for Analysis or Processing, I expect other analysis and
processing tools to exist that are not SEXTANTE but end up on the list,
in which case being able to tell it apart from what's there remains
important.

To me this is a UI question, not a core vs. non-core/c++ vs. python
question. ie: How do we organize and arrange menus to maximize discovery
of tools and ease workflow (fewer clicks or faster nav to the correct tool).

Analysis or Processing are both fine to me so +0 or maybe Advanced ....?

Thanks,
Alex

I wasn't very fond of this idea because or course I like the SEXTANTE
branding itself, but in terms of integration I now think it is better.
For a user that wants to do some analysis, keeping the SEXTANTE name
means that the user has to know that SEXTANTE is an analysis platform,
instead of just being able to look for analysis tools. The menu is
already called "analysis", so actually that's not going to be a big
problem, but then it doesn't make much sense to have named plugins,
specially if it's a core plugin.

I disagree in that it's a good thing to keep names in other plugins or
tools, such as GDAL tools. It looks like a good idea to most of us,
because we *know* what GDAL is. For those that don't (and could find
those tools very useful), "GDAL tools" means nothing. One of the main
goals of the SEXTANTE toolbox is to hide the origin of the algorithms
that are run. The user doesn't need to know if it's GRASS, or SAGA, or
OTB, or it is a native python algorihtm. Advanced users can use the
advanced mode, which shows that, but non-advanced ones (the vast
majority,,,) will find if much easier to just look for the algorithm
that they need.

Thanks a lot for your suggestions!

Cheers
VIctor

The issue is more that in plugin manager you see all these strangely named
things which don't match their corresponding user interface components...

Also users of the API have to deal with these naming ideosychrasies - it
would be much nicer to do geoprocessing.* than sextante.*

Showing SEXTANTE, GDAL Tools, fTools in the menu is the implementation
model leaking into the UI.  The users don't care how it's implemented as
long as it works.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] September 1 branch for release
Message-ID: <CALCNqkY7U+W1y_4MxKsQnUHU5SjBV5n8HRm=+1dH_FPrepraFQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All

If we want to be ready with QGIS 2.0 for FOSS4G2013 we should ideally be
ready to branch for release at the beginning of September (since most of us
will be migrating to the land of deep fried mars bars for September).

Here is my proposal to achieve that:

* 12 Aug GUI Freeze, String Freeze, call for final translations
* 25 Aug - Point of no return - final decision on whether to release with
blockers
* 1 Sept - Tag QGIS 2.0, call for packaging
* 7 Sept - Public announcement of QGIS 2.0

Please consider the first item in the list in effect now, so the GUI and
strings should not change except for critical bug fixes (icon tweaks and
'poodle fluffing the GUI' are no longer allowed).

Any remaining Blockers at point of release will be clearly identified as
'known issues'. On 25 August we (PSC) vote agreement on whether to go ahead
with release or to postpone it. There would be an automatic revote each
week until quorum is reached (basically giving us 2 postponement dates
before FOSS4G). I really really really want QGIS 2.0 to be ready for FOSS4G
and it would be nice to not be working on it at the QGIS HF in Brighton.

The proposal on the table is that any remaining blockers be clearly listed
as known issues in the release announcements.

Speaking of release announcements, I have set up a very alpha-y web site
for creating a visual changelog and I am looking for volunteers to add
entries to this. If you have some time to write about the new features
coming in QGIS 2.0 please contact me.

If those 'out there' in the community have the ability to fund the closing
of the remaining blocker issues [1] either by donating money to QGIS or by
sponsoring developer time independently of the QGIS project your
contributions will be so gratefully received.

Finally a reminder that there is still a call out for nominations for new
PSC members [2] so if you know someone suitable for the post, please go
ahead and nominate them!

Well there's an interesting dilemma, I mostly agree that core plugins
don't need to be listed in the plugin manager.. except when one wants to
disable them to get faster load times of QGIS, or to hide those features.

Maybe they should be renamed to Core Vector Tools, Core Raster Tools,
Core Geoprocessing Tools (looks like Larry suggested similar) to
highlight that they ship by default with QGIS. I was also thinking about
when plugins add items to Vector/Raster/Analysis menu, how does one
differentiate which plugin a particular tool comes from, so that bug
reports go to the right place?

As for when you're in SEXTANTE, I don't think hiding where the tool
comes from is a good idea. What happens when there are 2 IDW algorithms
and one works and the other doesn't or their methods are different.
There needs to be enough information for an informed decision. It's also
a means of attribution to the original toolbox that's being wrapped.
Which in my case has led to me using some tools directly when they don't
work right or are missing options in the SEXTANTE wrapper (same goes for
the GRASS plugin).

The "as long as it works" is the catch, I often find myself moving
between the tools that do similar things because one does what I want
and the other does not, or one doesn't work the same way, or one if
faster than the other. So being able to distinguish between very similar
tools is important.

Basically I'm in agreement, but trying to leave room for understanding
how some of the current information will remain accessible.

Tim - good points about the api naming, which should indeed match the
core plugins/tools names.

Thanks,
Alex

Hi Nathan

I think the plugin concept is highly usefull for both core/noncore, C++ 
and Python plugins. It helps to keep code well separated and avoids 
bloating the size of the main executable for things which are rarely 
used ( read for e.g. here why size _does_ matter: 
https://www.webkit.org/blog/2826/unusual-speed-boost-size-matters/ ). 
Many people never use e.g. grass plugin, evis, georeferencer, globe. 
Plugins are a sophisticated way of keeping things lean and separated.

 >however users shouldn't have to turn them on

That's the same thing for toolbars which are hidden by default or the 
browser. Many people don't notice those features. However, Iwe cannot 
clutter the interface with everything by default just to save the user 
from doing a click or looking up things in the documentation or with google.

Regards,
Marco

Hi all.
I agree the plugin architecture is useful. IMHO the issue is mainly a
matter of hiding too much detail for the average user.
Of course having functions available to Py plugins is an important
feature.
All the best.

I have no issue with none core plugins, in fact that is something I always
promote as a powerful feature. Core however plugins are a different story.
While it makes sense to you and I it doesn't make sense to a normal user.
Core plugins, while a feature, in fact make the program look incomplete or
patchy.  Some of the main problems with core plugins are: they don't have a
Python C++ API, functions in them are separated by wall, users have to
enable them in order to use them.

Lets take a few examples:  A question the other day on IRC was "can I
create a heatmap with pyqgis" No is the answer which is confusing because
the heatmap plugin is a core feature so why not have it as part of the API?
 The topology checker is another example of the features it has should be
part of the core package and just baked in. This would allow tighter
integration into the drawing tools and other core features. Can you imagine
if snapping was a core plugin? or the composer?

I do see the core plugin idea useful as a staging area for things we are
not sure fully about just yet or still have issues.

Hi all.
This point should be stressed, and the word spread through social
networks: with only 14 blockers, if a bunch of power users take care
of one each, with a reasonable effort we can have a blockers-free
release, a major target IMHO.
All the best.

Hi Victor,

Considering Tim's latest mail about string and GUI freeze, are you still
planning to change the naming for 2.0?

Best wishes,
Anita

I think this should be simple to address - maintain them as plugins but
load them automatically and transparently to the user. We could even have a
new class oc core plugins that do this and explcitly bypass the plugin
manager ui because they are always 'just on'.

Yes I should have asked this too - personally I prefer we do it in a future
version. Maybe its something we should keep for V3?

If you are loading them by default it doesn't make sense to keep them as a
plugins better to just make them core. It doesn't really matter at the
moment for 2.0 anyway but I'll chat about it more at the HF

I have two options:

1) provide an in-app translating system (first prize but I dont know if I
will get time to do it)
2) generate the changelog as rst and put it in transifex for translation

I was going to go with the second option which I will have time to
implement.

IMHO renaming sextante after people got used to it will introduce more
and more confusion. Better remove it now; deeper chamges in the UI can
wait.
All the best.

I guess we need some feedback on how much work is involved and how much
chance there is of breaking stuff so close to the release.

Hi Tim

The proposed schedule sounds good to me.

 >The proposal on the table is that any remaining blockers be clearly 
listed as known issues in the release announcements.

Hm, don't you think this is bad publicity for the project? After all, we 
don't list the other bugs as 'known issues', even though they are known 
as well.



Regards,
Marco

I do not think there is too much risk of breaking things, it shouldn't
be that complex.

Also, it's a plugin (core or not), so we can later publish a newer
version if something is broken, and let people update it. It's not
going to break any other code, since nothing (except plugins based on
SEXTANTE), uses the SEXTANTE code.

Hi all,

is someone having a look to the (many) pull requests? I see that there
are patched potentially fixing important/annoying bugs.

cheers!

I guess technically it isn't really needed as we have a public bug tracker
unlike most closed software which have to release a known issue list if
there are any.

Agreed: in addition to missing potentially good code, we discourage
approaching developers, which is even worse in the long term.
All the best.

+1; And I think this philosophy should be carried over to the other plugins
mentioned in this discussion - that they should be renamed sooner rather
than later.
Everyone in this thread knows what all of these things do, but a regular
user isn't going to know what "GDAL" is, or "fTools" or "SEXTANTE". As an
example - just last week I was wondering where my spatial analysis
functions were that were in a tutorial I was following - turns out I'd
disabled the pointless-sounding-to-me "fTools" plugin and they were in
there.
(I'm still quite new to QGIS, but have a technical GIS background - a
non-technical user would have struggled to resolve that).

blockers are already dropped to 12, then one has a patch awaiting
(7441), two are being worked on (8068 and 8356), another one or two
are likely a local issues, so right now we probably stand at just 8/9
issues..

Just to clarify Marco, are you saying that advertising the known issues is
bad publicity or that releasing with open blockers is bad publicity? I
think it is enough to point to the bug tracker and say that there are still
open issues for 2.0.

I wanted to say that advertising the known issues is bad publicity. 
Pointing to the bug tracker however is fine for me (it sounded to me as 
if the blockers would be listed next to the new features in the 
announcement).

Marco

Further to this I see that when you open a FIleGDB in QGIS 3 OGROpen calls made to the same database before any OGR_DS_Destroy calls are made. These open calls occur during the layer selection dialog, the OGR provider construction, and the initialisation of the QgsOgrFeatureIterator.

I'm guessing the fix for this should really be done at the Esri library level, but because we have no control over this maybe something can be done in the OGR library to reuse FileGDBAPI Geodatabase handles?

Cheers,
Jeremy

Hi QGIS devs!

Since the latest round of code changes (maybe over the last 2 months) I can no longer open Esri FileGDB in QGIS. I can read the database and QGIS prompts me from the FileGDB layers to add to the map, but when I select the layer from this dialog QGIS just hangs. I did some debugging and it seems to hang on the OGR_DS_Destroy call within QgsOgrFeatureIterator::close(). Does anyone else have this problem?

I'm running FileGDB SDK 1.3 and Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with QGIS master. I've tested this with the OSGeo4W win32 qgis-dev package and I don't get the problem.

Could this be related to this issue: http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/76527-CloseDatabase-hanging-on-64-bit-Linux-when-same-File-Geodatabase-opened-twice

??

Cheers,

Jeremy,

I do think this is exactly the issue of 
http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/76527-CloseDatabase-hanging-on-64-bit-Lin ux-

At least I reproduced it on my own PC. I've implemented a workaround in GDAL 
trunk for that issue that implements ref-counting of the FileGDBAPI Geodabase 
handle at OGR side : http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/26307.

Wow Even - just amazing as always.

Have you confirmed that you can no open a FileGDB in QGIS? I still get the freeze when using GDAL trunk, but maybe that now a QGIS problem.

No, I didn't. I've tested with the OGR API that it solved the issue with the
following access pattern :

ds1 = ogr.Open(datasetname)
ds2 = ogr.Open(datasetname)
ds2 = None
ds1 = None

Just to be sure that you are using the version with the fix, if you break with
gdb when it hangs, does it display FGdbDriver::Release() in the stack trace ?

Message-ID: <CALuHMPCPpkWa7NpJw-PH7fqC8Gpn5k8TbNQ-HRO7pNCWCPtgAA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

we decide to drop "old symbology" from QGIS 2. There is a core plugin
MapServer Export that purely based on this "old symbology". It seems
that update it to new symbology will require a lot of work.

There was a discussion about this issue some time ago [0], and if I'm not
wrong the decision is to remove plugin. Richard created pull-request [1]
but it a bit outdated.

If there are no objections and we still want to remove plugin, I'll do this.

Hi Alexander

Please go ahead and remove the plugin. Afaik there is already a newer 
one in the repository.

Nope I get a crash when opening now via OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open.

back trace is here: https://gist.github.com/palmerj/6219582

called from here in QGIS: https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L305

Message-ID: <CALuHMPB-qa==eAJhm72yPdKmXyRgetZ6GpT4tE6TNk=v_jUC7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I can't get grid displayed on composer map item. Grid is enabled,
grid interval, its color and width also set. But there is no grid on
output image, only grid annotations.

Here is script for Python console I used http://pastebin.com/TETxGYiN

Any ideas what's wrong?

Thanks

Dear Community,

we have a new QGIS case study written by Anders Skoglund and Kenichi
Matsuok. Anders is GIS specialist and Kenichi glaciologist at the Norwegian
Polar Institute.

The case study is about Quantarctica, a collection of Antarctic geographical
datasets, developed as a tool for the research community, for classrooms and
for operational use in Antarctica.

You find the whole story here:

Hi Even.

I found the problem. I needed to do a make clean before rebuilding gdal. Now everything is working and QGIS can load FIleGDBs!

Any chance to get this change back-ported to 1.10 so QGIS 2.0 will work with FIleGDBs?

Thanks again for your help.

Cheers
Jeremy

Nope I get a crash when opening now via OGRSFDriverRegistrar::Open.

back trace is here: https://gist.github.com/palmerj/6219582

called from here in QGIS: https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/blob/master/src/providers/ogr/qgsogrprovider.cpp#L305

No, I didn't. I've tested with the OGR API that it solved the issue with the
following access pattern :

ds1 = ogr.Open(datasetname)
ds2 = ogr.Open(datasetname)
ds2 = None
ds1 = None

Just to be sure that you are using the version with the fix, if you break with
gdb when it hangs, does it display FGdbDriver::Release() in the stack trace ?

I've just done that (although the changeset is a bit more substantial/risky 
than the usual fixes done in stable branch).

Thanks!

I see the QGIS dev team is looking to release 2.0 about the 7th of Sept. Is there a chance to release a GDAL/OGR 1.10 point release to coincide with this? I'm particularly interested in the OSGeo4W QGIS 2.0 package then being linked against the newer 1.10.X binary release.

I believe that the gdal dll name does not change in point releases, so I don't 
think there's a strong technical reason to sync' the releases for the QGIS 2.0 
binary to benefit from a GDAL 1.10.1 binary when if it is available, if QGIS is 
built against GDAL 1.10.0. That said, we could/should do a GDAL 1.10.X point 
release at some time, so that could be a teaser. Personnaly, I'm off the first 
week of september, so the release process should start soon...

~~~~~~~~~~~~

GDAL devs,

We have already 45 tickets fixed in 1.10 branch : 
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/query?status=closed&group=resolution&milestone=1.10.1
Do you have some other things you'd like to push in the 1.10 branch for 1.10.1 
? Perhaps we could cut a 1.10.1beta1 next week ? 

GDAL users,

if you have fixes they'd like to see in 1.10.1, then it would be time to speak 
up, but preferably with a ticket with an attached patch ;-)

Hi guys,
it seems that many people (me included) has not yet a definitive 
accommodation for all the days in Brighton. The problem seems to be the 
14th (Saturday-Sunday night): many people that has already an 
accommodation for the other days are "homeless" for that night.
Any update?

Maybe people that already have a room for Saturday want to share it with 
someone else? Otherwise, how should we proceed?

Cheers

Matteo

Hi Saber,
thanks for the answer.
Before looking for other accommodations I just wanted to know if anybody 
has the opportunity to share a room already booked.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] qgsrubberBOX or special annotationitem
Message-ID: <520B5588.70304@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

for a plugin there is the need to draw a rectangle on the MapCanvas. We 
should be able to resize the rectangle with some handles or so.

First we thought to use an annotationitem for that, but looking more 
into that the functionality could be used for all kind of actions, much 
more like the qgsrubberband.

Anybody an opinion about this:
- would it be a feature devs/users willing to have?
- what would be the preferred way to implement? like a special 
rubberband, or should we stick a class 'BoxItem' between 
QgsMapCanvasItem and QgsAnnotationItem? Or should it just be new 
mapcanvasitem (just sharing a lot of things with annotationitem)? Or 
should it work like the graphic-items from composer?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

ps some uses which come to mind for me:
- draw a box and download or save the data from that box
- draw a box and only save that part as an image
- draw a box and get the extent of that box (that's the plugin :-) )

AFAIK the problem with Saturday night is quite widespread: rooms are
few and very expensive. Some assistance would be appreciated.
Scattering around in many places would not be very good.
Thanks.

Unfortunately, it is beyond what we can do.
If it is only one night, there are other places to stay. I understand 
it is not convenient.

Hi Matteo,

If you find someone who is willing to share a room, you can contact the 
hotel directly to arrange the room sharing.

 Hi,

 I?would like to see removal of old labeling and old line decoration 
 (http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8379) before the release of 2.0. I keep 
 telling people at courses/workshops that the depecrecated stuff will go 
 away with QGIS?2.0 - I?hope that this will happen.

 Who has the knowledge and time to remove the old functionality?

 Thanks,

Hi Saber,
maybe I was unclear: what we need is another place, just for Saturday
night, where several people have difficulties finding a room (at
least, one below 150 ?). One option could be to find a B&B at some
distance, picking a taxi and sharing it; I think the cheaper room
rates would make the cost of the taxi affordable.
Selecting a suitable place is obviously far more difficult from here,
without proper research on distances, taxi rates etc.
Letting everybody choose one solution on his own will be a waste of
time, and would make very difficult to share the costs of the taxi.
Thanks for understanding what is becoming a difficult situation.
All the best.

Hi All,

Although the central IBIS say that no rooms are available on the 12th to the 16th, hotels.com seem to show availability there.  I called a guy on the number below and he confirmed that they have quite a few rooms left (on the number below).  

IBIS
88 92 Queens Road, 
Brighton, 
East Sussex, 
BN1 3XE 
United Kingdom ?
+44(0)20 3564 5819?

I suspect that hotels.com book the rooms and then sell them on at a profit (it's ?89 per night, average).  If you're room sharing, I suggest forming groups and nominating a person to make the booking.  I'd also recommend doing this as soon as possible as the rooms will become progressively more expensive.  


Kind regards,

Pete

Hi

Might also be worth trying lastminute.com e.g.

http://globaltrips.lastminute.com/trips/hotellist/listInternal?pTxId=659714&startIndex=0&checkInDate=2013-09-12&checkOutDate=2013-09-16&hotelMaxReturnPerPage=25&guestCounts=2&guestCodes=ADULT&city=brighton&configId=S72722479&numRooms=1&sortBy=price&path=hotels

Regards

Tim

Hi Otto,
thanks for your reply and suggestions.
If this were only my problem, I mean the Saturday.Sunday night, then a 
solution would be easy to find. But  I believe that many other people 
has the same problem and I totally agree with the Paolo (for some 
assistance and that scattering around is not the best solution).
Maybe writing a "definitive" list of who needs a place to stay can help.

Thanks anyway!

Matteo

Hi,

Tim, could you quickly state how to proceed on these pull requests? I think
I remember your last mail stated something like "no more tinkering with
icons". Would be great if we could have a final decision.

Best wishes,
Anita

I'm ok to make an exclusion for this, but in general we should discourage
people from making any new gui tweaks so that we can start getting
promotional materials etc in place.

Hi Tim,

These requests have been open for more than a month.
I have sent several times an email to get a final decision on this, each 
time without success.
I don't mind if they are not accepted for any reason, but not if they 
are just forgotten.

For these two, I have just decided not to try anymore...
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/723
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/706

I sent this email just for the pan icon since it seemed to me there was 
an agreement that it should be changed and also 2.0 is at the corner...

Regards,

Denis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SEXTANTE rename Pull Request
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7yuNV0rsmkjuy7yKSCsu6S-Awfgj0boO6V9QGMJMxJvsg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey

I have just made a pull request[1] which contains a full renaming of
"sextante" to "processing". Most of it is an automated renaming, but I
made some manual changes as well, and just renamed packages and
classes to something  different.

If someone can take a look at it and merge, that would be great.

Once it is done, I will start working on rebranding the documentation,
which I think will require more manual editing, but it is not so
urgent/risky

Thanks!
Victor

Hi!

Regarding the change of the official name From Quantum GIS to QGIS it
should be done ..
I don't know if this can easily be done but what about waiting for the
2.0 release (because of the bugfixes made against the repository) and
changing the name after 2.0 is out?

kind regards
Werner

It might give a few some troubles to understand what's happening, but we 
can expect people using git to be able to change the name of the remote 
repo and to be somehow on one of the mailing list.

and this will not affect end-users.

Hi,

Seems like something is not working correctly when building the OSGeo4W  
nightlies. There haven't been any new versions for a few days now.

Best wishes,

FYI: github supports a "redirection" mode so changing local repos is not 
urgent for anyone.

Message-ID: <MWSJHBMC055ced6cafb0464d5994d4fcce78a347e7@MWSJHBMC05>

Dear list, 

I've come across two errors when digitising with QGIS Master:

1. When digitising lines or polygons, pressing the delete or backspace key erases the second-last, and not the last point digitised. This is with QGIS 1.9.0-Master, QGIS code revision d61cb25 on Windows XP.

2. QGIS crashes when pressing the delete or backspace keys while digitising lines or polygons. This is with the latest nightly build of QGIS 1.9.0-Master on Ubuntu 13.04.

Can anyone confirm these?

Frank.

Dear list, 

 I've come across two errors when digitising with QGIS Master:

 1. When digitising lines or polygons, pressing the delete or backspace key erases the second-last, and not the last point digitised. This is with QGIS 1.9.0-Master, QGIS code revision d61cb25 on Windows XP.

 2. QGIS crashes when pressing the delete or backspace keys while digitising lines or polygons. This is with the latest nightly build of QGIS 1.9.0-Master on Ubuntu 13.04.

 This should be fixed by this
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/818

 Cheers,

 Denis

 Can anyone confirm these?

 Frank.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to render a transparent raster layer on top of
 one or more vector layers with PyQgis?
Message-ID: <BAY173-W43FC8F59327671FA505AB48E400@phx.gbl>

I been trying to render a map with a 3 vector layers and one raster 
layer. The idea is that the raster layer should be on top of the other 3
 vector layers. The problem is that even when I add the transparency 
parameters to the Raster Layer I can't visualize the vector layers. In 
other words, the Raster Layer completely covers the area.

#!/usr/bin/python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
from qgis.core import *
from qgis.gui import *
from qgis.utils import *

from PyQt4.QtCore import *
from PyQt4.QtGui import *

QgsApplication.setPrefixPath("/usr", True)

QgsApplication.initQgis()

# raster layer
filename = "points.png"
file_info = QFileInfo(filename)
base_name = file_info.baseName()

l_raster = QgsRasterLayer(filename, base_name)
l_raster.setCrs( QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem(4326, QgsCoordinateReferenceSystem.EpsgCrsId) )
l_raster.setTransparency(20) 

l_a = QgsVectorLayer("a.MIF", "Layer A", "ogr")
l_b = QgsVectorLayer("b.MIF", "Layer B", "ogr")
l_c  = QgsVectorLayer("c.MIF", "Layer C", "ogr")

if not l_raster.isValid():
  print "Raster Layer failed to load!"  

if not l_a.isValid():
  print "A Layer failed to load!"

if not l_b.isValid():
  print "B Layer failed to load!"

if not l_c.isValid():
  print "C Layer failed to load!"  

QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(l_raster)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(l_a)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(l_b)
QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(l_c)

# create image
img = QImage(QSize(800,600), QImage.Format_ARGB32_Premultiplied)

# set image's background color
color = QColor(255,255,255)
img.fill(color.rgb())

# create painter
p = QPainter()

render.setLayerSet(lst)

# set extent

rect.scale(1)
render.setExtent(rect)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] QgsFeature addAttribute to writer
Message-ID: <4EC6E9E9-C469-4FA5-9E01-E487807A4A76@gmail.com>

Hej,
Is it possible to add an attribute to the writer when writing a geometry? It would appear this would be possible as explained in the 1.8 docs here (http://www.qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/vector.html#writing-vector-layers). However when I attempt something similar in 2.0 
I received the following errors

writer = QgsVectorFileWriter(Output, "CP1250", fields, layer.dataProvider().geometryType(),layer.crs(), "ESRI Shapefile")
fet = QgsFeature()
fet.addAttribute(0, QVariant(1)) 
AttributeError: 'QgsFeature' object has no attribute 'addAttribute' 
fet.setAttributeMap( { 0 : QVariant(1) }) 
AttributeError: 'QgsFeature' object has no attribute 'setAttributeMap' 

Currently I have a work around by creating a dictionary keyed by the feature id (i.e. corresponding to the order in which the geometries are created) and then looping through the layer a second time and updating the attributes. It appears that this second loop is unnecessary if I can write the attributes when writing the geometries to the QgsFeature().

Cheers,
Bjorn

Hi Bjorn,

The API has changed in 2.0.   You can now just do this:

writer = QgsVectorFileWriter(Output, "CP1250", fields,
layer.dataProvider().geometryType(),layer.crs(),
"ESRI Shapefile")
fields = layer.pendingFields()
feature = QgsFeature(fields)
feature[0] = 1

Save it as .ini and copy in resources/customization.ini, that should
be loaded as default customization when the user runs QGIS the first

Hi Kari,

Looks to me like your qgis executable is trying to run with a library 
(libqgis_*.so) it is not built against (maybe the master executable is 
trying to run with a 1.8 library). You probably have compiled qgis 
yourself?
You can have a look here for setting the library path 
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/5859
And you can also rebuild / reinstall your qgis to make sure you have 
matching library and executable.

Cheers

Hi List,

We still haven't a fully functional website ready for QGIS 2.0

We have been struggling with our current tool chain (Sphinx Bootstrap) 
to work as we want for the website part.

Currently there is discussion about either moving away from that 
toolchain to eg Pelican (for website only, docs is doing ok), or 
changing to a theme like this:
https://github.com/ryan-roemer/sphinx-bootstrap-theme
Which maybe would make it possible to have translated menu's etc.

The idea is to have a public discussion about it on friday morning 23th 
of aug on IRC. If you are interested please join us.

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Hi all,

in latest master there is an inconsistency in icons for "pan" action.
"Pan map" action has icon with hand, while "Pan to selection" still
used four-directional arrow. For me this is worse than having two
similar icons.

Should we revert 66a7afa8e669504 or homogenize "Pan to selection"
icon to make icons consistent? Opinions?

I'd go for homogenization as we all agreed that the "hand" icon is the
one to use IIRC!

Hi,

There was ? discussion open for ? while on the pull request.

Please refer to it, I did propose some other icon for pan to selected, especially one with an arrow.

I do agree that keeping the 4 cross icon was not the best choice though it was the result of the discussion.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Digitizing behavior
Message-ID: <CANxjxaqJpuBzW7RY2O8rifJXRnSzsP=Aev7ob-W=PcYDzHnx2A@mail.gmail.com>

I'm noticing that while digitizing a new feature which overlaps another,
the latter is at the top although I expect to see it at the bottom, so the
new feature should overlap to the existent one.

I was wondering if this was the correct behavior since other GIS software
have a different behavior.

Do you think we can change this for the upcoming 2.0?

Best Regards

 Hi Salvatore,

 I think you described it wrong: the former is on the top and not the 
 latter. If the latter were at the top it would be more logical and like 
 the other GIS.

 I agree that the current QGIS behavior is strange and I wonder why this 
 happens. Aren't objects rendered by its order in a table unless there 
 are other rules?

 Andreas

not sure but to-be-commited features have negative IDs. It might be a 
reason they are rendered first.

 I just tested with a new Shapefile - no difference before and after the 
 save.

 It seems that the newest feature always gets row id 0 and the other 
 features get incremented - this is very odd and against every behavior 
 of other spreadsheets and databases.

 But I am pretty sure that earlier versions did not show this behavior.

 I just tried to remove the layer, add it again. Then the behavior 
 changes a bit. New features still appear at the bottom, but after a save 
 they move back to the top.

 Definitely something is broken.

 Can you open a blocker, Salvatore?

 Thanks,
 Andreas

Unless it's a regression or causes data corruption I'm not a fan of making
it as a blocker.

the patch solves the problem only on digitizing of the first feature the
next are to the bottom !

 same here. Only the first new feature appears at the top, the 
 subsequent ones are again at the bottom.

Hi all.
On Windows, in rev b429bcf, I cannot drag&drop shapefiles to PostGIS; 
getting systematical built-in method name of QgsVectorLayer object at 
0x10DC2E40
Does anyone confirm? Is this a real bug?
All the best.

IMHO the render order should be considered arbitrary. The provider doesn't
return the features in a particular order later anyway.

Currently (w/o Matthias patch) while the layer is edited feature with changed
geometries are rendered first (ie. bottom), then added features and then
features from the provider (- those that are going to be deleted).

I don't think that this must be changed.  If a layer can have overlapping
features, it probably should be configured to show them transparently already.

Agreed,

There is no order promissed by the iterators (and if there was, there
should be a explicitly stated z-index / an ORDER BY clause specified to
the iterator).

But if these patches make the usage feel more natural, I think they
should be applied. As they affect a rather central part of QGIS, a
review would be much appreciated.

Yes, you're right and this is a particular case and we can use transparency
if there are overlapping features,
mine was only a reflection on how other software behaved with such a
similar thing.

Nevertheless my vote is for apply Matthias's patch!

It just might have an impact on other stuff (that false rely on new features
being returned first; maybe in the attribute table, snapping, some user
plugins).  Not sure if it actually does.

Thank you.
The attribute table shouldn't, others will have the possibility to 
implement their required order themselves.
I'm going to merge this.

I am not a big fan of changing such fundamental things shortly before
the release either - there's too much risk in breaking something.

If I am not wrong, with the patch from Matthias the existing features
with changed geometry that have been moved outside the filter
rectangle still get returned - something that should not happen.

Hi all,

The bug 'Cannot rename layers in composer legend' has been opened because :
1) users cannot update rasterlayer label
2) users cannot update vector layer simple symbol label

I finalized the 2 points with the pull request 824
https://github.com/qgis/Quantum-GIS/pull/824

If it is good for you I can merge it.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Missing nightly
Message-ID: <52fde2916703b1d0528d3cc4a0b2f8b1@mail.faunalia.it>

Hi all.
Currently, nightly is not available for debian: any hope to have it 
soon?
Are there complete packages for the previous days?
Thanks a lot.

Hi all.
Today is not my lucky day:

* nightly wheezy_amd64 is broken
* I cannot find a coherent set of packages in
http://qgis.org/debian-nightly/pool/main/q/qgis/
(some from 20130815, some from 20130818)
* compilation stops with an error:
cd /usr/local/src/Quantum-GIS/debian/build/src/gui && /usr/bin/cmake

Anyone has a hint on how to get a recent deb for my system?

Thanks.

Not conclusive.  The actual error isn't visible in the output.

Hi,

An update on this. Designing an appropriate test suite for labeling turned
out to be much more involved than anticipated (go figure). I have the base
suite set up but need help from other test server administrators before the
output from the QGIS Server tests can have a good crosscheck of output. In
the meantime, I'll do what I can to fix/test issue #8068 using local
virtual machines for Win7 and Ubuntu, in addition to my Mac. I still have
to make the unit test class for Composer output.

Once completed, the labeling test suite will work like so:

* Individual label variation tests are added to
test_qgspallabeling_tests.py. Those are inherited by each of the labeling
output test case classes (canvas, composer and server, etc.). This means
for each individual test added there will be 9 new tests run by the suite
(see next). This is critical for testing that labels look the same
regardless of output (that's the goal, anyways).

* Each of the output test case classes compares against a control image,
with the composer and server outputs also crosschecked against the canvas
output control images. The composer classes will compare all three variants
of output: image, PDF, SVG. Since the latter two will need to be
subsequently rasterized, running the full test suite may take awhile.

* Anomalies for tests will be collected and added where appropriate. There
is the possibility that control images may need to be saved per each of the
3 major platforms, given the variations on text rendering, to realistically
approach a higher percentage of valid tests. However, I would like to avoid
such platform-specific control images, if possible.

I initially expect *many* failed individual tests (> 75%). Any
help/comments on test suite design is appreciated and welcome. Again, the
suite will initially be to verify that fixes for 2.0 blocking issues are
good to go, then more tests will be added.

Regards,

Larry

Hi Larry,
thanks for looking into this. Any hope to have #8068 fixed in time for
qgis2 release?
All the best.

Based on other threads and IRC I was under the impression that old
labeling and old styling would no longer be available in the GUI but
that the code for them would still exist so that old projects could
still be opened and appear as they should. So those would be somewhat
read-only until you switched to the current system for labeling and styling.

Maybe I've misunderstood the question or conversation though.

Thanks,
Alex

Right, I remember that too. Anyway, currently old labeling is still in the  
GUI. So I guess my main question is: Will the GUI entry be removed before  
the release?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Unit testing QGIS Server, assistance requested
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR8AKAkJ9gcthRSaPj--YKWP=gqOd2imx54FXRJ0K+Z_tg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Today I committed a simple Python interface to running queries to a local
QGIS Server [0] (qgis_local_server.py). This was to aid in creating unit
tests for labeling, but could be used for other tests/purposes. It requires
an existing, running Server available via TCP/IP. It can be run directly
from command line, to aid in testing configuration, just make sure
<qgis-build-dir>/output/python is on sys.path.

Until build/test servers are updated with access to a local test Server,
all associated Server unit tests will be skipped. I am requesting that,
where possible, any of those servers be configured with a local test QGIS
Server.

Before I continue explaining how to setup the local server configuration
for tests, I have to ask: is there a better way to control qgis_map_serv
via Python? Seems like in addition to FCGI, offering some type of WSGI
interface would be very nice. I have an idea for a standalone, spawned
local test server, noted below.

Configuring local test QGIS Server for tests:

1) After attempting to run first invocation of any labeling unit tests
(labeling is only place it is used so far), a configuration file should be
created at: <current user>/.qgis2/qgis_local_server.cfg. You can set server
access url parameters in that file...

[LocalServer]  (my setup on Mac)
protocol = http
host = qgis-server-test.localhost
port = 8888
fcgipath = /fcgi-bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi
sourceurl = %(protocol)s://%(host)s:%(port)s%(fcgipath)s
projdir = /test-projects/tests

2) The config setting of 'projdir' needs to be writeable by the test/script
runner and readable by the local QGIS Server. This allows a unit test to
copy to that directory a project.qgs with associated .qml files and and
data sources. The running Server can access that project via the MAP url
parameter. See example under __main__ in qgis_local_server.py.

3) A unit test calls the QgisLocalServerConfig.getMap(url_params) and
receives a tuple of the result success and path to output as a PNG file
(for render comparison checks).

4) Since qgis_map_serv is FCGI, any running instance will need to be
re-spawned before unit tests are run against it, so new changes pulled from
git repo will be reflected. I have my qgis_map_serv.fcgi set up as a
symlink from <qgis-build-dir>/output/bin/qgis_mapserv.fcgi. This is one
example of where having a locally spawned instance of qgis_map_serv will
help.


Running qgis_map_serv as a locally spawned process for unit testing (my
proposal):

* Add spawn-fcgi source code [1] from lighttpd to <qgis-src>/tests/. It has
an optional cmake build setup, which can be integrated into QGIS's. It has
(I believe) a compatible license [2].

* When building QGIS with ENABLE_TESTS, spawn-fcgi is built and used to
launch qgis_map_serv in a fixture at the beginning of unit tests. I have
used a similar setup to run QGIS Server successfully under Nginx.

* Add a lightweight, pure python module that creates a standalone HTTP
server that connects as a FCGI client to the spawned qgis_map_serv. There
are several choices for this, most under permissive/compatible licenses,
e.g. Flup [2]. Then, QgisLocalServerConfig's qgis_local_server.cfg can be
hard-coded to this standalone server.

Any ideas on a different setup, or comments on this one? I think it would
be good to have a standalone test server for unit tests.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Need help with Plugin button behavior connected to
	SIGNAL("selectionChanged()")
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_ESUYjzoBMOPQF1BtBk0XLCpgjK_gMpus7kczkU4xk02g@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm updating the Multipart split
plugin<http://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/splitmultipart/> to
make it work with the 2.0 API.

Has I have successfully updated the plugin to make it work in 2.0, I would
like to improve it's button behavior to work like the rest of the advanced
editing toolbar. I am able to enable and disable it if the current layer is
editable.

Now I'm trying to get the same behavior if there are selected features. I
have made it work, but QGIS starts to get really slow... I found out that's
because lots of connections are being created to
SIGNAL("selectionChanged()").

Can someone please, point me in the right direction, or tell me where can I
find some code example doing this?

Thank you very much,

Alexandre Neto

Part of the code bellow:

def initGui(self):
        # Create action that will start plugin configuration
        self.action = QAction(
            QIcon(":/plugins/splitmultipart/icon.svg"),
            QCoreApplication.translate('Multipart split', u"Split Selected
Multipart features"), self.iface.mainWindow())
        self.action.setEnabled(False)

        # connect to signals for button behavior
        QObject.connect(self.action, SIGNAL("triggered()"), self.run)
        QObject.connect(self.iface,
SIGNAL("currentLayerChanged(QgsMapLayer*)"), self.toggle)
        #QObject.connect(self.iface, SIGNAL("selectionChanged(QgsMapLayer
*)"), self.toggle)

        # Add toolbar button and menu item
        self.iface.advancedDigitizeToolBar().addAction(self.action)
        self.iface.editMenu().addAction(self.action)

    def toggle(self):
        mc = self.canvas
        layer = mc.currentLayer()

        # Decide whether the plugin button is enable or disable
        if layer <> None:
            # set enable
            if layer.isEditable():

QObject.connect(layer,SIGNAL("editingStopped()"),self.toggle)
                QObject.connect(layer, SIGNAL("selectionChanged()"),
self.toggle)

QObject.disconnect(layer,SIGNAL("editingStarted()"),self.toggle)
                self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage("Debug"," Connect
SIGNAL(selectionChanged()",0)
                if layer.selectedFeatureCount() > 0:
                    self.action.setEnabled(True)
                else:
                    self.action.setEnabled(False)

            # set disable
            else:
                self.action.setEnabled(False)

QObject.connect(layer,SIGNAL("editingStarted()"),self.toggle)

QObject.disconnect(layer,SIGNAL("editingStopped()"),self.toggle)
                QObject.disconnect(layer, SIGNAL("selectionChanged()"),

                self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage("Debug"," Disconnect

This is not going to solve you problem yet but this is a quick refactor to
use the new style signal slot syntax:

def initGui(self):
        # Create action that will start plugin configuration
        self.action = QAction(
            QIcon(":/plugins/splitmultipart/icon.svg"),
            QCoreApplication.translate('Multipart split', u"Split Selected
Multipart features"), self.iface.mainWindow())
        self.action.setEnabled(False)

        # connect to signals for button behavior
        self.action.triggered.connect(self.run)
        self.iface.currentLayerChanged.connect(self.toggle)

        # Add toolbar button and menu item
        self.iface.advancedDigitizeToolBar().addAction(self.action)
        self.iface.editMenu().addAction(self.action)

    def toggle(self, layer):
        mc = self.canvas
        layer = mc.currentLayer()

        # Decide whether the plugin button is enable or disable
        if layer:
            # set enable
            if layer.isEditable():
                layer.editingStopped.connect(self.toggle)
                layer.editingStarted.disconnect(self.toggle)
                layer.selectionChanged.connect(self.toggle)

                self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage("Debug"," Connect
SIGNAL(selectionChanged()",0)
                if layer.selectedFeatureCount() > 0:
                    self.action.setEnabled(True)
                else:
                    self.action.setEnabled(False)
            # set disable
            else:
                self.action.setEnabled(False)
                layer.editingStarted.connect(self.toggle)
                layer.editingStopped.disconnect(self.toggle)
                layer.selectionChanged.disconnect(self.toggle)
                self.iface.messageBar().pushMessage("Debug"," Disconnect
SIGNAL(selectionChanged()",0)

Hi Alexandre,

Why don't you use selectionChanged on mapCanvas?
You have a line commented, I suppose this was it.

Mainly, I suppose the problem is that you never disconnect you layer 
from the signals since you always call the method for the current 
layer....so the previous current is never disconnected....

Hope this helps,

Cheers,

Denis

Alexandre,

I have included your tool in the DigitizingTools plugin [1] as I have 
told you the other day. DigitizingTools is already QGIS 2.0 ready 
(though still marked as experimental). Feel free to join this effort.

Concerning your problem I reckon you have the same signal connected many 
times thus slowing down QGIS. See the enable method in any of the 
digitizing tools, e.g. [2] how I solved it.

regards

Bernhard

Btw, I have created a pull request for this. Hopefully, it will be in 
core for 2.1 !

Denis,

You were right, using selectionChanged on mapCanvas worked just fine.

Thanks!

Alexandre Neto


this worked just great. I guess I had been in the right direction before,
but some how lost it.

Hello Nathan,

After I resolved my problem with Denis suggestion I tried to apply your
refactor to use the new style. The code seems much simpler. But I got two
errors while running it (see code below).

If I add 'layer' as an argument for the toggle function, I get the
following error. It works without the change, can you please explain why
should layer be passed as an argument too?

An error has occured while executing Python code:
> TypeError: toggle() takes exactly 2 arguments (1 given)
> Python version:
> 2.7.4 (default, Apr  6 2013, 19:54:46) [MSC v.1500 32 bit (Intel)]
> Traceback (most recent call last):

> line 84, in toggle
>     layer.editingStopped.disconnect(self.toggle)
> TypeError: 'instancemethod' object is not connected
>

Also, trying to use,

layer.editingStopped.disconnect(self.toggle)


instead of,

QObject.disconnect(layer,SIGNAL("editingStopped()"),self.toggle)


Gives me this other error:

An error has occured while executing Python code:
> Traceback (most recent call last):

Thank you very much for your help,

Alexandre Neto

Hey Alexandre,

Just a refectoring mistake. I noticed that selectionChanged passes a layer
then forgot that you are connecting other signals which don't.

You get that type error if the self.toggle is not connected to any signals,
you can just wrap it in a try block.

It worked well!

Actually, looking into Bernhard code I have found the same solution (the
try block).

Thank you, Nathan, Denis and Bernhard for all your help.

Hi Radim, 

thanks a lot for your answer!! :) 

Do you also know if there is a way to adjust the QGIS options in the new
installer. For example I want the "On-the-fly-projection"-option to be
activated, when QGIS is started. Is it possible to include that in the
installer? 


Thanks!
Christina

Hi all.
While searching for the announcement of the roadmap to 2.0 release, I noticed that we
have a number of annouuncements, wiki pages, etc, scattered over the net.
It would be better to update or remove most of them, and point to a single documents,
possibly the original post:
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2013-August/023482.html
or some rewriting of it. Opinions? And, anyway, Sunday is supposed to be the Point of
no return (we still have 8 blockers[0] and 49 high relevance tickets[1]): are we
going to meet and discuss about this?
All the best.

Given the short amount of available time, I'd like to single out this bug:

http://hub.qgis.org/issues/6299

which causes the outputs to have a different encoding from the input. This
can potentially mess up analysis conducted with .shp with non-ascii
characters.

I believe Victor Olaya wont be able to fix this in time. so if there's
anyone else wiling and able to fix it it would be most appreciated
(particularly who speak languages who require special characters).

I suppose there must be an easy way to move them from one project (sextante) to
another (qgis desktop), right?
Anyone knowledgeable with redmine?

The subject is quite criptic but that's what it seems to happen.

Yesterday I've built from master on a Ubuntu 12.04 Virtual Machine.
Everything went smooth, tests were ok, and I could use qgis_mapserv.fcgi
Then I've started QGIS desktop and after loading up (splash screen
disappears) I obtain an empry window and then... I can't do anything in my
Virtual Machine because it becomes unresponsive, the disk led always on and
the fan starts running. A couple of times I've got segfault.

Previous builds worked fine (some weeks ago)

Did anybody face something similar?

Hi,

After right or left clicking the interface legend in an empty space,

iface.mapCanvas.currentLayer() == None

Shouldn't currentLayerChanged() signal be thrown? It does not seem to.

I can not verify the same behavior on Mac. As far as I can tell, it is
working like that already. In console:

def print_active_layer(layer):
    print layer

iface.currentLayerChanged["QgsMapLayer *"].connect(print_active_layer)

Changing the active layer, including clicking in empty space emits the
signal.

A while back, I made several changes that separated the visual feedback
between active layer and current selection. For example, you can have no
selection and still have an active layer. This is important to how
selections should function and is more inline with other GUIs. Active
layers are now represented with an underlined layer name.

For example, clicking on a symbology row, under a layer, will clear the
selection (but not the active layer), and clicking empty space with clear
both the selection and active layer.

Regards,

Larry

Assuming you intend to go ahead with 1 Sept tagging, will we still be able
to commit to the master branch in between 25 Aug and 1 Sept?

If so, I believe I can wrap up work on some important labeling issues. The
time-consuming project I was doing at my day job will be done on Monday,
after which I can devote most of my time to finishing the work I've done on
labeling.

Hi Larry,

Thanks for the fast answer. You were right, testing in the console I got
the same results as you. Clicking in a white space send the currentLayerChanged
signal also in linux.

So I have double checked my code and... it was my bad, Sorry. I found a bug
in my code, that was not running when currentLayer == None.

Regards,

Alexandre Neto

I would say having an alias isn't going to hurt. For me that would also be
good as it would allow old code to keep working without needing to do any
updates.

The alias is not a bad idea, but, how many such plugins exist? 4? 5?.
It's pretty easy to rename and adapt them, and then we leave no traces
of sextante imports in their code, which will make them probably
easier to understand, mantain, etc

Can be call plugin devs and tell them to adapt them (just like we did
for the SIP API change, vector API change, etc...)?. I guess that
would be the better way to solve this issue

Thanks for pointing out this problem

Cheers

Message-ID: <20130825154730.27656650@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

I have some vector layers in a postgis2 database, provide them via QGIS
server (ubuntu package from master) and visualize with QGIS webclient. In
qgis-web-client-error.log I get following error

"malformed header from script. Bad header=credentials for dbname='testdb':"

I set up the qgs project file on my local PC and the error occurs, when I
copy the file to the server, where postgis and QGIS server is installed.

Thanks for any hints

Otto

 Hi Otto,

 This is most likely a QGIS project issue.

 Perhaps you did not save the db connection credentials in the data 
 source? You should save both user and password in your project file.

 Matthias Kuhn came up with a saver solution where one does not have to 
 store the credentials - but I can't find it now.

 Andreas

The credentials in the project file are incomplete and therefore the server
asks for username and password - which causes the webserver to complain that
that's not a HTTP header.

You should either complete the credentials into the project file, setup
pg_hba.conf of your database to trust connections from the webserver or use
the webservers user's .pgpass.

Hi all.
Of the few blockers left, two are of exclusive interest of local communities:
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7941 for France
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8487 for South Africa
This is the last occasion for these communities to fix these issues in time for the
release of QGIS 2.0.
Please consider fixing them yourself, or hiring a developer to have it fixed very
soon. Beware, the window is *really* narrow.
All the best.

Hi all.
Of the 8 blockers, two are of local interest, two are probably difficult to fix
quickly, but two are workable:
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8068 is being worked on
* http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7441 has a pull request.
Anyone has ideas on these? Are we able to fix it in time for 2.0 release?
All the best, and thanks.

Hi Paolo, 
I will see what I can do, but this is really late due to our capacity to
quickly fund work, and as we already funded bugfixing. I hope some other can
go for it now. 
Not having that bug solved is not an option here since Lambert 93 is the
mandatory CRS. That would lead to a funding of a bugfix release only for
france here. Paying all the repackaging only for one bugfix that didn't make
it in time will be overexpensive, unless a bugfix release 2.0.1 is planned
for the end of 2013. I would then consider public 2.0 as a release candidate
then. My guess is that testing was not sufficient for french users because
of.. summer holidays.. and maybe lack of contributors (we have many users,
but inside corps using 1.8 mainly)
 
R?gis

	Landscapes Working Group
Message-ID: <20130826095123.553f6804@nature.speedport.ip>

Dear Community,

we have a new QGIS case study written by Dr. Scott Madry. He is a research
associate professor in the Curriculum in Archaeology at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill?s Research Laboratories of Archaeology. 

Additionally he is on the faculty of the International Space University in
Strasbourg, France, and is a chercheur associ? du Laboratoire Arch?ologie et
Territoires de l'UMR 7324 CITERES, Universit? Fran?ois-Rabelais/CNRS

The case study is about the Burgundy Historical Landscapes Working Group.
They are trying to understand the changing patterns of human settlement
and land use over a period of 2,000 years from the Iron Age, Gallo-Roman,
Medieval periods into the present.

You find the whole story here:
http://www.qgis.org/en/community/qgis-case-studies/burgundy-region-france.html

Thank you very much Scott Madry for your contribution!

Kind Regards
Otto

Compared to 1.8 for the same crs, we didn't have nadgrids parameter where we
now have +nadgrids=@null

I tried to change srs definition in srs.db in \apps\qgis-dev\resources. 
LAMB93 (srs_id = 10089), trying to have a 1.8 like def but it didn't do the
trick. 

I also checked the grid, and Checksum for the file is the same between 1.8
and master. 

Any idea why the grid is not loaded correctly?

Hi all,

For the problem with South African CRSs, is this not a simple fix, i.e. 
edit the proj4 parameters in the srs.db file to remove the +axis=wsu 
options from all the Lo CRSs? If so, does anyone know how to do it?

Regards, Frank.

How isn't the problem (that should be a simple update statement).

But is that a correct fix?    Are there more people annoyed by the current
entry, than people relying on it?   Is the existing EPSG entry wrong?

Could others from the southern hemisphere comment on that?  Tim?

Hello,

I may misunderstand this sentence about bug #7941 
<http://hub.qgis.org/issues/7941> : "on OSGeo4W the file "ntf_r93.gsb" 
is in the "proj-datumgrid" and the "proj" package depends on it. So it 
should be there."

In my case, the file "ntf_r93.gsb" is the proj folder but it does not 
work. I must miss something.

Regards,

Beno?t

Hi all,

The bug #7941 has been closed byGiovanni Manghi 
<http://hub.qgis.org/users/11> becauseregis Haubourg 
<http://hub.qgis.org/users/989> said that the problems comes from proj4.
The bug #7941 is not a proj4 bugs but QGIS packaging bug.

It seems that proj4 is not well packaging with QGIS and extracting by 
the installer.
The bug is confirmed for weekly qgis-master and not for qgis-master form 
OSGeo4W.

How Proj4 is packaging with QGIS ?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Append to PostGIS table
Message-ID: <CAJsc-7zkgi-HEY__NxkEhaHj5vKy3+CUP-CnPZBySEa_WTbRHA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to append a layer to a PostGIS table, but I am having
trouble. I am calling

QgsVectorLayerImport.importLayer(layer, uri.uri(), providerName,
layer.crs(), False, False, options)

with options['append'] = True, but it is not working (it complains
that the relation already exists, so I guess it is not actually
appending.

The DB manager uses this, but I haven't been able to make it work
either (the "Add to table" option it is actually never enabled...)

The PostGIS manager plugin is the only one that works for this, but it
calls shp2pgsql on the console, which is something that I would prefer
to avoid.

any ideas?

Thanks!

Hi all, 
it seems that file  %OSGEO4W_ROOT%\apps\grass\grass-6.4.3\etc\env.bat
is guilty, line 13

replacing :
/set PROJ_LIB=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\proj/

by:

/set PROJ_LIB=%OSGEO4W_ROOT%\share\proj
/
does the trick. 

Thanks to all those who worked on that so quickly (here: 
http://georezo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=237631#p237631
<http://georezo.net/forum/viewtopic.php?pid=237631#p237631>  )

I'll update the ticket now.

 Hi,

 I get an awful lot of log messages in the QT tab of the logging panel 
 with the following error message:

 QFSFileEngine::open: No file name specified
 Cannot open file '', because: No file name specified

 I get hundreds of these messages when opening a project. I have no idea 
 what files are missing.

 Do others have these log messages as well?

AFAIK this is just a placeholder, the function was never completed.
I think inmplementing it would be the way to go, however.
All the best.

If I can find out how to do it...i promise I will add it to the DB
manager as well, to complete that function :-)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Saga and sextante on OSX
Message-ID: <1D40029B-8716-4CC7-B4EE-FF55473DB497@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I'm running trunk on OS X 10.8 with qgis dependencies built from source (most using the homebrew package manager). I also have a functional saga_cmd binary that I can use in my terminal to produce valid outputs. Unfortunately, sextante complains when I try to run a function:

" Missing dependency.This algorithm cannot be run :-( 

This algorithm requires SAGA to be run.Unfortunately, it seems that SAGA is not installed in your system, or it is not correctly configured to be used from QGIS"

This perplexes me. The appropriate path, "/usr/local/bin" shows in my qgis preferences. Sextante was also working at least several months ago in trunk. Can anyone provide any suggestions on what may be causing this to not work?

Thanks,
John

If you are planning gui / other changes, maybe it would be better to wait
for 2.1?

No gui stuff, excepting maybe a couple of underlying gui code fixes (mostly
for dialogs that are too large for many laptops). Nothing that would affect
screen captures or strings. Unless... I can find the time to nix the
deprecated labeling tab from vector layer properties (which would be very
nice to have done).

Hi Larry,

All the best, and thanks.

Hi,

the situation is not fixed, today there are packages update to 26/08
and others still from 19/08 build.

Isn't this the disk space issue that we already had in the past?

No.  It's still the same diskspace issue.  I just retired the squeeze build
(old debian stable).  But it's a constant struggle to tidy up other stuff to
keep room for the builds...

Subject: [Qgis-developer] [qgis webclient] hide layer in menu
Message-ID: <20130828125847.24107f5e@nature.speedport.ip>

Hi,

if I want to hide the visibility of a layer in the qgis-weblient, so it is
not initially visible when I open the webclient in the browser but it
should still be possible to show the layer, if I want.

It seems that qgis webclient doesn't understand, if I hide the layer from
visibility in the QGIS project.

Is there a trick to achieve this?

Thanks
Otto

 Hi Otto,

 If you provide the "visibleLayers" property in the URL, it will be 
 used. If you do not provide this property it will use the visibility 
 setting from the QGIS?project. You need to set

 var useGetProjectSettings = true;

 to be able to use the visibility from the QGIS?project. It does not 
 work with GetCapabilities.

Message-ID: <CALuHMPB87GLrbMDpKEWRtLw3sqfzsMDeY3tT21Autzgzxz6B4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

two days ago ticket #8510 [0] about moving Processing tickets to QGIS redmine
was closed. As I can see, now processing is subproject of the QGIS project.

But seems it still separate project and not accessible from main QGIS redmine.
Moreover, there is a new category "processing" (with only one ticket in it)
under QGIS redmine. For me this is much more confusing now: category under
QGIS redmine (maybe it should be renamed to "Processing" to be consistent
with other categories?) and separate bugtracker.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] X11: Map canvas flicker
Message-ID: <521DF524.1050507@gmx.ch>

Hi,

About a year ago I developed a fix for the flickering problem on X11.
This has some major disadvantages like a rendering process cannot be
aborted with the "Esc" key and apparently there have been some artifacts
on dock windows (although this seem to have disappeared magically)

However, recently Donovan Cameron came up with a comment [1] which
solves the flickering issue without the drawbacks of the workaround
currently in place.
As the merge window is almost closed, I would like to point to pull
request 834 [2] and ask, if there is any objection to merging this. It
should only affect linux systems, but resolves a a long-standing and
annoying issue there.

Any feedback on this is appreciated.
Regards,
Matthias

Your explanation sounds good - if it really is like that and it really

Hi Matthias,
thanks a lot for your efforts to get QGIS 2.0 as stable as possible.

Sadly, my vote here is -1 as I just tested your branch and I still getting
the map flickering,
not frequently as before but by using measure tool or shaking the map
sometime it happens.

Might this be an isolated case on my linux machine ?

Best Regards,

-SL

Just tested patch and I still get white stripes when measuring

Thanks for testing.
I realized, that this also happens here, so this patch gets my -1 as 
well in its current state.
But this will still improve the situation for people which cannot turn 
on backbuffering because they need to be able to interrupt the 
rendering process or need incremental drawing.

On the other hand, this could easily be done by setting an environment 
variable (and therefore does not need any patch and is easily 
changeable if bad side-effects occur). So instead of applying something 
to the source, this could by done by setting the environment variable 
"QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM=X11" by e.g. requesting the packagers to modify the 
qgis.desktop file to include "Exec=env QT_GRAPHICSSYSTEM=X11 
/usr/bin/qgis"

This solution could also easily be backported to older releases of QGIS 
without having to release a patched source.

if you are running with SAGA 2.0.8, there should be an option under
Processing-->Processing options in SAGA Provider ticks "Enable SAGA 2.0.8
compatibility". That should allow you to run SAGA algs.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] polygon symbology fill style blurry in mapcomposer
	when called from python
Message-ID: <CAHMvJdQNLZwA6Nf7tef=sP5VZLvCiGmE3y=nagXTqZ=4aa6WPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I'm trying to generate a pdf via pyqgis using QgsComposition. Its going
ok, but I've got a little problem with polygon fill symbology. Any of the
fill styles such as 'cross', 'horizontal', 'diagonal_x' when used in a
polygon show up blurry in the output (all other linework is sharp).
Here is how I'm setting the symbology:

    layer = QgsVectorLayer(cropProbVectorFilename, "probcrop", "ogr")
    symbol = QgsFillSymbolV2.createSimple({QString('style'):
QString('diagonal_x'),
                                           QString('color'):
QString('0,0,0,255'),

QString('style_border'):QString('solid')})

    layer.setRendererV2( QgsSingleSymbolRendererV2( symbol ) )

    QgsMapLayerRegistry.instance().addMapLayer(layer)
    layerset.append(layer.getLayerID())
    ....
    myMapRenderer = QgsMapRenderer()
    myMapRenderer.setProjectionsEnabled(True)

    myMapRenderer.setLayerSet(layerset)
    comp = QgsComposition(myMapRenderer)
    comp.setPlotStyle(QgsComposition.Print)



Is there something in the symbol I can set to correct this, or perhaps its
in the composer?

Thanks

Robert

Hi all.
Testing the latest QGIS weekly on Windows 7, I encounter a couple of
issues:
* GRASS appears configured, but it does not run, pretending the path
is not set; this might be related to the localisation of the path (I'm
working in Italian SO)
* the window warning of this issue has a link that should explain, but
it is broken.
Should I open tickets?
Thanks.

Does it point to the correct GRASS folder? By default it should point
to the OSGeo4W installation, which does not contain any strange
character...

This seems easy to fix, but please fill a ticket if you have time

not for weekly: it goes to Programmi (x86)/QGIS Weekly etc
I suppose for final standalone it will be similar

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Tutorial Atlas
Message-ID: <521F3677.6030409@heurisis.eu>

Hello,

I encounter difficulties to understand the Atlas generation.

I read the user manual related to this fonctionnality 
(http://documentation.qgis.org/2.0/html/en/docs/user_manual/print_composer/print_composer.html#atlas-generation) 
but it is still fuzzy for me. Is there a complete tutorial or a sample 
somewhere ? I saw this link http://www.oslandia.com/tech/?p=1079 but it 
is broken.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Regards,

Beno?t

Hello,

I don't know of any tutorial, but, maybe we can help.

Atlas generation allows you to, for one single map in your print composer
map, create a set of similar maps, but with different extents,
labels\titles and even
images<http://nyalldawson.net/2013/04/a-neat-trick-in-qgis-2-0-images-in-atlas-prints/>(e.g.,
a company logo). All this dynamic info must be in a already loaded
layer.

Lets say you need to make a map for each of your municipality's green
parks, having a layer with each park boundaries and it's name.

- Start by preparing a map like if it's for a single park in the print
composer. Add a map, a title or two, a legend and so on.
- Then go to the atlas generation tab, tick the "generate atlas".
- In composer map choose your main map (if you only have one generally its
map 0),
- For coverage map select your green parks layer.

>From now on, when you try to output you map in any format (Print or
export), QGIS will iterate over your Green park features, zoom or pan your
map to each, and produce a individual output (a file or a print) for it.

Of course various configurations can be made to fit your needs, like choose
if you want a fixed scale or a zoom to each feature, change each map title
with the green park name field.

Like explained in the user manual, you can also use any of the coverage
fields in your map labels.

Hope this helps,

Alexandre Neto

there is a way to have a layer always visible but do not have it in the TOC?

Hi Giovanni,

No - this is not possible yet. We can discuss this in Brighton.

Im about to push a pull-request from Lars Linger and Otto Dassau that
will enable Google/Bing maps as backgrounds - if that interests you. But
you have to stick to EPSG:3857.

Hi all,

sorry for bugging again, but there is any chance to see any of the
patches reviewd and committed before the release?

At least a couple should fix blockers and other are potentially fixing
important issues.

The time for testing them before the release is not a lot already...

thanks!

Hi Andreas,

will that be only Google/Bing or will there be a more general approach 
to have anything defined as base layer as discussed in [1]?

Hi,

Currently it is only Bing/Google. They plan to add OSM as well.

I personally don't care about this functionality, since I don't need
these base maps and I hate tiles - I think tiles have too many drawbacks
to justify them. If someone comes up with a better, more generic
approach I will accept it.

Also, people who use this functionality in their QGIS web client will
have to explain their users that the background maps are not printable.

Hi,

Would it be possible to add other backgrounds like openstreetmap or 
geoportail.fr for example?
It would be nice if we can select one of the different backgrounds like 
in lizmap.

Thanks

Hi,

at the moment only Google and Bing is implemented, but it would be possible
to add OSM and others as well (although I don't know about geoportail.fr).
We plan to improve it in Brighton, because there are still some things
to sort out to make it run properly, e.g. at the moment:

* transparency is not working properly with Layers from QGIS server and
* background layers (Google and Bing) are currently selectable as
  checkboxes together at the same time and this should be changed to radio
  buttons.

So any testing, ideas and solutions from the community are welcome, now that
it is part of qgis-web-client repo.

Regards
Otto

This is a point that I don't understand very well: do I have to create 
this layer manually ? Which type is it ?

At the present time, I just have a raster layer and many differents 
shapefiles containing lines or points.

Beno?t

I see...

As composer layer, you can use any vector layer available.

If what you are aiming to is some kind of mosaic of all your working area
using smaller maps (like an actual atlas), then you can use vector >
Research tools > Vector Grid, to create the coverage of the all working
area. You will have to figure out the X and Y parameters to fit you pages
scales.

Hope it helps,

Alexandre Neto

Subject: [Qgis-developer] function help gui files
Message-ID: <521F9047.2000001@gmail.com>

Hi guys,
we are "almost" finish with the Italian translation of the gui. I'm now 
ready to translate all the function_help files.
AFAIK all the function listed are standard function, so maybe you got 
them from another software, or unless somebody knows if there is a file 
where they are listened in English and maybe in Italian. I'm asking that 
because if there exist such a file we can just copy and paste all the 
strings and spend a lot of time.

Thanks

Matteo

Hi all.
What is the function:
Discourage labels from covering features
supposed to do? The description is unclear to me, and I cannot see an obvious effect
of it. This is needed to complete our translation.
Thanks a lot.

I had a try this morning. However, this is not really a mosaic that I 
want to create: my different shapefiles can overlap. With the Vector 
Grid Tool, I create a regular grid (unless I miss something).

Actually, what I wish to do is to capture the extent of my first 
shapefile layer, store it in the composer layer and iterate the process 
over the other shapefile layers. Is it possible in QGis ?

As far as I understand, QGis would then rely on this created composer 
layer to iterate over each extent. My problem rely lies in the creation 
of this composer layer.

Regards,

Beno?t

Please someone do. It would be too bad to miss potential fixes, so close to the release.

You can only iterate over one layer in one composer, at one time, but you can
show all the layers you want in the resulting maps. 

The layer that works as a iterator is define in the 'Coverage layer' in the
Atlas tab. The zoom level is either fixed to a predefined scale, or dynamic
set to the bound of each geometry of the Coverage layer, when the iterator
works through the records of the Coverage layer.

This feature is very powerful: Thanks goes to the sponsors and developers
for making this available :)

I am not quite sure what you mean by: "Actually, what I wish to do is to
capture the extent of my first shapefile layer, store it in the composer
layer and iterate the process over the other shapefile layers."

Regards
Jakob

Thanks Tim. It makes sense to me; in this case I would lower the priority of this issue.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to use QPyNullVariant() to "empty" primary key
 fields in spatialite layer
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_GAaOdLH3apig+mk=+zohAn_Lo3HR_feZ2Wf5Pf8wdW5Q@mail.gmail.com>

In the multipartsplit plugin [1] I'm trying to solve the primary key (pk)
fields problem in postgis and spatialite like in it was done in the
splitFeatures() [2]

I have no problems with Postgis provider, but in spatialite setting pk
fields to NULL does not work as I expected, and spatialite does not choose
a new non used id by it self. (Making it impossible to commit the changes
without manually introduce some id)

In splitFeatures() [2] when a field is in
provider.pkAttributeIndexes<http://www.qgis.org/api/classQgsVectorDataProvider.html#a6e19d018aa0b88da21fdb9d02c5e8a60>(),
but has no default value, the filed is set to empty with this

newAttributes[ pkIdx ] = QVariant();


But i'm not being able to use it in my code, since it's says QVariant() can
not be instantiated. Actually this is said in here [3]. And it says that
Null QVariant() are now converted in QPyNullVariant

Can I use QPyNullVariant to keep the pk field empty, so that
spatialite automatically choose a adequate int value? How?

I tried the code bellow but it did not work.

# Get attributes from original feature
> new_attributes = feature.attributes()
>


> # When attribute is a Primary Key, replace by provider default value



> for j in provider.pkAttributeIndexes():
>     if provider.defaultValue(j):
>         new_attributes[j] = provider.defaultValue(j)
>     else:
>         new_attributes[j] = QPyNullVariant('int')

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How to use QPyNullVariant() to "empty" primary

Hi Alexander,

You should be able to use either of the following:

attributes[j] = None
attributes[j] = NULL # first do: from qgis.core import NULL
attributes[j] = QPyNullVariant(int)

If this is not working, it should be considered a bug in the spatialite 
provider. I realized, there's used a lot of QVariant::Invalid and 
QVariant() instead of NULL QVariants initialized with QVariant( 
TypeName ) in the spatialite provider,  so I would not be surprised.

Cheers
Matthias

Subject: [Qgis-developer] SLD export problems GraphicFill element
Message-ID: <52206F93.2080302@gmail.com>

Hi,

I had posted on the user list some issues I was having when exporting an 
SLD ( http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-user/2013-August/023650.html)

Pocking around the code today, I saw what might be the issue with the 
generation of "invalid" sld with graphic fill and a graphic marker:

file qgssymbollayerv2utils.cpp  function  void 
QgsSymbolLayerV2Utils::fillToSld (around line 1523) :

    /* Use WellKnownName tag to handle QT brush styles. */
   wellKnownMarkerToSld( doc, graphicFillElem, patternName, fillColor, 
borderColor );

  The call to wellKnownMarkerToSld is using the graphicFillElem instead 
of the graphicElem

This, as discribe in the previous post produces:

<se:GraphicFill>
  <se:Graphic/>
  <se:Mark>
    ...
  </se:Mark>
</se:GraphicFill>
  

Instead of

<se:GraphicFill>
  <se:Graphic>
    <se:Mark>
    ...
   </se:Mark>
  
  </se:Graphic>
</se:GraphicFill>


Would it be possible for someone to confirm this issue?


regards,

Y. Assefa

That is precisely my problem. For the moment, I don't have any coverage 
layer. I would like to create it but I don't know how ? (manually ?)

It look promising indeed.

Actually, I would like to create this composer layer.

Hi all

I have another person who told me "I have weird label sizes with QGIS
Server".
Larry, sorry to ask again, but do you think you will be able to solve
http://hub.qgis.org/issues/8068 before the 1st ?

Thanks for any update, we can help by trying your branch if needed.

Thank you for the fast repplies. Meanwhile I found out that spatialite does
not like polygons writen in a multipolygon table... And have been trying to
solve that.


Anyway, both None and QPyNullVariant(int) works, only if the splitted
feature has only two parts.


If  the result has two or more new features I get this error:


Could not commit changes to layer poligonos
> Errors: ERROR: 2 feature(s) not added.

I fill function code is bellow.

It was a disabled option in the settings before with the following name
(changed in this commit [0]):

'Features don't act as obstacles for labels'

When looking at enabling the option, I noticed that 'features as obstacles'
is not an absolute, i.e. if PAL finds no candidate for the label outside of
the feature, it will place it over the feature. More info here [1].

This, unfortunately, has implications when looking into a solution for
keeping labels from being clipped at the extent border, e.g. when creating
server tiles.

I agree the wording is not the ideal. Any better wording would be
appreciated. The wording has to convey that PAL still may place a label
covering the feature(s).

Ugh! I was hoping to have that done by now, but several things conspired
against me this week. This is a very significant issue and very laborious
to test across platforms. Also, it appears to even be different between
host web servers (no idea how that's happening)!

I very much apologize for the delay in a fix. Here is why it is a
time-consuming fix:

* The difference in resolutions of output paint devices affects EVERYTHING
in the new labeling features (e.g. shadows, backgrounds). This is because
of the means in which I coded the 'storing' of the label component's
painting to canvas, so that I can use that info to later create the drop
shadows, etc. When I fix one part of the code, I have to *visually* test
many variations that might be affected (e.g. server, PDF and SVG exports).
This is because there were no unit tests for the labeling code at all (I
take responsibility for some of that).

* So... I made the uncomfortable decision to create a comprehensive
labeling test suite right now. The idea being, I add a single unit test and
it is inherited by classes that test its output to canvas, composer (PDF,
SVG), and server (and composer and server outputs against canvas), and have
any errors pop up test comparisons in a web browser. This way I can
immediately open a virtual machine for other platforms, build the tests and
*see* all of the errors in browser tabs. (about 100 times faster)

* I am not done with the test classes (need to finish composer's, at a
minimum). Hope to have it done today.

* I also found it very time-consuming to configure/maintain test web
servers on all of the test machines. So... I made not only an Python
interface to help test server output, but also recently coded an embedded
fcgi spawner and Python interface to it (fcgi-spawn and flup client). This
means a completely separate fcgi process can be spawned and queried for
unit tests (as a background process), regardless of the the machine's
installed web servers/configurations.

The embedded fcgi spawner also means that for 2.1 we can have a menu item
'Show project in test server...' which can pop up a QWebView connected to
the embedded server :^), assuming the data sources can be concurrently
accessed.

So... why did I take the long way around to try and fix this? Because the
variations are so large that without tests I had no reasonable way of
determining if my 'fix' didn't break something else.


**Essentially, at this point, I might be able to fix it by Sunday, but
having 1 more week, I know I can.**


Thanks for any update, we can help by trying your branch if needed
>

Yes, that would be greatly appreciated! I would need to know which OS's you
can test under (the more the better) and which host servers (Apache, Nginx,
etc.).

If I can get my work cleaned up today, I will let you know. I need to
finish the minimum test suite so that you can also run the tests to help
verify the fix is good to go. I will not bother to finish coding the local
embedded server's install and unattended spawning, since you can manually
spawn/kill it for the duration of the tests.

Larry

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Console API auto-completion prepared file (.pap)
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR_JZV8+vH0pPFBFUqeeKz_4XSJq8ZVtxeN_c87CuMh5Mw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've added generation of the console's API *.pap file for auto-completion
[0]. This allows to keep up with latest API bindings in an easier fashion:

make && make qsci-pap-src && make install
Generates the default .pap file (~1 MB) in source tree, which can take over
a minute.

make && make qsci-pap-master [&& make install]
Generates a local-only .pap that overrides the default .pap (when testing
new bindings). It will optionally be installed as well. Distributing such
an install, like for custom console API completions, will always override
the default .pap.

You can edit run the <src>/python/qsci_apis/generate_console_pap.py script
directly to produce custom .pap files.

Please let me know if you can think of a better solution.

Default .pap includes the following APIs (unchanged from before):

PyQGIS.api
Python-2.7.api
PyQt4-4.7.4.api
OSGeo_GDAL-OGR-1.9.1.api

Should GDAL-OGR-1.9.1 be updated to 1.10 for QGIS 2.0 release?

Larry

I think this is a good solution, I was going to push the updated APIs files
generated by myself. Thanks.

I would like update to the 1.10.0 version and add the GEOS-3.4.2, I have
prepared those api files so if there are not objections here I could push
they to master in order to add the new APIs to the pyqgis.pap file.

I am going to test your cool commit....:-)

Thanks a lot!

Sounds good to me. I'm done mucking about with the setup, so please make
the changes you see fit. Looks like the default pyqgis.pap I committed is
missing the new 'qgis.core.NULL' attribute. Must of missed that somehow.
Shows up fine when making qsci-pap-master, though. Please test for its
completion tip in console before uploading another +1 MB .pap file (thanks).

Missing is the QScintilla2 API file, but I think that will just bloat the
default completions with items most users will not need. IMO, we should
keep the default .pap as slim as possible, for the same reasons, i.e. just
core PyQGIS, OSGeo and Python/PyQt modules. That is, until there is
on-the-fly object inspection support, which would auto-filter the results.

Regards,

Larry

Larry. I would suggest you take the time you need. The QGIS server is most of the time installed from source and is therefore not too tightly coupled with the official QGIS Desktop release.

Even if it is not installed from source it is relatively easy to publish QGIS server packages independent from Desktop.

Btw: I dont see any of these font problems at my QGIS server installation. I would have noticed it since  I use QGIS server quite extensively.

That's very interesting. Larry, any idea of what we could try to che ck the reasons
of these differences?
BTW, the problem surfaced at a specific (recent) time, I think I noted it in the ticket.
All the best.

Hi Andreas,

The bug (at least the main one, noted in the issue) is not in the mapserver
code. It is definitely in QgsPalLabeling. I can fix it, but it screws up
drop shadows and some other labeling components. However, I am at a
complete loss as to why I am getting different font output resolutions
between *servers*. Again, the only way to test this is to complete a
reasonably extensive test suite, used across many platforms/setups.
Otherwise, even reports from testers will be time-consuming to go over,
without such a baseline for testing.

I really believe I can do this within the next week. Otherwise, I think it
would be asking too much of the project to 'hold off' for another week
beyond that.

Even if it is not installed from source it is relatively easy to publish

Not so on Mac, where it is included in the main app bundle. However, since
William is the main distributor for the stable version, I suppose it could
have a secondary release. My feeling is the bug should be reasonably
squashed right now.

I would love to know how that is possible. I've not seen a setup that
doesn't exhibit the issue yet. Maybe it slight enough that you just don't
'see' it on manual visual inspection. Can you possibly run the current
limited labeling server test from the build dir on that machine (or one
with access to that web server)?

It is run individually with: ctest -R PyQgsPalLabelingServer -V

It should fail due to lack of configuration, but give info on setting up
the local test server configuration file, e.g. [0]. Unfortunately, the
misconfiguration, which causes the test class to be skipped, does not
register as a FAIL at dash.orfeo-toolbox.org. Example of failed test, after
local server configuration, for my Mac nightly build setup [1].

It should also definitely fail because the current control image is from
Mac (font handling differences). Read the Python test file [2] to see other
env vars you can set to create a new set of local control images for your
platform (just don't commit them upstream to QGIS source, yet). You will
need a set of control images for canvas too, since one of the test classes
is to crosscheck server output against canvas's (the actual issue at hand),
as well the comparison of expected server output.

Hi,

It's time to get the splash ready. This thread seems to agree with the  
general direction of the drafts Nathan posted. I've therefore prepared  
three variants of the design:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/48244569 at N02/9633228465/in/photostream/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/48244569 at N02/9633228767/in/photostream/
http://www.flickr.com/photos/48244569 at N02/9633228881/in/photostream/

Please use the star feature to vote on the design(s) you prefer and leave  
comments on the image page if you think something should be changed. I'll  
check all the feedback and create the final version on Sunday evening  
(Sept 1st, CEST).

Best wishes,
Anita

the pyqgis.pap file seems not to have the PyQGIS.api file, I done some
adjustment to the cmake file [0] in order to point the generates_api script
to the right directory. Please could you verify that it is working for you
as well?

ok, we can leave out the QScintilla APIs, but what about to add the updated
file (QScintilla-2.7.2) into qsci_apis dir ? or should we drop all the old
versions (GDAL-OGR-1.10 will replace GDAL-OGR-1.9.1 and so on) ?

Hi Anita,

The options you have offer a variety of designs concerning the front 
and allow for the decision about the logo placement and "corporate 
identity".
However, I'm still not really convinced of using a background of a 
modern (admittedly visually appealing) map service which has no 
relation to and is by no means produced with the help of QGIS.
I would rather like to see an antique background map used (and I 
believe it was once the plan to use ancient maps as splash screens?). 
The Dufour map has been judged as too heavy in the previous discussion, 
and I have unfortunately not found a sample from the Sigfried map which 
could also be an option. So instead of a map, I was looking for other 
images, which are not maps, but nevertheless artistic work with spatial 
nature and cannot be mistaken (at least I believe so) to be a result of 
QGIS.

So here some pictures I found

http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monte_Rosa_and_Hotel_Schwarzsee,_Valais,_Alps_of,_Switzerland.jpg
http://www.festivaltour.de/forum/attachment.php?attachmentid=4817&d=1358685981

http://www.historisches-alpenarchiv.org/data/bilder/web/143/00109153_w.jpg

I'm not sure about the rights we have to get to use them, but they are 
ancient, so I guess that should not be a problem?

The point of the qsci-pap-src target is to update the default pyqgis.pap,
in the source tree. Once that is updated, then the regular CMakelists.txt
[0] takes care of installing it. This update could be done every once in a
while, but should always be done right before a release (i.e. like now).
The target is not part of ALL, otherwise building would take that much
longer. So, keeping a fairly recent version of pyqgis.pap updated in the
source tree is a good idea.

The qsci-pap-master target helps developers when they are testing out new
bindings and want the console to show them right away. Ideally, once a new
binding is committed, the qsci-pap-src would be run to update the default
pyqgis.pap. However, I do not expect this to happen very often; and, it
seems rather excessive to upload a new pyqgis.pap (> 1MB) so often. It
should be done a regular basis, though.

It may be possible to just remove the qsci-pap-master target. But, my
feeling is that if many developers are updating the default pyqgis.pap, it
will lead to problems with it.

In other words, your edits should not be committed. But, you did find a
bug.  :^)  Indeed, the PyQGIS.api file was not being picked up when making
qsci-pap-src. I have adjusted the custom commands and the script. GitHub is
offline right now for maintenance, but I'll commit it ASAP, along with a
fixed default pyqgis.pap.

Missing is the QScintilla2 API file, but I think that will just bloat the

I think the .api files in QGIS source/install should reflect the 'base and
most likely' versions available on supported platforms. It is common to
have a much older QScintilla installed, which is why the older 2.4.5 api is
in there. Since QGIS is working with much newer OSGeo libs (e.g. gdal-1.10)
in core, I think it would be better to have more up-to-date .api version
for those.

IMO, the idea here is to ensure new users and plugin developers don't get
used to using a newer API for something that might not be available for all
users. However, your custom API loader in console should take care of those
users who do want to use the latest.

Larry

Hi Anita,

As a general note, concerning all of the designs, I think the font used for
QGIS displays a Q with a completely different 'tail' than any Q used for
the project (it is entirely below the oval body of the Q). IMO, this, and
the font's thin character width, make the font/logo look rather weak.

Be nice to have a more assertive font, or at least a similar font with a
better Q, I think.

Regards,

Larry

Hi there, 
We seem to have some work pending for important gui translations, and our
translation manager seems out of office. 
Until when can I send pull request for french translations? tomorrow night?
(I'm not totally easy yet with git.. hope we'll make it)
Cheers, R?gis

Hi All, I agree as well with Mathias, the new swisstopo maps are 
awesome, but it looks a bit like swisstopo advertising.

I still think that Dufour map is not heavy, foremost if not on 100% 
opacity, and SiEgfridkarte (note the E mkhun, that is why you couldnt 
find anythink, too much Jass during Karto 101? ;) )

and here [1] the link with the region and the 2 map types.

also, I think the ancient images look super (foremost the hotel 
monterosa one), but an ancient map would be better.

regarding the Layout, I'm going to flickr now :)

thanks a lot
ciao

Hi Matthias,

Thank your four raising these points.

I understand your concern but I'm not sure how big an issue it would be.
In my opinion, the design is very artistic and clearly not a result which
could be achieved directly in a QGIS but which requires serious
cartographic skill.

As a reference, here is the design with the old black-and-white map
http://www.flickr.com/photos/48244569 at N02/9637382664/

Sorry, but none of those are an option in my opinion. I think they look
very dull and I would not like to look at them every day. On the technical
side, they are of very low resolution and some blurry. I would like to see
the splash screen design reflected on the new website as well, so the
material should work at different resolutions.

I'm open to try different background maps of the agreed region but they
should be available in a reasonable resolution.

Best wishes,
Anita

Sorry, time is missing for me, I must ask for some help. 

here are to commits made on i18/qgis_fr.ts in my fork:

https://github.com/haubourg/Quantum-GIS/commit/c248db7675b5c8f565b00674655c8b96d08b834f
https://github.com/haubourg/Quantum-GIS/commit/ef550f9c78c32f8b04a539c0d353b356de24e56b

I was using Jean-Roc's fork as upstream, but the fork is a week old, and
pull request is too far away now from qgis master. 

Can anyone merge only commits to these files? I must leave nom until sunday
night... 

That would be really kind of you. 
Cheers, 
R?gis (poor lonesome git learner)

ok Larry, your last commit works fine only I was wonder might be a problem
to edit the source tree file pyqgis.pap by running the qsci-pap-src target
? just curiosity!

Tonight I'll push the updated API files (GDAL/OGR-1.10.0,QScintilla-2.7.2
and GEOS-3.4.2 ) and will add the GEOS-3.4.2 APIs to the default .pap file.

Thanks for the clarification !

I saw your older post on fonts as well. Could you suggest some specific

I'm not sure I understand your question. Doing periodic updates to the
pyqgis.pap in source keeps from forcing everyone who compiles the source to
also generate that file. There is no simple means for checking when the API
has changed (except maybe SHA comparisons of the API file). Without such a
check, the generation of that file may often be unnecessary, but still done.

Everyone benefits if that file is kept up to date in the source tree. For
example, the one I replaced with the initial commit was 11 months old,
missing many completions for new functions.

Alternatively, we can set it up similar to what you were suggesting. Let me
know what you think would be a better solution.

Regards,

Larry

Personally I would prefer that we branch for release tomorrow night and not
wait another week. The reason for this is that it would be good to allow
enough time for a wide range of packages to be built from the release by
the time FOSS4G comes, and that it would be nice to have the release well
behind us by the time the upcoming hackfest starts. Also I am taking into
account Andreas' comments above. Let me know tomorrow how things are
looking and we can consider whether to extend the branching date by a few
days to accommodate you.

Ok. Thank you for the reply. I give you a report in 24 hrs. I, too, would
very much prefer not to hold things up. I know many people are waiting and
the timing is important as well.

Hi Salvatore,

Sorry to keep messing with this, but it was causing a build error. I
reverted adding of qsci-pap-master target, leaving it similar to as before,
excepting the convenience target of qsci-pap-src.

WITH_QSCIAPI is now marked as advanced, to keep casual users from thinking
they need to regenerate the .pap file as part of building.

Here is why I think this is the simplest, most versatile solution:

*Casual user/dev who compiles/installs QGIS*
Everything works as before with the default pre-prepared pyqgis.pap in
source tree used. No generation of .pap occurs. PyQGIS.api is still built
by default and the target for qsci-pap-src is just created.

*QGIS dev working on bindings*
Making qsci-pap-src will update the default .pap in source tree, which will
be used when running from build directory or install during binding
testing. If the dev is ready to commit, the already-updated .pap includes
the latest completions, and everyone benefits. We can use git to revert any
fouled-up .pap that may make its way into the repo. This assumes the
committing dev actually ran qsci-pap-src. If not, then any other dev can
easily do so, updating their source tree, then commit the new default .pap.

I am really done messing with this now. :^) If you have better solution,
please let me know.

Regards,

Larry

this I was not clear in my previous email about the update in the source
tree, but now it does make much sense.

No idea for a better solution at the moment, I agree with your solution.
For now we can go ahead keeping your last commit, just after on Sept 1st.
we can think for a better solution (whether it there is) IMO.

I was able to compile without errors and upgrade the code from the plugin I built for version 1.7 to the 1.9 dev version.? 
I am able to see it on the development version (the one compiled on my machine) but I can not figure out what I must do to install it on the OSGeo versions. In the past, I used to be able to copy the dll to the plugins folder and then it does install on its own. What should I do? I am using MSVC on windows XP .

Thank you,

Maaza

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Deprecated labels tab 'removal' pull request
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR-5WQCv-HMpjRBe9zOQ2FobO-ttJ=1onoczZ-KhbM7opw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a pull request to remove deprecated labels properties tab from
vector layer properties, if not used by an older project [0]. I've tested
it, but did not commit it because it included a public function for QgisApp
(though no Python binding). If anyone who can pass judgement upon it thinks
it is OK, please merge it, or let me know if I can.

This is the handling of the deprecated labels tab I figured was best:

* Deprecated labels tab remains active for all layers in an older project,
if any layer uses them, for the duration of project's open session
(including when saving project instance with no layers that use deprecated
labels).

* Caveat (feature?):  If all layers no longer use deprecated labels on
project close, when project is reopened, deprecated labels tab will no
longer be available. Some users may not like this, but they are being
warned about opening an older project version.

* New projects, or opened older projects that do not use deprecated labels,
will never show the deprecated labels tab. With those projects, there is no
way to enable the deprecated labeling tab.

Please let me know if I am off-the-mark with this workflow.

My logic is that if someone is still using deprecated labels in a project,
that type of labeling should remain available to all layers in the project.
I created an earlier branch where the deprecated labels tab was only turned
on for the layers that use deprecated labels [1]. However, this was fairly
limiting (see commit message) and would probably annoy users.
