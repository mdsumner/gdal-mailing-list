Hi, 

Is there a way to get the cached getCapabilities from the layer source?
If you get it you'll get the WMS version.

One thing to keep in mind is that not all the LIDAR tools are open 
sources, 2/3 of the LAStools aren't and slightly distort the output 
after certain point limits are exceeded. My opinion is that QGIS 
shouldn't ship or assist the distribution of closed binaries.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Area calculation issues
Message-ID: <fcde5950eac20a54bd84d6620d4a6c81@carto.net>

Hi, 

Regarding field calculator: 

I wonder what the difference between $area and area($geometry) is? 

They deliver different results - sometimes quite close, but sometimes
with a hug difference. 

I have to add, that the data contains circular arcs. 

Tested with 2.18.x. OTF off. 

Nyall - I remember that you dived into this issue in one of the past bug
fixing efforts? Can you explain it? I can deliver a small dataset
demonstrating the issue. 

------------------- 

Another user reported me that area calculation results are different
depending on OTF is on or off (I have to ask which QGIS version, he did
not tell). All data sets in the projects use a meter based system. The
data set of the assumedly wrong area calculations are in the same
coordinate system as the project. 

Thanks, 

Andreas

I think that's exactly what metadata() does. Perhaps I need to issue a new
getCapabilities request to the server, but fake/force an English locale? I
don't know how..

$area respects project settings like ellipsoid choice and area units.

area(geometry) is just a plain cartesian calculator.

The results will vary (sometimes by a huge amount) depending on the
geometry's crs and ellipsoid choice. Eg area($geometry) for geometries
in geographic coordinates in mostly meaningless, and the same for
projections like web mercator.

Should not affect anything.

Yes - switching off OTF will reset the ellipsoid to none. Switching it
on resets the ellipsoid choice back to the ellipsoid matching the
project CRS.

This was very confusing behaviour. The good news is that I changed
this a week or so ago in qgis 3. Now OTF has no impact on area or
length calculations, and that *only* depends on the project ellipsoid
choice.

(There was talk at the time that we should totally remove the OTF off
option. I'm in favour of this and will probably tackle it soon).

Matthias, are you sure the metadata() method translates VERSION term? 

If yes, there should be a another way to get original VERSION metadata
from GetCapabilities which is always in english.

Hi Nyall, 

Thanks for the explanations. I should have read the explanations of the
help text more closely. It explains it all. 

However, there still seem to be issues. Consider the following results
below. First column is the result of $area, second column is
area($geometry). 

Sometimes the results are very close, in other cases the difference is
massive. Like in the very first row. 32'087 vs 190'605'589 square
meters. This can't be explained with ellipsoidical vs. planimetric. In
this first row, the result of area($geometry) (planimetric) seems
correct, while the ellipsoidical result ($area) is massively wrong. 

How can this huge difference be explained? 

------------ 

Regarding the second issue - yes, it makes sense that OTF has no
influence and that always the project CRS is used. 

Thanks!

One thing you could try is to call the following method of the provider
and parse it for the version:

createRequestUrlWMS

Didn't try though

Yes I agree.
That's the way it's done in WFS (and vector data providers) but
unfortunately not (yet) in WMS (raster based providers). The proposal in
my previous email should fix that. (`QVariantMap metadata()` etc.), it
just needs someone to take care of this.

Thanks for reassuring, I always appreciate that the PSC is open about this!

Sure, everyone is free to ask the PSC for input at any time!
My point is just that I think there is still the need for a more public
discussion where everybody can bring their thoughts to the table and we
should at the moment stick to looking for input and not yet decisions.

All the best

Thanks yes I agree that sounds a reasonable approach. What do others think of my proposal to require peer review before merging PR's? I think it will help prevent situations where code gets merged before people have had a good chance to review it in future.

I don't know the tools you propose very well. Can you explain in more
detail what they will change?

In particular, does the proposal mean that the master branch is
protected from pushing and every commit is forced to be proxied over a
pull request? That would make me a bit afraid of the overhead this will
impose on the few devs which are currently checking taking care of the
PR queue.

Basically if you look at this image:

https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/178003/22511566/c9e0fb12-e89e-11e6-9d07-6ace557cb5a8.png

I propose to enable the two checkboxes:

Require pull request reviews before merging
When enabled, all commits must be made to a non-protected branch and submitted via a pull request with at least one approved review and no changes requested before it can be merged into master.

Require status checks to pass before merging
Choose which status checks <https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/statuses/> must pass before branches can be merged into master. When enabled, commits must first be pushed to another branch, then merged or pushed directly to master after status checks have passed.

The former would require that the PR is approved by someone else and the latter would require that all tests pass. They do not as far as I know prevent direct pushes to the upstream QGIS master branch (but we should probably culturally avoid that as default behavior).

	poor performance with large vector files
Message-ID: <cca7d35427444403abd0057955200919@Exch2-2.slu.se>

Hi,

Is QGIS using the geopackage spatial index? 

I have this large geopackage file with one vector layer, 16Gb 6 million polygons stored locally on my computer. When I add it to QGIS using Add Vector layer, the program becomes unresponsive for about 20 minutes until the layer appears in the Layer panel. I do this with the Render option off. When zooming in to 1:50 0000 and turning rendering on it takes about 10 minutes until the polygons start drawing on the canvas. Pan and zoom takes ages and using the Identify features tool takes 5 minutes to display the values. It's just not possible to work with the data.

The original data is in an ESRI file geodatabase. I created the geopackage file with a spatial index using ogr2ogr version 2.1.2. 

Opening the ESRI file geodatabase in QGIS works great, performance is very good.
Opening the geopackage file in ArcMap also works fine.

Mats,

The use of the spatial index requires GDAL 2.0 or later. You're still at GDAL 1.11.
Try enabling the ubuntugis repository and using the GDAL version from there, 
and install the QGIS version compatible of ubuntugis.

Hi all!

I'd like to remind you that the deadline for suggestions for the GSoC
2017 is on 5th february. (Which is only 4 days from now).

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2017-January/017061.html

For what I can find, its only Alexander Bruy that started ideas on this page:
https://hub.qgis.org/wiki/quantum-gis/Google_Summer_of_Code_2017

Did I miss something or is QGIS out of ideas? ;)

I really like to encourage you to participate and write new ideas,
which can be solved during GSoC on this page.

kind regards
Werner

Hi Renè,

I'd love to, I could talk about the python in the server, just for a change
:)

With the refactoring there are a lot of new possibilities to pythonize the
server.

Hi RenéLuc,
That would be a great opportunity to show that common move. Not sure yet
who will be there but yes, We really want to that.

Dear All,


It’s that time of the year again!


Applications for Google Summer of Code 2017 are now open for would-be
mentor organizations, and we are in the process of applying on behalf
of OSGeo. At this stage, it is extremely important that we put up a
nice and informative ideas page, that Google will look at in order to
evaluate OSGeo’s application.


*We need your help!*


As previous years, we will create an OSGeo Ideas page, that links to
software communities ideas pages. If you wish to participate, please,
start listing the ideas and the corresponding mentors of your software
community and send us the link to your wiki page latest by February
5th.


And spread the word as much as you can!!


*Please note that from this year we have set up a group email for
admin purpose where you can reach all of us OSGeo GSoC admins at once:
 gsoc-admin at osgeo.org.*


For further GSoC-related discussions e.g. inter/cross-project
ideas/proposals, ideas discussions, etc please use the long
established OSGeo’s SoC -- Google Summer of Code Coordination mailing
list (https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/soc).


Thank you

Hi all,
could please someone shortly update us on the current and near future
situation for the availability of packages for master on mayor operating
systems (deb, win, osx)? I think it would be of general interest, as it
would make it easier to solicit some early testing.
Thanks in advance.
All the best.

Is there a wiki or somewhere a list of qgis-based projects for GSoC?
I'd like to propose a QGIS-R mapping interface....

I've mentored a couple of projects in the past, would be nice to do another one.

For macOS, there is the *qgis3-dev* Homebrew formula in this repo (thanks
to everyone who helped and continues to help with that effort, including my
employer, Boundless, who funded quite a bit of my contribution):
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev

It also includes a tutorial for doing development builds as well:
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/blob/master/development/README.md

There is currently a problem with compilation against Qt 5.8.0, but I'm
working on it.

For general testing by Homebrew users, automating the binary output of the
built formula would allow them to install from pre-built packages, instead
of building from source. This would require Travis build times to be
extended for that repo or some small Homebrew setup inside of QGIS source
tree.

It would be good to continue work on extending that Homebrew install
process with an optional full bundling of a QGIS.app (optionally with major
Processing deps included). Then, an easy to use standalone QGIS3.app beta
for macOS can be generated.

If full bundling was produced, then the QGIS project could offer its own
macOS releases, code-signed with the OSGeo certificates. It was mentioned
that such a revamping of the macOS bundling routines might be a reasonable
grant proposal to the project.

Personally I would love to see a signed, bundled QGIS.app for MacOS. I 
know it is going to be huge, but I think it will really make the 
experience on MacOS a lot closer to that which Windows and Linux users 
get. I also wanted to thank you (and Boundless) for the hard work you 
have put in on getting the brew formulas built - it is really great to 
be able to build QGIS master on Mac now!

Tim

even AFTER (!) I’ve loaded a project, I’m hitting these darned full table scans with this darned query:
"SELECT st_extent("the_geom") FROM "geo_search"."block_view" WHERE ("property_type" = 'SFD')"
when the connect string in the project file clearly states:
 <datasource>dbname='geo' host=blah.blah.amazonaws.com port=5432 user=‘joeschmo' password=‘like_im_going_to_tell_you?' sslmode=disable key='id' estimatedmetadata=true srid=4269 type=MultiPolygon table="geo_search"."block_view" (the_geom) sql= </datasource>
maybe I’m doing something wrong; I hope so. If not, folks: Users need to connect to well-authored QGIS project, files backed by a large number (millions, or hundreds of millions) of rows in SECONDS, not tens (or even hundreds) of MINUTES, and not step on unknown/unnecessary "land-mines" just turning layers on and off that make the app useless, if QGIS is to be relevant for this increasingly common class of problem.
looking for a contractor to do some brain surgery to:
QgsPostgresProvider::uniqueData() and QgsRectangle QgsPostgresProvider::extent()
in: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresprovider.cpp <https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/src/providers/postgres/qgspostgresprovider.cpp>

thanks!
Chris

revisiting this problem; it is really making QGIS totally unusable for the large tables we are manipulating.

UNECESSARY FULL TABLE SCANS == VERY BAD USER EXPERIENCE!!

If funds could be made available for this fix, is there anyone able/available to add this functionality, and avoid a full table scan on adding a layer, and on existing project start-up?

(i.e. add a new pop-up dialog when one adds a new vector layer to optionally/manually enter the layer extents)

this would make QGIS *-far-* more usable for “big data”

thanks!
Chris

Not sure who suggested the notion that LAStools binaries will be shipped
with QGIS or that there maybe will be an auto-download of sorts ... there
will not. The LAStools package can be used as a toolbox in ArcGIS, IMAGINE,
FME, and QGIS or as a stand alone software. I see more and more LiDAR
practitioners (those that I am teaching) doing their GIS with the Q instead
of Argh and the QGIS toolboxes the most up-to-date toolboxes. If a user
wants to use LAStools (whether via QGIS or not) the tools will only be
available via my site and not be bundled.

Regards from the Philippines,

Martin

Totally agree - this sounds like a perfect grant proposal to me!

I'm in favour - in theory this sounds like a good, safe move. I would
say we trial it out for a period and see how it works in practice.

That might be my fault. I mentioned that, by having the LiDAR tools
provider as a separate plugin, that allows to ship the tools with it
(not with QGIS, but with the plugin itself, which you will manage and
release whenever you want). Of course, you can still provide the
downloads from your site as usual, this would just be a more practical
solution, to avoid having to setup the LASTools path in Processing

Cheers

Thanks a lot Larry. I agree, having a simpler way of installing QGIS on
OSX is a worthwhile goal.
So, in short, Q3 installer is not yet available on any platform, right?
All the best.

 RuntimeError: Could not load layer: memory:
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FhTradxRWvJ=sUCY9AH5Li-=uJvpin+ReKN6HD+yux=kQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm testing the "Create script collection plugin" functionality in QGIS
2.18.3.

The plugin seems to be created fine and the scripts show up in the QGIS
section of the toolbox. (Took me a while to find them there.)

But when running any of the scripts, I get: RuntimeError: Could not load
layer: memory:

If I specify an output file instead of "Create temporary layer", the script
runs fine and the output is created correctly.

If I run the script stand-alone (without integrating it into a plugin),
temporary output works fine.

Is this a known issue? Or should I file a ticket?

Best wishes,
Anita

Looks like, in that case, Processing is not correctly resolving the
layer source. A bit weird that it does it only under those
conditions...

I will take a look at it now, but please, open a ticket, in case it is
not an easy fix and needs more work

Thanks!

Hello, in fact, I have a problem with the software QGIS 2.6.0. Here I
need to insert a new point in a vector layer from its coordinates. On
the other hand in the manual, we are only offered the possibility of
inserting a point from the mouse.I would like to know if there is a
possibility to insert a point from its coordinates.
Thank you

Dear all

we have now managed to set up a concrete offer for this feature and are now
looking for funding. The costs are 4000€ and we have gathered 2000-2500€ so
far.

Is there anyone on this list who also craves for this feature and would
like to financially support it? I can provide any additional info offline.

Also, given the relatively low costs, I'd prefer to avoid a full-fledge
crowdsourcing campaign. Too much overhead.

Thanks a lot and all the best

Stéphane

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Application jmp_buf size changed
Message-ID: <CAHCHdbKyPFTAA3LqEK7zDtiiDeEKrD+xWsRWyYHzsBxZd4bcnQ@mail.gmail.com>

Yesterday I built the latest 2.18 code on a Virtualbox with Ubuntu GNOME
guest. Compilation went fine but when I try to run QGIS it fails
immediately with the following error:

libpng warning: Application jmp_buf size changed
> Segmentation fault (core dumped)


Can someone give me ideas for how to resolve this? Some Googling around
leads me to believe it may be related to GRASS in some way. I installed
7.2.0 and 6.4.6 from source without any problems before compiling QGIS.

Thanks,
Spencer

Ok - I've looked into this. It's not an issue in 2.14 or 3.0, just 2.18.

It was most likely fixed by:
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/abc0919 "Fix area calculation of
compoundcurve rings if they contain a 2-vertex linestring"

Committed to 2.14 (with unit tests), I forward ported to 3.0, but it
hasn't been applied to 2.18. I'll do this.

Dear Nyall, 

Thank you so much for analyzing the issue and also thank you in advance
for porting the fix to 2.18! 

I opened the sample project with 2.14 and I can confirm that the area
values of both planimetric and ellipsoidic area calculations are very
close for all features. 

It is very much appreciated! 

Thanks, 

Andreas

whi not:
1) compile with Debug to have more execution detail
2) run under a debugger as gdb and be informed where exactly the core happen

I get the following error during the configure stage in CMake:


CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:248 (FIND_PACKAGE):
   By not providing "FindQt5Gui.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by 
"Qt5Gui", but
   CMake did not find one.

   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "Qt5Gui" with any
   of the following names:

     Qt5GuiConfig.cmake
     qt5gui-config.cmake

   Add the installation prefix of "Qt5Gui" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
   "Qt5Gui_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If 
"Qt5Gui"
   provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
   installed.


QT5 is not mentioned in the docs as a prerequisite, am I meant to get it 
from www.qt.io (installer wants me to create an account) or is it meant 
to come from somewhere else?

Hi,

I am trying to compile master and it fails with 'no member named
AppDataLocation in QStandardPaths', which was added in Qt 5.4.

INSTALL says in requirements Qt >= 5.3.0, Debian stable has 5.3.2.

So what is now minimum required Qt version?

Any particular version of QT? It turns out it can't be higher than QT 
5.5 because QTWebKit was removed in later versions. But QTScript is not 
present in 5.5. Now I'm trying 5.3 but I get:

CMake Error at cmake/FindQCA.cmake:59 (message):
Could not find QCA
Call Stack (most recent call first):
CMakeLists.txt:292 (FIND_PACKAGE)

Went back to OSGeo4W setup, installed QCA-libs and QCA-devel - no 
difference.

Hi Andrew,

Compiling with Qt 5 (and therefore compiling master) on Windows is still
very experimental. The libraries are not yet available on osgeo4w and
I'm not sure if they are available elsewhere (QCA, QWT, QtWebKit,
PyQt5-Python3 etc.).

Depending on what you need, compile the release-2_18 branch with the
dependencies on osgeo4w, wait a little longer until the dependencies
become available (or use linux or mac or if you really want you can also
try to compile all the dependencies yourself as well).

Done now. I also added one of those polygons to the reference geometry
test to ensure that all other stats (perimeter, centroid, etc) match
PostGIS' results.

I've always wondered why the read-only driver was chosen to be included with the packaged app over the other. Both "open" the fGDB format. The file geodatabase is enough of a ubiquitous exchange format now that it makes sense to me to just include the write option by default instead of having to go install it with each upgrade. I'm also glad that Esri now includes some functionality with the SpatiaLite/Geopackage formats, although, IMHO, it still misses the mark and is lacking in functionality on several levels. The ability to write to a fGDB is definitely a nice option to have.

FileGDB is a proprietary and closed data format (regardless of whether the
*use* of its compiled API is open-licensed). While it is ubiquitous in some
commercial software workflows, the data is locked into the vendor's format,
which is not even publicly described. This helps no one but the vendor.

In order for OGR's default, read-only OpenFileGDB driver to be created,
Even Rouault had to figure out the format by way of a huge amount of effort
(also note: his spec notes are freely available and open-licensed):
https://github.com/rouault/dump_gdbtable/wiki/FGDB-Spec

The source code for the driver is also open-source:
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/tree/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/openfilegdb

Without Even's work there would be no read-only driver, let alone one that
anyone else can improve upon.

Packaging GDAL/OGR, or QGIS, by default with the FileGDB driver and the
FileGDB API libs is now possible (or at least appears to be, due to the API
libs' new Apache 2.0 license). However, the onus to provide support for
vendor proprietary formats should not necessarily be on the open-source
projects. Even providing read-only drivers is not within their purview
(though they often do that). If a user wishes to use these formats and the
projects have volunteered development to support them, the user needs only
enable (like by choosing the option to install it in OSGeo4W) or compile
that support. This is an entirely appropriate expectation of users by
open-source project contributors and open data format supporters.

I'm also glad that Esri now includes some functionality with the

While it is definitely good to see such support, commercial GIS software
vendors have no real need to fully support non-vendor formats. Indeed, it
may go against their business model, which, by definition of using vendor
formats, is not in anyone else's interest. Supporting open data formats to
a limited extent allows such vendors to *say* they support such formats.

The solution is to move away from vendor proprietary formats and use open
data formats and open source software to read/write them. Everyone wins in
this scenario, except those looking to make money off of other's
vendor-locked data misfortunes.

I realize moving away from proprietary formats is not possible for many
users, who may be stuck using them due to constraints out of their control.
Petitioning to have those vendor formats accessible via at least an open
protocol is something users can attempt, to alleviate the situation.

Pretty sure I've said this before - but this is fantastic to see. It's
so great to see such a transparent and community driven structure
behind the project.

Many (MANY!) thanks for the PSC and everyone else involved in getting
this organisation structure set up.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Processing algs & plugins... should we actively
	pull into master?
Message-ID: <CAB28Asj5L-kyoV-1KGzH0xbgdFw6fojHn0LbSrVbp8NWOXa_yA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wanted to raise a question I've been pondering lately.

Thanks to the success of the processing plugin, we're now seeing a lot
of 3rd party plugins which implement their functionality as processing
providers. (This is a great thing and hopefully we see more of this
when people port their plugins to 3.0!)

A lot of these provide useful functionality with quite small and
self-contained code. Here's a good example:
https://github.com/Septima/qgis-wedgebuffer
When you strip this plugin back it's basically 3/4 small functions
wrapped in a processing algorithm.

What I'm wondering now is whether we should be merging functionality
like this into master. In many ways the success of processing depends
entirely upon the amount (and quality!) of available algorithms. By
pulling the guts of these plugin based algorithms into master we allow
them to be used by all qgis users without the need to install extra
plugins.

The way I see it is:

Advantages:
- functionality available immediately from the default install
- by its nature processing algorithm code is very self-contained -
usually just a single file. We're not bloating the api by including
this functionality.
- processing has a strong framework for tests, so assuming suitable
tests are added when an algorithm is merged there's little extra
burden of maintenance here
- having this code in front of core developer's eyes likely leads to
improvements (in api & performance) for core c++ code. Speaking for
myself, I've pushed many fixes to the geometry engine as a direct
result of seeing how it's being used in processing algorithms.

Possible advantages:
- might be a good spring-board for easing plugin developers into
working with the master repo. There's a chance they'll find confidence
in this to make changes elsewhere in the code.

Disadvantages:
- more code in repo to maintain
- responsibility for fixes/improvements moves from plugin devs to qgis core devs
- plugin devs would need to go through PR process to implement
fixes/changes, and need to wait for next QGIS release for the changes
to be distributed

Possible disadvantages:
- we risk "stepping on plugin developer's toes". It's possible a
plugin developer might not like seeing the role their plugin once
played "taken over" by master. (On the other hand, they may be proud
to see their work accepted into the default install!)

So what do we think? Good move? Bad move?

Nyall

this is a possibility; in my experience however it can be avoided by
proper communication with plugin authors. for what I have seen, plugin
authors are pleased by the interest we have in their work, so I think
we'll encounter no major problems here. I can keep on taking the
responsibility of communicating to plugin authors if nobody wants to
step in.

good by all means.
All the best.

Very interesting question...

IMHO, all plugins that include processing algorithms like that (just
one of them or a few of them, using only native code), we should ask
developers to put the code in the central QGIS repo, and then work on
that through PRs. It makes more sense. In the case of a plugin that
adds a large group of algorithms and has some "identity", or uses an
external app, I think it makes sense to have it as a separate plugin.

I think most developers will agree on that and will accept it. If
someone doesnt....well, then we have that code as a separate plugin,
not that bad, but with those that accept, we will enlarge the core
Processing collection and make it better.

Just let make sure that we have some clear acceptance criteria (algs
with tests, trying to follow some "best practices" and using
Processing methods when possible, etc).

I will be happy to help on that, even helping devs in this migration
from separate plugin to core Processing, in case there is a need to
convert code somehow

Cheers

right, what could be the procedure then? whan I see a submitted pluygin
that qualifies for this should I warn you (and Nyall) for analysis
before suggesting it to the dev?
All the best.

Or even just a discrete group in the Processing toolbox?

I know there is a bit of philosophical thinking to be done as to whether we want to be a 'slim core' project or a 'batteries included' project. I generally prefer the batteries included approach if we can make features discoverable and consistent with the rest of the QGIS experience. So +1 from me to build out processing into a much richer store of tools.  One more argument for including new algs in processing in QGIS Master rather than as plugins - if we want plugin authors to utilize processing more, it is much more convenient that the algs are all there 'out of the box' compared to expecting plugin users to install other plugins in order to first satisfy processing dependencies.

One thing I am concerned about is that we guarantee some stability in the behavior of processing. While it is true that strictly speaking new algorithms do not represent API extensions / additions, in some level I think they do since anyone using Python + Processing will be vulnerable to future behavioral changes / deletions from the set of tools shipped with processing. If we want to get plugin writers to rely on Processing rather than implementing geoprocessing etc.  functionality themselves, they need to know that a) the algorithms they need will be installed on their user's computers and b) that those algorithms will behave in a consistent way across the major release life cycle of QGIS.

Tim

Ah yes - I forgot to include that in my email, even though that was my
intent. Definitely plugins with external deps (or even large amounts
of private classes) should remain as plugins.

Big +1. We'd still need to careful vet and review the code for quality.

I think we can have good control over that. Once the code is in the QGIS
repo and authors work on it there via PRs, we shouldnt allow them to modify
algorithm semantics or do any 'crazy' change. We have control over that. So
actually it is better to have it in core for that kind of integration,
since we, as QGIS project , will likely be more strict than a developer
working on his own repo, and take all this into account.

qgis 3 dev can now be easily installed (and tested?) on Windows.
Wonderful!

While it is true that strictly speaking new algorithms do not represent API extensions / additions, in some level I think they do since anyone using Python + Processing will be vulnerable to future behavioral changes / deletions from the set of tools shipped with processing. If we want to get plugin writers to rely on Processing rather than implementing geoprocessing etc.  functionality themselves, they need to know that a) the algorithms they need will be installed on their user's computers and b) that those algorithms will behave in a consistent way across the major release life cycle of QGIS.

We have control over that. So actually it is better to have it in core for that kind of integration, since we, as QGIS project , will likely be more strict than a developer working on his own repo, and take all this into account.

Yeah that makes sense .... 

Thanks

Hi,

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'osgeo'


which prevents the Processing use (make it invalid).

Can this be a local problem?

Thanks!

Oh sorry Jurgen, these were so great news, that I forgot to check hub
(#16151 and #16152)... Sorry...

I also get this warning:

Layer is not valid: The layer C:\bin\qgis-dev-bin.exe is not a valid layer
and can not be added to the map

Is this a related problem?

Thanks!
Pedro

Yes.  Also related to the grass daily build publishing the other packages too

That is wonderful news for the Windows version.

In case I missed something, my understanding is that qgis-dev (2.99) 
builds and works on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit, running Qt 5.5, Grass 7, Python 
3.5, etc..  But doesn't build on Ubuntu 16.10 which uses Qt 5.6.  And 
most certainly doesn't build with Qt 5.8 or 5.7 even without Qt Webkit 
and WebkitWidgets.  The Qt Webkit and Q WebkitWidgets are available for 
Ubuntu but one of the requirements is an upgrade of "icu" to 
"icu4c-58_2".  Has anyone installed all that and tried it?  Knows what 
changes are required?  Possibly the build requires a lower version of 
g++ from 6.3 but I tried g++-5 and that made no difference and making 
too many changes to Qt header files seemed risky.

That's not the case - I regularly build on both Ubuntu 16.10 and
Fedora 25 (qt 5.7.1). On both platforms Qt Webkit is working
correctly.

Are you using Qt from the distro's repos or the binaries provided by
the Qt project?

That's a mistake. AFAIK we are targeting 5.3 to cater for Debian.
Looks like the use of AppDataLocation will need to be ifdefed out and
replaced with some suitable location for Qt < 5.4 or else that feature
(loading user startup scripts) will need to be disabled for Qt 5.3.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Outline/border -> stroke?
Message-ID: <CAB28Ashcn_gwRuw+Kjnpq2SfPTTPY4Da+S9KXZQ6zpvJKwi7Dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Following up on one of the points raised by John Hawkison (author of
the famous "my first weekend with QGIS" email), I'd like to raise
discussion about renaming all use of outline/border throughout QGIS to
"stroke".

I've been thinking about this and I'm personally in favour.

Why?
- the terms border, outline and pen are used inconsistently throughout
QGIS. Eg a polygon fill has an outline, a simple line has a pen.
- the API is even worse... these terms are thrown around with no
logical pattern. Even within single classes we mix and match
- stroke is a good replacement for all these terms. It's also commonly
used by most design software instead of border or outline.

Any opinions here? Any objections if I made this change?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,
thanks for this - cleanup and consistency are much overdue. To me, as a
non EN speaker, outline is more understandable than stroke, but of
course you win, and any choice is better than inconsistency.
BTW, I also question the historical choice of having outline by default
for polygons: they do not look nice with it (plain full colour polygons
look better to me) and apparently it is also slowing down a bit the
rendering. So I would propose the default rendering for polygons to be
without an outline (stroke ;) ).
Objections?
All the best.

I'm -1 on removing polygon outline by default. In many datasets (think
administrative boundaries, cadastral polygons, etc.), polygons share
boundaries and the outline is important.

On the other hand, I'm not against improving things by default :) IMHO, we
could greatly improve default coloring by avoiding a rgb(0,0,0) outline and
instead use a darkened fill color as the outline. Err, stroke ... ;)

I agree, and tried to do this change a while ago. Unfortunately it's
not easy (possible?). Here's an example why:

If we change default outline/stroke/border to be slightly darker
version of polygon color it works nicely for single symbol renderers.
But the same changes apply also to graduated/categorised renderers.
And this means that all the classes created with the default ramp have
their outline colors set to darker versions of the class color. If you
then go and change the ramp, all the fill colors update to reflect but
not the outline color. There's no way to differentiate the slightly
darker outline color set by default from a user-set slightly darker
outline color. So we can't wipe them out and replace them all, but
this means that the outline color will be a different hue to the new
class fill color. Really ugly, and a step back from just having a
'neutral' black color...

Hey Larry,
Thanks for your reply. It's sometimes tough to mention Esri on this list without hackles getting raised, but it's out there. It's a fact. People use it. Some HAVE to use it. I'm in that crowd. It would be wrong on your part to assume that because I use it, I am unappreciative of the work that goes on for open source development. I also use QGIS in my workflows, and many kudos to all the devs that have created a really great open source product that has received international attention and in some places replaced COTS software. 

This was more of a "suggestion box" item than creating a stage for commercial vs. open source. And I deeply appreciate the work Mr. Rouault put into accessing the format. It makes my job infinitely easier... 

You grabbed the pulpit, and that's fine, but I wouldn't be on this list if I weren't a fan, so back to the target item, and let's keep this simple: 
1. It has already been written. 
2. There are two things that do the same task, but one does an additional task (value-added). 
3. Many things that have already been written have been incorporated into the core.
4. OpenFileGDB is incorporated by default in the core now. 
5. My question was simple and innocent without prejudice: Why choose one over the other to package in the core?

Thanks,

Sent from my iPhone

However, the onus to provide support for vendor proprietary formats should not necessarily be on the open-source projects. Even providing read-only drivers is not within their purview (though they often do that). If a user wishes to use these formats and the projects have volunteered development to support them, the user needs only enable (like by choosing the option to install it in OSGeo4W) or compile that support. This is an entirely appropriate expectation of users by open-source project contributors and open data format supporters.

There are nightlies of master for yakkety (16.10) which build fine (see

As a non-Dev (only a user) and a non native English speaker:

   - Yes to consistency!
   - "Stroke" is also less clear to me than "Border" or "Outline". I would
   prefer one of those 2 but I will not object if english-speakers think that
   "stroke" is more correct
   - Yes to keep the stroke / border / outline of the polygons by default
   (same reason as Mathieu)
   - Default color for the polygons: what about (as a compromise) having by
   default a dark grey instead of 0 / 0 / 0? I believe this looks nicer than
   plain black in most cases

Cheers

Stéphane

Debian jessie (stable) has GDAL 1.10.1 - too old for us.
Debian stretch (testing) has Qt 5.7.1.

Hi, 

+1 for renaming to "stroke". "stroke" is also used as the term in SVG /
PDF specifications - the two most important vector graphic standards. 

As a consequence, we would have related terms, such as "stroke-width",
"stroke-linecap", "stroke-dasharray", etc. See
https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/REC-SVG11-20110816/painting.html#StrokeProperties
 

Another candidate would be renaming everything "transparency" with
"opacity" - but I guess it would be more controversial ;-) And it would
mean that sliders would have to be reversed, as 100% opacity = 0%
transparency.

I think most users will find transparency more understandable than
opacity. What is bad is that I think we are still mixing the two.

All the best.

Ah - I didn't realise. So what's the minimum target now? 5.5 to match Xenial?

Very much agree that consistent sliders for this is desirable (whether
it's opacity or transparency).

The issue here is that we potentially break existing projects. While
updating the ui & api can be done, how can we handle user's data
defined opacity/transparency rules?

Aren't we breaking projects for q3 anyway?

Well, ideally not. Currently we only break projects which rely on very
old features (such as 1.x labeling, conversion from old symbology,
some composer features from maybe 2.6 or earlier). None of these
breaks are ever likely to be encountered by users.

But breaking data defined transparency may.

IMHO the break is not desirable, but acceptable, if the advantage is
more consistency.
I think we can prepare a short Migration guide pointing out all the
points to be taken care of/check/modify for the end user.

As a user and not developer (again...), I could also live with my projects
being slightly broken (+1 for the short migration guide) if this is the
price to pay for a perfect consistency of the transparency / opacity
sliders.

In this case I would also favor "transparency" over "opacity"

And I surrender to Andreas's argument. Yes to "stroke" (instead of "border"
or "outline") if this means we are following well accepted standards

Cheers

I'm not sure we need to break the project here though right?  The xml can
stay the same just the API and UI is different.

Definitely "stroke", both because it is the standard term in graphics
software, and also because neither "border" nor "outline" make any sense in
a line.

I agree that a dark grey would be a better choice of default stroke than
black:

Subject: [Qgis-developer] XYZ layers are not a type of WMS
Message-ID: <1486464848414-5306710.post@n6.nabble.com>

I don't know what others think, but I think incorporating the new XYZ tile
layers support in the GUI by using WMS as a "parent" layer type is
incorrect:

1. they are a different kind of layer (and I presume not an OGC standard)
2. it hides the support for XYZ layers in QGIS from the user

What do others think? Either they should be moved out from "under" WMS, or
WMS needs to be renamed to something more generic.

Certainly the API shouldn't detect an XYZ layer as a WMS.

Thanks

Tom

I do compile all geo packages (gdal,proj,grass) myself but I would
like to avoid Qt compilation.
What others do on jessie? Do you compile Qt?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] 3.0 Documentation and branching
Message-ID: <CA+H0G_G81pR03+4sd+XnEgfstyVbCy_2fSKzAGGbwOg5gcEQUA@mail.gmail.com>

In my opinion, we need to take action to make sure that a developer that is
working on a master version feature is not prevented from documenting it
because the documentation team is still working on the 2.16 version issues.
Example:

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/commit/4e155346641d17a532755f535ff363b355327c91

Documentation needs all the help it can get. If we expect core developer to
help with documentation, the only time this is remotely possible is when
they are making changes to QGIS master. For that reason, QGIS Documentation
and QGIS master branches must be in sync regarding the version.

Some time ago, we decided that we are going to release documentation for
LTR releases. That was for us to concentrate efforts for documenting those
special releases and, as soon it's finished, branch the repo. If we keep
trying to complete version 2.x documentation, before we even start working
on the 3.X version, we can end up wasting efforts in documenting things
that have already changed in master.

So, IMHO, after the release and branch a QGIS LTR version, we can delay the
documentation branching for a while to give time for a good documentation
release, but we can't do it for too long, to avoid the situation mentioned
above.

Also, IMHO, after documentation LTR branching (e.g. 2.14), documenting any
feature introduced in an intermediate version (e.g. 2.16, 2.18) should be
done, if possible, taking into account changes make to it in QGIS master
(e.g. 2.99).

Cheers,

Alexandre Neto

Anyone know how to fix this issue?  I used Python3.

Not sure on this one - did you clean your build folder after resolving
the dependency issues?

Hi again,

And thanks Alexandre for the alternative solution. Your workflow is quite flexible and powerful too, and seems to be a bit more simple.
Yet, I still assume (from the experience within my organization) that it is still a bit too complex for people who use QGIS (or GIS in general) rather seldom.

Thus I packed the Python script I compiled into a plugin (“SerialPrint”) for simplistic serial map production.

If one has a composer with a map item (and optionally a legend), the plugin will loop over a list of user defined layers and:

1         toogle the current layer visible,

2         insert an entry at the top of the legend,

3         export the composition to raster or PDF,

4         toogle the current layer invisible again, remove the respective legend entry and go to next layer in the list…

The plugin needs some cosmetics and would benefit from some enhancements I already have in mind, but it should be working OK.
It is available at: https://github.com/NINAnor/SerialPrint In addition, I also just uploaded it to the plugin repository (flagged as experimental), so testing becomes more easy.

I would be happy about tests and feedback!

Kind regards,
Stefan

Subject: Re: [Qgis-user] Print one map for every category in layer with fixed extent

So,

Imagining that you have layer as a regular grid. Each cell has, for different species, the number of individuals found stored in columns. You want to keep the map always with the same extent and iterate over the columns (species).
With atlas, all you need is a layer with a list of the names of all the columns you want to iterate. It does not have to be spatial, you can just create it as a simple CSV and import that in QGIS. You can also add it other columns with information that you want to use in the maps. Here an example:
"column_name", "common_name", "scientific_name" <-- first row can be used for column names
"specie_1", "specie 1 common name", "specie 1 scientific name"
"specie_2", "specie 2 common name", "specie 2 scientific name"
"specie_3", "specie 3 common name", "specie 3 scientific name"
After loading the layer and give it a name ("list_of_species" for this example) Use that layer atlas layer.

Let's say we want to draw the cell with some color if there are more that 0 elements of a particular specie and white for the rest. In a rule-base simbology, you would need something like:
"specie_1" > 0      --> color
ELSE          --> white

Since we what to iterate the column name, we can get it from the atlas feature, and we can recreate a string that match the expression above. But we need to pass it trough the eval() function to make it work

eval('"' + attribute( @atlas_feature, 'column_name') + '" > 0')
Something similar can also be used directly in a graduated style, without the ">0" part:

eval('"' + attribute( @atlas_feature, 'column_name') + '"')
I have planned to do a blog post about this, but it's in my long to do list.

Hope it helps.
Alexandre Neto

Hi Alexandre,

Currently I have a layer per species, but species could also be in one layer with names of the different species in the attribute table…

I already compiled a little Python script for my use case, however, if there is an existing function for that is better of course…

Thanks for helping.

Kind regards,
Stefan

In the layer, where is the species recorded? In Columns?

If so, I have a workflow for that.

Thanks Andreas for the excellent procedure description.

Good to know that Python is not required for that, and that there is a nice, flexible, and efficient solution!

For someone who uses QGIS on a regularly basis, this is actually much less work than it might seem at a first look.
However, I am afraid, if I imagine that I try to explain that to my colleagues, many would not be able or not willing to follow, I am afraid…

I found some more code snippets online, which I compiled into a small script. That could be easily wrapped into a plugin if none exists for that yet…??

Hi Stefan,

It is possible without the help of Python.

You would have to split up the species into layers.

Then create an atlas layer that is the geometry you want joined with every possible layer. You can use QGIS virtual layers for that which you can define in DB manager. Or use a Postgis view for it.

So for each geographic unit you want to print you need a combination with each layer you want.

E.g.

Province 1 - Species 1

Province 1 - Species 2

Province 1 - Species 3

Province 2 - Species 1

Province 2 - Species 2

Province 2 - Species 3

In this layer, the geometry is redundant, but since you can use Postgis views or virtual layers, it is only virtually redundant.

-------------

Finally, in print composer you would use data-defined layers or visibility presets based on attributes in the atlas coverage layers.

I did exactly that - print an Atlas for several districts in my city and a loop of historic maps. For each district I printed around 15 different historic time snapshots (old maps).

Hope this helps to get started.

Andreas

Dear all,

In a project I like to produce a sort of species distribution atlas, where I like to print out (export to image) a map from the print composer for every species recorded within one and the same municipality.

So, the map extent should not change and layout is fixed too. With these things fixed, I want to get a map for each single species mapped and thus also legend entries change. The species are in one single layer, but I could also split them if that makes it easier.

Is there a function in Atlas for that which I overlooked or a plugin or the like.
If not, is there any Python code I could repurpose for that? Found only this [1] and [2], where [1] does not work…

But before I start looking into a pygqis solution I like to make sure that this feature does not exist yet…
This is a not uncommon use case in ecology btw., so a built in function would be neat.

I am grateful for any hint.

Kind regards,
Stefan

I guess we all agree that the documentation needs help from everyone. And
none of us, I think, hesitate to remind this need and invite people to
contribute whenever possible. I also agree that core developers are somehow
the best interlocutors to help documenting features they develop so, when
they are available to help, they are more than welcome.

BUT I'm sorry, IMHO you took the wrong example (if ever there's one) to
show that someone is not welcome.

Nowhere in the discussion you pointed I can see a barrier to any
contribution from core dev. What was asked is to do like most of us: make a
pull request that can be reviewed and discussed by interested people. This
way, we avoid breaking silently documentation build (not only the
application repo is concerned, you know that - it has already occured) and
ensure a contribution free of typo or mistake. I'm sure there's no need to
replay a recent discussion on psc-list about contributing "large chunks" of
code without any review. I mistakenly(?) thought (and was proud) that the
option taken to proceed through PRs submission (for not obvious fixes) to
QGIS repo was already in the DNA of QGIS-DOC contributors.

This was on the form, and on the substance I have some concerns about the
commit itself: eg, do we need to remove any mention of Taudem, including
instructions on configuring its provider when linked to QGIS?
Btw here's a perfect example of a core dev contribution through pull
request, few days before the aboce mentioned commit and, covering the *same
issue*: https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Documentation/pull/1670 This pull
request was being discussed. Honestly, we can't be discussing an issue, a
way to fix things and have a related commit pushed in our back, ignoring
that discussion.
In brief, there are enough things to discuss and it's worth a pull request
imo.

Any other kind of action you were thinking of to help *any contributor*
follow doc guidelines and make a great contribution?

Some time ago, we decided that we are going to release documentation for

reluctance" on LTR-only releases (given that the next LTR is not 3.0 but
3.2 and is far away) so unless there's a real move from the team to push a
bunch of fixes to QGIS 3.0 issues, i opted to keep documenting 2.x features
(and not only 2.16) I could work on.
A recent proposal to workaround this "issue" was exposed in (another long)
message I sent few weeks ago (with few feedbacks) in the psc-list:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2017-January/005047.html

Personally I see no sense in passing ALL edits via pull-request mechanism.
While this makes sense for huge edits which add a lot of new text, creating
a PR for small edits or removals of obsolete part of documentation looks like
overhead for me.

As I already said, I see no sense in keeping instructions for 3rd party/external
tools in the QGIS User Guide. Those should be part of the that 3rd party tool
manual.

Thanks Luigi for spotting it! Good to progressively clean up problems in
old plugins.
All the best.

Hello Harrissou et al.,

Sorry if I sounded too harsh. That was not my intention, at all. Neither
was my intention to point my finger to you. Intead I wanted to point to a
situation that this commit exposed. Also, I don't think no one got offended
by the comments to the commit or that it looked like people are not welcome.

I totally agree with the PR methodology. So I totally agree on your
comments on that.

My concerns are about this part:



*"Then, afaict, a part of this commit is more about QGIS 3 changes and I am
not sure we are currently documenting QGIS3 stuffs (still waiting for
comments and decision in this thread
<https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/qgis-psc/2017-January/005060.html>)."*
So, with my email, I just wanted to go back to the discussion of what
versions we are planning/want to release and have a decision. Also, make
sure that whatever the decision on that, we have a solution that does not
put a developer's (or anyone else) PR on hold (not merged) if they want to
contribute documentation for the current is master version. Mainly because
people's availability and motivation can be affected by that.

Kind Regard,

Alexandre Neto

I thought that https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Processing was intended for
these kinds of algorithms. It's centralized, but not core, intended for
pure methods instead of plugins.

Perhaps the confusion is that the Plugins and the Processing add-ons
have 2 different installers, and it's not obvious that both exist?

This seems like the start down the path, where after addition of tests
and code review it might then go to core.

Thanks,
Alex

Message-ID: <1486577706236-5307006.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Soory for another "how do I get this via the API" question. How do I get an
XYZ layer's transparency in Python ("Global transparency" in layer
properties/style pane)? How about for WMS and local raster layers?

Thanks

Tom

This is what I discovered.

On Ubuntu 16.10 the following packages: `pyqt5-dev pyqt5-dev-tools 
pyqt5.qsci-dev` seem to be the Qt 5.7 version.
I removed them and reinstalled to confirm.  Then I deleted the build 
folder and started over.

The build stops at 95% and doing a further `make qgis -j3` completes the 
build (I have 4 processor slots but others seem suggest doing 4-1 (don't 
know why), and running `./output/bin/qgis` from the build directory 
works.
I get a Python Error screen which says:

`Couldn't load PyQt.
Python support will be disabled.


Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "", line 1, in
ImportError: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libQt5Core.so.5: version `Qt_5.7' 
not found (required by 
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/PyQt5/QtCore.so)`

I don't think this problem is specific to me but would affect any Ubuntu 
16.10 64-bit system.  I could be wrong and would appreciate any help 
offered.

Does anyone know how to install version 5.6.1 of `pyqt5-dev 
pyqt5-dev-tools pyqt5.qsci-dev`?  Or alternately does anyone know how to 
install the debian package for Qt 5.7, which hopefully has the modified 
C++ header files and WebKit as the Qt Maintenace tool doesn't provide a 
localized version with the appropriate C++ header files?

Hi Alexandre,

the main reason holding back 3.0 descriptions from master is to be able
to release a (nowadays pretty theoretical?) new LTR in 2.x branch.

This in case that waiting for a stable 3.x (plus a reasonable set of
working python plugins!) would take too long, and the community would
decide or ask for another 2.x release to be able to do their daily work
with QGIS.

IF we are more or less sure that there will NO MORE 2.x QGIS (LTR's?)
anymore, we can decide to lift this clear 2.x - 3.x separation (thanks
Harrissou for defending this :-) ).

So the main question is: do we decide to NOT release a newer
documentation(!) 2.x branch anymore this year.

Regards,

Richard

Interesting. Let me bring my relative outsider's and newcomer's view 
into this. Although a long time QGIS user, I've never really dug into 
the Processing tools.

I'm working on a project, where one part is a plugin - mostly a 
relatively simple set of dialogs that integrate with other parts of the 
QGIS GUI. In another part of the project I develop datasets - and I've 
written some processing tools for that based on GDAL. I just yesterday 
cleaned two of them up a bit and put them into github and mentioned that 
on gdal-dev (I cc this email to gdal-dev). They're Perl programs that 
use also other Perl modules.

My intent is to release the plugin to my end users through a website - 
the QGIS plugin system allows one to add new library URLs, so I just 
need to write an XML file and put the plugin into a zip and upload that 
to our server to release a new version. I can make that into "make dist" 
or something. I'd like to keep this separate from the official plugin 
repository for separate identity and maybe because the plugin is really 
for this specific purpose without wider interest at least for now.

I just studied the Processing tools because it seems that maybe I could 
also make my processing tools available for my end users (or at least as 
a formal deliverable of our project) that way. There seems to be two 
possible approaches: 1) get the tools into QGIS-Processing or 2) make a 
distribution and ask the end users to install them and use the "Add 
script from file" tool in Processing tools (won't work out of box 
because python extension is hard coded there). The tools I've made are 
pretty generic but I wrote them as pure CLI tools and the other one I 
use for huge rasters so it takes a lot of time why I put them running 
into some cloud computers. Anyway I definitely see a benefit in running 
them from within QGIS and distributing them to end users - and with an 
additional code layer the input and output could be tied to layers in 
QGIS and dialog boxes. The same way as GDAL utilities are now usable 
from QGIS.

The QGIS Processing tools is already now a huge collection of tools. 
Some tools are there and directly usable (GDAL for example since I have 
GDAL in my computer), some tools can be downloaded for use, and some 
tools require that I install more software into my computer (TauDEM for 
example).

I see dangers in that one can easily download code from the web into 
his/her computer and execute it easily. This will be an issue at least 
with IT support of my end users.

I see the benefit of peer control/help/review over add-ons I develop and 
make usable by others in QGIS.

Right now I'm a bit confused and also perhaps awed by the potential of 
the QGIS Processing tools.

Cheers,

Ari

As a shortcut you can also build debian packages (see INSTALL). That will take
care of the dependencies (ie. complain about what's missing) and leave a build
directory in debian/build.   You could also interrupt the build once it's
setup.

Hi Richard,

The hipotetical extra 2.X LTR release was the piece that I was missing.
Thanks for reminding me of that.

So, maybe I started the wrong discussion and I should be asking if we
really are going to release another LTR in 2.x branch instead.

Since there is no active development in the 2.x branch, except for bug
fixes, maybe we can assume that the feature set would be the same as 2.18?

Back to my original concern: what do we do with documentation PRs aimed at
new features in the 3.X branch?

Moreover, with the new context help mechanism (thanks Richard and Alex Bruy
for that), If the developer wants to add a help button pointing to
documentation, he/we must be able to create new sections or at least put
some placeholders for it. Otherwise we won't be able to change that after
QGIS release (releasing documentation at the same time as QGIS IMHO is
still an utopia)

I know that we are in a exceptional situation because of 3.x release date
indefinition, but I think we should allow to document the master branch at
the same time it is coded. I just don't know how can we do it.

Also let me say that I share Harrissou opinion (from another thread) that
it's a pity that documentation is often forgot in the project's plans. With
all the changes happening in 3.0 we will be in deep trouble to have a good
3.2 documentation ready.

Thanks

Alexandre

Hi Alexandre,

the main reason holding back 3.0 descriptions from master is to be able
to release a (nowadays pretty theoretical?) new LTR in 2.x branch.

This in case that waiting for a stable 3.x (plus a reasonable set of
working python plugins!) would take too long, and the community would
decide or ask for another 2.x release to be able to do their daily work
with QGIS.

IF we are more or less sure that there will NO MORE 2.x QGIS (LTR's?)
anymore, we can decide to lift this clear 2.x - 3.x separation (thanks
Harrissou for defending this :-) ).

So the main question is: do we decide to NOT release a newer
documentation(!) 2.x branch anymore this year.

Regards,

Richard

So you can make a decision - just 2.x point releases ahead...

Hi,

Alexandre, Thanks for the clarification. Indeed we need to hear people once
for all on this (these) topic(s) and ensure any contribution is not
rejected or discouraged. And I think making PR guarantee that a
contribution is taken into account (we still have a queue shorter than QGIS
repo's :) )

Richard, I think it's more than clear that the next application release is
3.0 and the 2.x serie is behind us now. It's also clear that after 2.14,
the next LTR will be 3.2. Btw, we need to update a bit
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html#release-schedule
The 2.x vs 3.0 issue reports separation in Doc repo was at that time due to
the hypothetic release of a QGIS 2.20 which would be a LTR hence would
deserve a documentation (due to the rule "only LTRs are documented"). Now
there will be no 2.20 and the next LTR is two releases away so, as Richard
said "the main question is: do we decide to NOT release a newer
documentation(!) 2.x branch anymore this year.?" In other words: Do we keep
2.x series documentation at 2.14 level, while there are 2.16 and 2.18
releases that would surely be used for a while?

That's all! And I'm fine with whatever (argumented) answer is made! if the
answer is a categoric No :), let's pull 3.0 fixes
If the answer is "Yes, we want to release a 2.18 documentation" (without
translation of course), we can still begin working on 3.0 issues by
creating a master_2 branch for 2.18 fixes and port fixes from a branch to
another. It has been made with QGIS repo. I'm sure it 'd not be that hard
to maintain. It's not like if we have codes, it's all about text (more
understandable and cherry-pickable for me, anyway).

Btw, given that we are in dev list, allow me to remind that in the thread
in psc-list, there was a call for devs to help maintain and reinforce the
backend of documentation.... you are welcome... Thanks

Regards,
Harrissou

Got it - it's the renderer, not the layer itself:

Hi all,

as we discussed previously, from now Processing core distribution will include
support only for SAGA LTR version. This means that description files will be
updated only when new SAGA LTR version will be released. Pull-request with
corresponding changes already submitted [0] and I'm going to merge it soon if
there are no objections.

Support for other SAGA versions can be implemented as 3rd party provider plugins
by interested users.

Thanks Jürgen.  I see your approach.  I have done it with other packages 
but am not sure why I cannot get `pyqt5-dev` and `pyqt5-dev-tools` 5.6.1 
version directly from the `repo` as it did exist last year.  That would 
be the simplest solution.

I am not sure how other people managed to use Ubuntu 16.10.

Since I posted to the list.  I can be more specific the two packages are 
`pyqt5-dev` and `pyqt5-dev-tools` as `pyqt5.qsci-dev` not involved.

I haven't checked `python3-pyqt5 python3-pyqt5.qsci python3-pyqt5.qtsql 
python3-pyqt5.qtsvg` but am sure installing a specific a version of 
those isn't too difficult.

Without over complicating matters:

I think initial installers of Ubuntu 16.10 would have received Qt 5.6.1 
but those who waited until later would have received Qt 5.7.1, like me.  
I would say that's a Ubuntu 16.10 bug and probably lose reputation 
points.

PyQt5 or package `python-pyqt5` can be removed and installed with `sudo 
pip3 install` using the Qt 5.6.1 `.whl` file.  These specific packages 
from the `repo` are associated with Qt 5.7.1 while Ubuntu 16.10 defaults 
to Qt 5.6.1 and the QGIS core is built with that version.  This can be 
resolved in April by upgrading to Ubuntu 17.04, it says Qt 5.7.1 is 
used.

In the mean time, I plan to compare the differences between Qt 5.6.1, in 
the Ubuntu 16.10 install, and Qt 5.6.1, installed with the Qt 
maintenance tool.  This knowledge will make it much easier for me to 
check other versions of Qt as it is rapidly evolving.

This is what I changed to get what I had to build on Ubuntu 16.10.  I am 
using the free open source version of Qt directly from their website.

1.  I used the Qt Maintenance tool to install a local copy of Qt 5.7.1, 
to be consistent with `pyqt5-dev`, `pyqt5-dev-tools` and some other 
python packages, and modified `ccmake ..` to use it except for Qt5WebKit 
and Qt5WebKitWidgets which remained as configured.  That means in the 
ccmake I changed the path from Qt5Concurrent_DIR to Qt5Xml_DIR to 
`/home/<my username>/Qt/5.7/gcc_64/lib/cmake/...`

2.  I modified `qendian.h` in the Qt 5.7 folder `include/QtCore` I made 
beginning section of the Qt 5.7 file the same as Qt 5.6 for 
QT_HAS_BUILTIN ie.

`#ifdef __has_builtin
#  define QT_HAS_BUILTIN(x)     __has_builtin(x)
#else
#  define QT_HAS_BUILTIN(x)     0
#endif`

3.  In folder QGIS/src/core/qgis.h I added the line `#include 
<QIODevice>` before all other includes.  This eliminate a problem with a 
`isTransactionStarted` missing member of IODevice Class.  I did this 
because the header said must be included before any `open`.

4.  In folder QGIS/src/gui/qgisgui.h I added the line `#include 
<QIODevice>` before all other includes.  This eliminate a problem with a 
`isTransactionStarted` missing member of IODevice Class.

5.  In folder QGIS/src/gui/qgshelp.h I added the line `#include 
<QIODevice>` before all other includes.  This eliminate a problem with a 
`isTransactionStarted` missing member of IODevice Class.

Hopefully these changes will point the development team or someone to 
problems building on Ubuntu 16.10 64-bit - I did a full upgraded to it 
from 16.04 just a few days ago.  I did install `geos` 3.6 from source 
but that probably made little difference but a fix of that issue is now 
on Github.

The build continued until:
`[ 94%] Linking CXX shared library ../../output/lib/libqgis_app.so
[ 94%] Built target qgis_app`

There may have been an easier way but I didn't know what it was.  I am 
not that familiar with Qt.  I haven't resolve the db_manager issue.  
Anyone know how to fix that?

I hate to say this ... but I think your Ubuntu install must be in a
mess! It's really not that difficult at all from a clean Ubuntu 16.10
install, just a couple of steps after cloning the repo.

(as described in https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL#L187)

Will get you ALL the dependencies you need - there's no need for
downloading the libraries from Qt, and you can safely use Ubuntu's
default Qt 5.6.1 library.

Possibly you can revive your build by running the above command, then
building in a new folder, but I suspect there's a lot of
odd/incompatible library versions floating around on your system by
now. I'd start by install a nice clean 16.10 install in a virtual
machine and only running the above command to get the dependencies. If
this is successful (it will be!) you could then try to work out what's
required to repair your install.

Hope that helps!

Hello Chris,

QgsMapLayerRegistry does not exist anymore (since some weeks).
It's methods have been moved to QgsProject to allow having multiple 
project open at the same time.

So the GdalTools plugin does not seems up to date or compatible with 
current master branch of QGIS.
I'm not really aware of that plugin, but I do not see it in QGIS core 
repository.
Maybe this is an obsolete thing, and you could just remove it.

Have you followed the install doc : 
https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL
For using custom build of QGIS, you should :
Change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to some folder in your home instead of 
default one in system folder
     https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/blob/master/INSTALL#L256

And run QGIS using :
     export QGIS_PREFIX_PATH=~/apps/qgis-master
     export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$QGIS_PREFIX_PATH/lib
     $QGIS_PREFIX_PATH/bin/qgis

With a fresh build/install you should not get this error.

yakkety has pyqt5-dev-tools=5.7+dfsg-2.  But it actually depends on
python3-pyqt5=5.7+dfsg-2, which in turn is depends on libqt5core5a (>=
5.6.0~beta) - which is libqt5core5a=5.6.1+dfsg-3ubuntu6~4 in yakkety
(see [0] ff)

So no need to downgrade pyqt5 - it's built against Qt 5.6.1.

Mixing debs and pip might create a mess.  I'd avoid that.  And given the above,
there's no need to anyway.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] How do datum transformations work?
Message-ID: <b9d642bec39794a0dcdbb0a605b0f59a@carto.net>

Hi, 

I am struggling to find out how datum transformations work -
specifically also under QGIS Server. 

I have a .gsb file (CHENYX06a.gsb) for Swiss datum transformations. It
is located under /usr/local/shar/proj/ where all the other .gsb files
are. 

I also set the DEFAULT_DATUM_TRANSFORM variable variable in my
fcgid.conf file: 

  FcgidInitialEnv DEFAULT_DATUM_TRANSFORM
"EPSG:21781/EPSG:2056/100001/-1;EPSG:2056/EPSG:21781/-1/100001" 

I checked the entries in the srs.db on the server in the table
tbl_datum_transform which has an entry: 

wkt_geom coord_op_code epsg_nr source_crs_code target_crs_code
coord_op_method_code p1 p2 p3 p4 p5 p6 p7 remarks scope preferred
deprecated area_of_use_code
NULL 100001 15486 4149 4150 9615 0 

But how does QGIS know that it should use the CHENYX06a.gsb file as
grid-shift file? 

Where exactly does it find this information? 

Thank you for shedding some light on this mystery. 

Andreas

Message-ID: <e91cb051f561211ec00b5b968376fb47@shieldaig.com>

In summary, the apparent issue seems to have resulted from using `sudo 
pip3 install PyQt5` at some point as the latest version of it depends on 
Qt 5.7.1 while `sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5` depends on Qt 5.6.1 
and the symbolic link to `libQt5Core.so.5` points to 5.6.1.

Simply removing and purging packages and reinstalling does not easily 
correct this.

The observations regarding building using Qt 5.7.1 are still valid and 
don't seem to affect building using Qt 5.6.1.

Dear developers,

The QGIS Enhancement Proposal 79 "Dynamic Relations" describes a
possible approach to deal with the integration of a document management
system into QGIS projects.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS-Enhancement-Proposals/issues/79

I would like to ask core developers to express their consent or - even
more - any major objections with a +1, -1 (or use +0 or -0 if you feel
more comfortable ;) ).

If there are no major objections, I would like to mark this as accepted.
If there are major objections, please explain which parts in particular
are affected, what troubles could be caused by doing it this way or what
would be a better or more flexible approach for solving the requirements.

Thank you in advance and kind regards Matthias

Hi all,

One of my colleagues would like to write some unit tests for processing.
We were able to create some testfiles, but we failed to find an easy
way to run the testsuite on windows. Anyone a hint on the best way to
proceed?

Kind Regards,

Hi Johan,

Great to hear.

I am not aware of a possibility to run this on windows (not to say there
is none, I just don't have a win-system, so I never had to look into it :P )

Some options though:

 * Setup a virtual machine with linux to run the tests

 * Run the tests on travis.
    1. Create a fork of QGIS on github

    2. Enable travis for your fork

    3. Create a pull request against your own fork

Hope that helps,

Matthias

Hi,

If you can run docker and/or vagrant on Windows (and I'm pretty sure you
can), you might want to use on of or CI testing machines:

htps://hub.docker.com/r/boundlessgeo/qgis-testing-environment/tags/


master is current QGIS(3) master
master_2 is 2.18
release is 2.14

Hi all,

Martin, Nathan and myself have been chatting about the possibility of
a "mini-hackfest" happening in Australia this May. We figure that
while a couple of us are in the some part of the world it'd be nice to
get together and do a bit of coding!

We've discussed whether we want to do something more formal, like a 1
day user group meetup or mini conference, but in the end decided to
keep things super simple and informal so we can concentrate on what we
do best (hacking) and not get bogged down in the organisation details.

So basically the rough plan at the moment is just to find a venue,
probably in either Cairns or Darwin, with a room to hack in (and a bar
& swimming pool nearby!).

I realise there's a few contributors here from NZ and south east Asia
who may also be interested in attending. I also realise that there's
probably quite a few Europeans/Americans who may be keen for a good
excuse to take a holiday down here ;) So we're opening up discussions
to anyone else who may be interested in attending.

Just reply via the dev list or directly to Nathan/Martin/myself if
you're interested in getting involved.

Cheers,
Nyall

Sounds a greatidea. I've always be un favour of spreading the HF formula
all over.
All the best.

would love it, but not an efficient way of investing QGIS resources. it
would be great to have miniHF in sync, in different areas of the world.
we have started planning an IT HF in about the same period.

Hi,
sounds good you meet in that part of the world !

Essen hackfest will hold from 29 april to 1st may, that would be nice
having you guys in sync for the hackfest spirit .
Anyway, that would still be a bit asynchronous, since earth is round and
you live somewhere on the other side ;)

PS: I checked
https://www.freemaptools.com/tunnel-to-other-side-of-the-earth.htm and if
you plan a hackfest in Christchurch - NZ and europeans in Galicia, that
would be the exact opposite !

Cheers
Régis

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Error is QgsFeature API Documentation
Message-ID: <CABPxTTqgcauLnUD3MSRAdzrxxKb+-=XZ3OKejtd-oSabouQH1A@mail.gmail.com>

In the Documentation for QgsFeature

http://qgis.org/api/2.14/classQgsFeature.html

It lists two methods for accessing the attributes

QVariant     attribute (const QString &name) const
QVariant     attribute (int fieldIdx) const

If I use the first method it works fine (ie feature.attribute('City')) ,
but the second (ie feature.attribute(0)) fails with the message

QgsFeature.attribute(QString): argument 1 has unexpected type 'int'

If instead I just use an index such as

feature[fieldIdx]

where feature is a QgsFeature, it works fine.

Am I missing something here or is the second 'attribute' method invalid?

Thanks,

Calvin

It's valid in C++ - in python there is only the method taking the index.

Alternatively you can pythonically access the attribute with feature[fieldname]
and feature[fieldindex] (also for assignment) and iterate the attributes [attr
for attr in feature].

Hi Calvin,

have a look at the corresponding PyQGIS documentation for the
QgsFeature.attribute() method:

Hi all,
reviving the thread - Oslandia had the opportunity to work on speed up
improvements. 
So Paul  introduced an option to avoid unecessary checks on startup called
"Trust project when datasource has no metadata (id, extent, geometry type). 
His branch is here https://github.com/pblottiere/QGIS/tree/trust 

we plan to change the associated tooltip to: "Speed up project loading by
skipping data checks. Useful in qgis server context or project with huge
database views or materialized view."

If anyone has very big databases using views, it would be cool to test to
estimate how faster a project loads (and a getCapabilities is generated then
fort QGIS server)

Hi

A big "yay" from me for an aussifest - and hopefully if you can hold it in parallel to Essen, others around the world will follow suite!

Dear Dan,

QGIS uses Qt and pyQt (in python plugins).
You should install Qt4, pyQt4 and Python 2 for QGIS 2.x. The next 3.x QGIS 
release will use Qt5 and Python 3.

Regards
Zoltan

Before I ask this question on StackExchange, does anyone know how to 
completely remove the effects of using `sudo pip3 install PyQt5` as 
using `uninstall`, although it does remove a lot, doesn't seem 
completely up to the task?

`pip` is very useful.  I've reinstalled everything using `sudo apt-get` 
even tried purge options too.  I would prefer not to use a virtual 
machine, reinstall everything, etc..  I have also removed the build 
folder.  And even upgraded to Zesty.

I still either got this error
`Segmentation fault (core dumped)
python/plugins/db_manager/CMakeFiles/zzz-db_manager-15-depend.dir/build.make:72: 
recipe for target 'python/plugins/db_manager/ui_DlgAddGeometryColumn.py' 
failed

or no python support, because it does build, if I used `sudo pip3 
install PyQt5` because it is now 5.8 or other errors if I specified 
`==5.7`.

This seems like a `very very small` problem and I hope and I am not the 
only person trying to keep their system current and running into these 
kinds of problems.

Gordon

PS. I can switch everything to Qt 5.8 as I downloaded source build files 
for qtwebkit 5.7 and 5.8 and pypt5 5.7 and 5.8 but don't really want to 
do that either.  It does make the build environment more flexible.

​This is awesome! Looking forward in merging into QGIS.

But now I see that the Travis build gives an error...

Message-ID: <b42a5c9dbd65f5b09d95867aa1acddc2@tiscali.it>

  

Good afternoon,
I wanted to know if it was possible to develop a
plugin that expressed 
the following idea:
"Insert points on a given map
(assigning them a 'label), and clicking 
on each of these points, to
open a Notepad (Windows Journal) within 
which to me appears the name of
the point that has been selected and 
which the user can write the
information related to that area. 
Conversely, clicking on the name of
the point on the notepad, I must 
open the map in the position relative
to the point in question. "

I await your news.
Best regards.

So does that mean that you cant install and import tkinter and use it in a plugin or just that I should be using pyqt4?  Because I was just looking for a way that I could run an gui that we had already created for another purpose from qgis but being able to still be able to pass in data from qgis and have access to all the iface variables etc.

Hi all,
here I'm talking both as a client consultant and as a user (cartographer).

As many of you will know the cartographic production workflow often
requires post-production activities involving specific external software to
refine, compose, prepare layouts for printing.

In my context I often have to interface with Adobe softwares professionals
(Illustrator, inDesign, Photoshop) and, except for the simplest projects,
it can be a pain the exchange of QGIS compositions, where a lot of work can
be done but that, in certain situations, is lost because of QGIS Composer's
output limitats.

I love QGIS styling capabilities, I think they're reaching production grade
quality. I think the time is come to consider how the output could be
enhanced to make QGIS part of a complex workflow.
E.g. some collegues would be ready to leave tools like Avenza MAPublisher
if they could interoperate seamlessly between QGIS and Illustrator.

Probably a more advanced PDF output would be the first step.
One of the most important things would be the ability to export map layers
as PDF layers/groups (tree model) to have it back when importing the PDF in
external sw.
I'm just scratching the surface of a wide discussion, which demands a lot
of work, both from a conceptual and technical point of view. Direct
printing (plotting) management is another related topic.

I think it is worth spending some time to investigate it and share ideas,
 and when the it will be matured maybe a funding campaign could be a way to
give it the needed resources.

What's your opinion on this topic?

Regards,
Giovanni

Hi Giovanni!

As you've probably guessed... this is something I'm quite passionate
about and would also like to see us improve. Like you said, we've got
really strong symbology and cartography support inside of qgis, but
not so great interoperability with programs outside of QGIS.

One related request I frequently get is for support for CMYK workflows
within QGIS. And this is where the problem lies... we can't support
CMYK until Qt itself gains support for it. It's something we keep
bumping up against with this type of request and we're limited because
no-one on the QGIS project has links to the Qt project or can
influence their development decisions.

Unfortunately this is quite involved. At the moment QGIS is highly
tied into Qt's painter and printer framework. It's going to be very
difficult to change this and make a change like using another library
for exports. I think the most feasible approach would be to get the
changes we require implemented upstream in Qt itself. It's likely less
work, and also benefits other Qt projects too.

I'd also say that support for non-jpeg compressed images inside PDF
exports is critical. At the moment PDF is the only real choice for
export you have in QGIS (due to severe issues with SVG output (also a
Qt issue!) ) but unfortunately Qt forces jpg compressing on any
rasters included here. That's far from ideal for GIS or print
production work, and we need a way to keep these as lossless while
exporting PDFs.

We need to get alongside one of the Qt development crews (such as
KDAB) and discuss how to proceed with them. Paolo and I did this last
year to ask about CMYK support, and unfortunately they (KDAB) require
some payment up front to look into what's involved and how much it
would cost. We lost our sponsor at that stage and haven't yet been
able to pursue this any further.

I'm tempted that when the next round of QGIS grants comes up to apply
for a small grant for learning the Qt infrastructure, getting a feel
for the codebase and their contribution requirements, and getting a
patch to some upstream issue which affects us merged into Qt. I think
it's going to be critical moving forward with QGIS that we have a way
to influence and contribute to upstream so that we're no longer
restricted by limitations in the library.

Of course, there's still the issue that even if we get something fixed
upstream it could potentially be years before these fixes would be
available to QGIS end users... (hopefully snaps/flatpak/etc will help
here).

I would also strongly love to see us (QGIS users/developers) get SVG
export fixed upstream. The current state of SVG export in QGIS is
really embarrassing in my opinion :(

The GDAL PDF writer creates PDF "at hand" and is able to create layered PDFs :
http://gdal.org/frmt_pdf.html
Currently one raster layer, one "annotation" layer for legend, and several vector layers, 
mostly due to the API constraints of the GDAL API.
I'm not sure how feasible it would be (would require at least renumbering PDF objects and 
merging drawing instructions), but potentially you could render several layers into 
separate PDFs and then merge the PDFs into a single layered one

Just chiming in as a qgis-user: the best (imho) open source DTP software is
build with QT: scribus (https://www.scribus.net/). Afaik it does support
most things professional publishers need, such as CMYK workflows, high
quality PDF exports, etc. Might be worth taking a look at, or contacting
the devs about this, as they seem to have solved most of these problems?

Hi Nyall (and all the others).
I don't think SVG is the right way to go. Even if it is a great standard,
It's implementations vary too mich from sw to sw and it doesn't meant for
print productions. It's ok to exchange graphics but not to exhange document
models.

You raised the foundamental problem: the Qt PDF support lacks important
features, first of all CMYK. I don't know what Scribus uses for the output
(it will be interesting do have a look), OpenOrienteering has temporary
circumvented the problems forking and improving the QT PDF Printer [1] to
support CMYK exports.

@Even, I know that GDAL has a better backend for PDF export but I fear that
translating the QGIS rendering outputs (vectorials, texts, images) to a
different library would be a huge effort, don't you think?
And yes, obviously we can slice compositions in multiple objects and export
single PDF layers but it's very far from a production workflow! :)

I hope to see this topic grow, because I feel it's critical to QGIS
adoption and quality.

Giovanni

Yes, and I wouldn't certainly recommand doing that. The GDAL PDF styling capabilities are 
very limited. My point was rather to use the QT rendering backend to produce one PDF per 
QGIS layer, and then have some code that creates a single layered PDF from those multiple 
ones. Like when you concatenate several PDF into a multi page one with the 'convert' or 
'pdfunite' utilities. Except that I think creating a layered PDF would be a bit more tricky. 

> And yes, obviously we can slice compositions in multiple objects and export

That could potentially be completely automated and invisible to the user.

That said, improving the QT PDF capabilities to have native layering capabilities is probably 
cleaner / easier. My above proposal is more as a fallback solution in case a cleaner approach 
wouldn't be practical.

Ah ok, Even, I misunderstood you. Yes it can be a temporary hack, but as
you said teh layering would be tricky...

The problem is that i want to include inside it an ffmpeg static build

can upload it certainly on github, but is possible to put it also in the

Message-ID: <1487363500077-5308409.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello all

Some Mac (I think) users of qgis2web are experiencing problems with raster
exports:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/issues/148#issuecomment-250157682

http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/227049/cannot-export-raster-with-qgis2web-or-qgis2leaf

The raster export code tries a number of different combinations of
parameters, to try to handle different QGIS and GDAL versions:

https://github.com/tomchadwin/qgis2web/blob/master/leafletLayerScripts.py#L141

As you can see, it first tries one set of params if the QGIS version is
<=2.14. It then tries *three* more combinations of arguments. However,
plainly in some circumstances (as I say, I believe the common element is
MacOS), it still fails. This must mean that yet a different set of params is
required in these circumstances.

Can anyone work out what these parameters should be?

Thanks

Tom

Just today I made a little progress after numerous upgrades applied to 
Ubuntu 17.04.

There are several issues on my "messy" Ubuntu system  - and probably not 
on other Linux flavours.

This error seems odd, I hadn't seem it before, is there a fix?

`[ 88%] Building CXX object 
tests/src/gui/CMakeFiles/qgis_attributeformtest.dir/qrc_images.cpp.o
/home/gordon/dev/cpp/QGIS/build-master/python/gui/sip_guipart3.cpp:2929:7:

error: overriding non-deleted function ‘virtual

The other error, I am working on, after bringing up QGIS.

`version `Qt_5.8' not found (required by 
/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/PyQt5/QtCore.so)`

I can install PyQt5.7.1 built using Qt5.7.1.  Hopefully that will work.  
As it will be built with Qt5.7.1.

It has made me wonder how many "cores" were used to build pre-packaged 
libraries, anyone know?


Qt5.8, is not possible for me without completely rebuilding libraries 
which are prebuilt with an out-of-date Unicode `libicu` version 57 and 
building from source has errors due to new icu version 58 not being 
picked up.  I am not attempting that.

Hi

+1 from me too to switch to "stroke" and charcoal instead of black.

Hi,

Thanks for this work.

+1 for stroke

+0 for opacity/transparency, but let's pick one of them for QGIS overall.

+1 for not using  black, but please make it a really dark gray because I 
think maps look crappy when the outline color gets lighter than the fill 
color. (As I notice sometimes in another desktop GIS...)

Besides, talking about this subject, I would love a tool for changing 
all the black stuff in map composers to another color. Texts, scale 
bars, frames, everything at once. Or does this already exist?

Regards,
Raymond

I'd be glad to help but haven't had a hands-on with ArcGIS for years ...

​Imho, the linked article is the GIS media version of click-bait. Very
superficial, one line per topic. Some of the lines make me question how
much the author knows about GIS technology in general.

Best wishes,

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Stationary objects that change attribute values
	over time
Message-ID: <CAFFV8FjnB7DJcNMPeJoUGnFVagPwLZzVfszuJFfQmJeoH5sfAQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm looking for a better way to handle stationary objects in Time Manager.
For example, think of a real estate map, where plots of land change value
over time. The geometries themselves rarely ever change.

Currently. It is necessary to create a join of plot geometries and values
over time, duplicating geometries and creating potentially huge layers.

So far, my thoughts are going in the direction of creating query layers for
such cases. The query layer definition could be controlled by Time Manager,
to always update according to the requested time frame.

Does that sound reasonable? Do you have other ideas or are there any plans
about adding temporal support to QGIS3 that I should be aware of?

Thanks and best wishes,
Anita

​+1
I'd be glad to help but haven't had a hands-on with ArcGIS for years ...

​Imho, the linked article is the GIS media version of click-bait. Very superficial, one line per topic. Some of the lines make me question how much the author knows about GIS technology in general.

Best wishes,
Anita

I guess I should chime in here on this thread, too :), since I was invoked
originally:

Definitely to +1 on Stroke.

As for transparency vs. opacity, as I wrote in that email:

* Why does QGIS use Transparency sliders instead of Opacity sliders?
  Isn't Opacity much more common in graphics software?

To expand a little more, both Photoshop and Illustrator use Opacity
sliders -- far left is 0% opacity / full transparency. (Although
curiously, Illustrator's is inside the Transparency window.)

Are there prominent examples of software packages (in the GIS world?)
that use Transparency instead of Opacity in sliders?

For the tols I use, Opacity wins hands-down. I gather that's not true
for everyone, but I wonder what the tools are that use Transparency
sliders (far left is 100% opacity / no transparency).

I would say, also, that Opacity is a little more intuitive, because
it basically translates to Brightness. If you ask a user which way
they turn the knob to make a line darker, they'll usually turn it in
the positive director (err, s/knob/slider/).


I would say, also, that the internal API is very different from the
UI. What's the justification for changing the API on this? Confusion
to API developers? Is that really worth it?

p.s.: I had anticipated having more time to file QGIS bugs and stuff
and that hasn't really happened. Although part of it is that it took
an awful long time to get an osgeo account and even longer to get a 
wiki account...nearly a week for the latter. Anyhow, it's still my
intention.

+1 for stroke

+0 for opacity/transparency, but let's pick one of them for QGIS overall.

+1 for not using  black, but please make it a really dark gray because I 
think maps look crappy when the outline color gets lighter than the fill 
color. (As I notice sometimes in another desktop GIS...)

Besides, talking about this subject, I would love a tool for changing 
all the black stuff in map composers to another color. Texts, scale 
bars, frames, everything at once. Or does this already exist?

Regards,
Raymond

Message-ID: <7017fa947887cd31eeb6fdbcbcce055f@shieldaig.com>

The reason for the difference between `pip3 install` and `sudo apt-get 
install` of python3 packages, at least on my system, is where the 
packages are stored:

`/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages` and `/usr/lib/python35/dist-packages` 
respectively.

Not sure I understand why the difference, whether it can be easily 
managed, or even if it is a problem.  It just seemed to make a 
difference.

Rather than say people have a "messy" Ubuntu system, when it isn't, this 
information may be helpful as `python pip` and variants are widely used.

Using Qt5.7.1 sources to rebuilding QtCore.so and PyQt5, using a Qt5.7.1 
build kit, seems more possible and I will try that when I have time.  I 
am in "awe" of all the work that went into providing these shared 
modules but having to create new clean environments to build and use a 
software applications shouldn't be necessary.

I would also like to know when QGIS plans to depart from QtWebKit to 
QtWebEngine and same for Widgets.  Anyone know?

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Future of standalone browser?
Message-ID: <CAB28AshM4BZ1tzNHxvv-9TZhXF+FWsfwnMAE9szTzRq8qwT-fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just wanted to raise the discussion about the future of the standalone
QGIS browser.

The current situation (as I see it)

- Ignoring a tiny change I made a couple of days ago (to make the
preview use a pan tool), the last commit to standalone browser
(besides general api fixes) was... adding a new icon in may 2015.

- The standalone browser is very limited. There's lots of
functionality available in the browser panel in the main app which
isn't available in the standalone browser, like the search filter and
everything in the right click context menus.

- The current state of the standalone browser is "schizophrenic" at
best. It's predominantly a read-only display of data, but with some
extra random functionality in a toolbar (add wms server (what about
wfs/wcs/etc?), create shapefile (what about spatialite/geopackage?),
set layer projection)

- The UI is very unpolished - eg there's a "header" header over the
browser tree (http://mappinggis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5.png)

I'm guessing, given this, that there's not a lot of demand for the
standalone browser. This may either be due to lack of interest in this
functionality in general, or else just a reflection of the current
limited functionality available in it.

So what should we do with the standalone browser in 3.0 and future? is
there a future here, or should we just drop this functionality and
save ourselves the maintenance burden? And if there IS interest in
keeping the browser around, is anyone able to step up and sponsor some
investment into making browser more useful and polished?

My (perhaps unpopular) point of view is that we should get rid of it:

* It is a regular source of confusion in training courses where people end up starting the browser instead of QGIS
* QGIS starts quickly enough that it is fairly trivial to use QGIS itself to have a quick preview of a dataset
* Whilst I regularly use the browser in QGIS itself, I have never had need to use it in standalone mode
* It's more stuff to maintain

I'd be far more interested in a QGIS browser based dialog that can be used as the basis for a unified 'add layer' dialog than the standalone version.

Maybe it would be good to hear from folks who have a good use case for keeping it to see what we are missing here....

My POW:

Get rid of it and use developer ressources to reduce start-up time for 
the main QGIS program in stead.

Hi all,

My feeling is that the standalone browser should be retired and not included in version 3.0. I don't think it provides any functionality that isn't already provided in QGIS and the browser panel and in my view is now obsolete.

As an aside, how easy would it be to adapt the standalone browser code to serve as a QGIS dialog for adding vector and raster layers? 

Frank.

Hi all,

Just wanted to raise the discussion about the future of the standalone
QGIS browser.

The current situation (as I see it)

- Ignoring a tiny change I made a couple of days ago (to make the
preview use a pan tool), the last commit to standalone browser
(besides general api fixes) was... adding a new icon in may 2015.

- The standalone browser is very limited. There's lots of
functionality available in the browser panel in the main app which
isn't available in the standalone browser, like the search filter and
everything in the right click context menus.

- The current state of the standalone browser is "schizophrenic" at
best. It's predominantly a read-only display of data, but with some
extra random functionality in a toolbar (add wms server (what about
wfs/wcs/etc?), create shapefile (what about spatialite/geopackage?),
set layer projection)

- The UI is very unpolished - eg there's a "header" header over the
browser tree (http://mappinggis.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/5.png)

I'm guessing, given this, that there's not a lot of demand for the
standalone browser. This may either be due to lack of interest in this
functionality in general, or else just a reflection of the current
limited functionality available in it.

So what should we do with the standalone browser in 3.0 and future? is
there a future here, or should we just drop this functionality and
save ourselves the maintenance burden? And if there IS interest in
keeping the browser around, is anyone able to step up and sponsor some
investment into making browser more useful and polished?

Nyall

Hi Nyall,

I would be ok too to drop de browser (mainly because I've never used it
standalone, and seeing Tim's first point in practice too).
But what I'm wondering is what code is shared between the
Browser-panel-widget and the stand alone one.
Because some of your points are also valid for the widget? And I have a
troublesome relation with the widget too:
- eating cpu when you have a WMS-node or db node open when you
stop/start QGIS
- very silent failing of drag en drop behaviour (if it works it works,
but ...)
- missing datatypes/services too

So same questions for the panel/widget?

In general I'm in favour of making QGIS as lean as possible for 3.0, it
will gain weight in near future anyway. And this is the only time in
near future that we can do such a diet :-)

Regards,

Richard D

It's the same code, just in dock form.  I find the browser dock to be super
helpful but have never used the standalone version.

Agreed here,
never used it, and it sends a wrong message saying Esri UX choices are good
enough to be copied. Let's get rid of it :)

Agreed with most people here:
* never used it myself
* never seen used by anyone
* very confusing for the users (especially when it had the same desktop
icon as main app).
On the other hand, I find the docked version superuseful and intuitive,
although I agree with Richard that it should be streamlined, hopefully
replacing the (too) many "Add this and that" buttons.
Thanks Nyall for raising the issue.
All the best.

I agree for dropping it. Never used and many partecipants to our courses
were doubtful of its usefulness.

I guess it was meant to be similar to ESRI ArcCatalog but in that case a
lot more of functionalities should be implemented to give it a reason to
exist as a standalone sw.

Yes - I should have stressed this more. I love the in-app browser dock
and think it's vital to using QGIS. It's not going anywhere!

Seems like quite a consensus that the standalone browser should go.
Does anyone know the history here? I'd like to hear from the original
developer as to whether this was a funded project which could cause
issues with removal or if it's no longer required by them either...

Seems like a strong consensus here for "stroke". I'll try and make
this change sometime this week (should be mostly search and replace)

great, thanks. how about Opacity vs Transparency?

My preference would be for opacity too.

An outstanding question is what range we should allow? Behind the
scenes it's generally going to be converted to a 0-255 value, but for
users a 0-100% may be more explanatory. Opinions?

The API is ALL OVER THE PLACE here, and should also be fixed. We have
a mix of transparency/opacity/alpha and ranges of 0-1, 0-100, 0-255.
It's confusing for developers too!

Um, one minute you request a change and the other you want to have it killed.
I should have better used the time to finish it ;)

Hi all,
any special reason Procesing options should remain in the Processing
menu, instead of being moved to the general options dialog?
II think this will be easier and more understandable for the user.
All the best.

Hi Nyall

we (Radim and me) have added it long time ago within a small contract where
people wanted a simple standalone app for preview of data files (with an
assortment of other functionality that was not yet available in qgis app at
the time). Personally I have never been too attached to the idea of a
standalone browser, but thats how they wanted it.

Nowadays, the browser dock integrated inside qgis has richer functionality
and in general much more potential, so I think it would be fine to get rid
of the standalone browser - obviously it is barely used and not really
developed by anyone...

Cheers
Martin

Opacity is more coherent with graphic softwares (and I generally talk about
opacity when designing maps) but IMHO transparency is more intuitive for
the lay users, and it's a quite conmon terminology in GIS softwares.

Maybe opacity could be used for styling and transaprency for the global
layer rendering (general layer properties, etc.), both for vectors and
rasters.

Sorry - that commit comment just started me thinking about what it's
future is. I actually didn't expect that there would be such strong
consensus to remove it, and thought that this discussion was more
likely to result in suggestions for improving it and several people
saying "i can't live without it!". Apologies if your effort on that
commit wasn't required...

I've thought this too.

We'd need a way for plugins to embed panels inside the general options
first though. This would also allow us to move the python console
options here too. In general it might help reduce UI clutter though
plugins creating menu items just for a config dialog (i.e. the Win95
style menus "Plugins - > Super Team Pty Ltd -> Super Team Awesome
Plugin -> Super Team Awesome Plugin v1.0 settings" )

I once did that for vector layers (globe uses this) and Nathan reworked
it a bit for the styling dock IIRC, it probably wouldn't be hard to copy
this code.

+1. I like the idea, and I hnk that, if it is possible to add options
from plugins in the settings dialog, it should be mandatory for
plugins to do so, for the sake of homogeneity, instead of creating
their own.

Personally I never used but recently I realized that, in some work
environment, there are people working only on organizing data. In this
case working on a specific standalone standalone (only newest and
updated code showing only dhe Browser dock) would simplify the user
experience. Nothing that can not be done using GUI configuration and
user profiles => get rid of Browser standalone app!

tnx

Hi,

I never used it, and it is definitely a source of confusion in workshops.

I've never used the browser much, I can't say I would miss it if it's
retired.

The one thing I'd miss a bit is its capability at quickly previewing
datasets. I'm wondering if this could be somehow integrated into the QGIS'
browser dock (maybe now made possible following the major layer registry /
project refactoring which has taken place prior to 3.0?). Just like the
information panel, we could have a preview panel that renders a preview of
the vector/raster dataset.

Anyhow; +1 to see the standalone browser gone. :)

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Plans for next QGIS releases
Message-ID: <f8c11596-d215-64ee-cad3-f995dfba964e@faunalia.it>

Hi all,
during a fast and productive IRC meeting today we have come out with a
proposal for the management of current and future versions of QGIS:

* retire 2.14 in June 2017
* 2.18 becomes LTR from June 2017 to 2018
* 3.0 feature freeze in July 2017
* release 3.0 in Sept 2017
* release 3.2 as next LTR in release 3.0 + 4 Months (eta June 2018).

Of course we know that some of you will have different preferences and
constraints, but we believe this is the best compromise we can reach
now. Please let us know if you have strong opposition to this, or good
argument to change. Nothing is carved in stone, but it will be good to
give our users and devs a perspective on what they can expect.

All the best.

Message-ID: <CAH=WbRBnkZ7wm8stn6t8oKrtC44Yz-UPChvVQfJeUjy4gfixmQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

This is more of an issue with gdal/osgeo4w installer than QGIS. But there
is an inconsistency how netcdf4 files are being handled in Windows/Linux
from QGIS users' point of view.

Here is a ticket related to the issue:
https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/ticket/293

and SE discussion:
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/179132/gdal-nc-rasters-opened-as-netcdf-network-common-data-format-under-linux-an

I guess this will be resolved if a newer version of netcdf is shipped with
QGIS.

Regards
Saber

Message-ID: <CAECJsSrf5m4x0Aje0ix72t2XuDANsz6bDpiwqrQK5zHGxZ9A9A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've enabled QGIS 3 on a Windows machine where 2.18 and 2.14 are also
installed.
I was expecting to have some of my configurations kept but all was new (use
of the system locale , use of epsg:4326, otf off, didn't keep my custom
symbols... regardless my choices for 2.x release).

While I understand that QGIS 3 picks user configuration from a new .qgis3
folder, I wonder if this one shouldn't be populated with the current
configs of the user (when compatible). I'm not sure that all end users will
understand and could workaround these changes.

Hi, what would be a good python version to use for a new plugin? 2.7 or 
3?
And is it QGIS 2.14 LTR that I should support for now?

Seems to be a lot of new stuff in the near future...

The tools I use again express opacity in 0-100%, and I think that's
the correct thing for the user interface. Why should users presume
the internals are going to be 8-bit unsigned? Why shouldn't it be
0-65536? Or floating point?

So, I imagine at some point in the future someone is going to
decide 8-bit alpha channels are too limiting. The API should
probably be forward-looking with respect to that. I'm not
sure exactly what that means, but to me it suggests
not 0-255. Maybe 0-1 floating point. But I dunno.

I'd say in the API we should be closer to the data and hence use 0-255, in the slider we convert it to 0-100%.
We could possibly have a slider that allows for 255 positions but prints numbers from 0%-100%?

Are you aware of systems where there are more values than 8 bits for the alpha channel (for which we should prepare)?
It wouldn't be a much bigger deal to go this road, but I think it shouldn't be purely prophylactic without real needs in mind.

I'd be speaking out of school.

It appears to me that netpbm's pgm supports 16-bit alpha channels
http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/pgm.html
and it looks to me like Photoshop supports them as well (in 16bpp file), and 
a cursory reading of the PDF 1.7 Reference suggests no limitation to 8 bits.

But I could definitely be misreading this.

Hi Paolo,

Please excuse me if I missed something, but I am quite surprised, not by
the decisions themselves, but the process of these decisions.

I have seen no call for meeting, no message to the list to gather
advices, no mention to voting members neither of this IRC meeting happening.
The topic is really important and has deep consequences for all of our
users, funders, developers. The least we can do is ask them for their
advice and feedback. This kind of autocratic top-bottom decisions is
definitely not the way I would expect the QGIS community to behave.

Sorry for the rant, and again I may have missed something ( but I
re-checked all emails from PSC, dev and users ML, my #qgis logs, and saw
nothing). Let's keep the community involved in decision processes and
take care about how we communicate together, please.

Vincent

Hi Vincent,
we had a quick meeting among people who is doing most of the work. What
I communicated seemed the best option, and we submitted it to the list
exactly to have a more general discussion and feedback. So, if you or
anybody have better suggestions, let's discuss it.
All the best.

Message-ID: <CAH5HFGm7PNzYxe+fgGWM1kkXZgQ0qwaJVnzXf_fzZASKvLn=tg@mail.gmail.com>

It's not a detailed comparison but this short blog post, published
yesterday, from a couple of Defra employees (UK Government Department for
Environment, Food & Rural Affairs) indicates that Defra recognises the
value in using and supporting both QGIS and ArcGIS side by side.

https://defradigital.blog.gov.uk/2017/02/20/the-right-gis-tool-for-the-job/

The really interesting revelation for me was that Defra is now officially
supporting QGIS. Not so long ago I supported a Defra employee with QGIS and
he had to jump through all sorts of hoops to get it installed on his work
machine.

Budgets in UK government are tighter than ever, and tighter than most at
Defra. I can only see this journey continuing in one direction.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but seems that the Map Settings variables
of map items in the print composer are not being updated when the map item
changes.

It seems to be just a display problem. using one of the variables somewhere
works are expected.

Bug?

​Just to confirm what Paolo said, the issue was raised by Paolo at our PSC
meeting 2 months ago (all meeting minutes are publicly available at
https://github.com/qgis/qgis/wiki#psc-meeting-minutes), and the suggested
approach was:

* form a small group of core developers to come up with a viable proposal
for 3.x plans - Done
* present the proposal to the mailing list for further discussion ​- Done
* based on feedback from the discussion publicise the plan further on the
QGIS blog - (still to be done)

There are many viable responses including:

* agreeing with the proposal here on the mailing list
* disagreeing and providing substantive reasons why and a clear alternative
* proposing that the issue goes to a voting member vote if there are
conflicting alternatives

I think this is all pretty clear and transparent - and I think it is better
to start the discussion with a viable solution rather than an extremely
broad and open ended question like 'how shall we handle the release?' as a
starting point -  which is going to lead to a jumbled flow of hard to
manage proposals.

So to summarize, we are doing out best to keep all communications in the
project open and transparent, if there are substantive suggestions about
how to improve things, just share them here and we will do our best to
incorporate them.


Regards

Tim

Unfortunately the last meeting is not available yet... :)

I don't get the idea of making the 2.18 a LTR release just for half a year. 
Or are we going to support it longer, in parallel with the 3.2 LTR? Or maybe 
nobody believes the 3.2 will be stable enough to make it a LTR? :)

Personally I was hoping for 2.18 LTR to last from June 2017 to June 2018
and then releasing 3.2 In June 2018.

* retire 2.14 in June 2017
* 2.18 becomes LTR from June 2017 to
​**​
​*June*** ​
2018
* 3.0 feature freeze in July 2017
* release 3.0 in Sept 2017
* release 3.2 as next LTR in release 3.0 + 4 Months (eta June 2018).​

​Regards

Tim​

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Resize QGIS line or polygon about its centroid
Message-ID: <CABPxTTojYb6VsXYm9EaZ6VR+NkKt51rUrgeegRNF-+KDYv6qKw@mail.gmail.com>

I have an project where I want a feature to be larger than life just so
that it shows up on the map. Ideally I would like is to be able to select
one of more features and with the mouse have it interactively resize them,
but keeping them centered about their centroids. Once I am satisfied with
their size I would either click a button to fix them or hit the Enter key.

I saw the Affine transformations plugin, but that takes too much thought.
Is this capability already there and am just not finding it or has it
simply not been done? If the latter is the case I may consider writing the
plugin to do it although I think it would be nice for it to be a part of
the standard QGIS editing functions.

Thanks,

Calvin

According to the latest news, it seems that there will make sense to have a
2.18 Documentation release...

Sorry for trying to "rush" it to 3.0. Or will it be 3.2?

Anyway, I am going to put some effort in fixing 2.x issues in the user's
manual.

I am all for moving ahead.

I was checking out another application with `valgrind` on Ubuntu 17.04 
64-bit so thought I would give `qgis` a try eg.

valgrind --leak-check=full ./output/bin/qgis

Is this only with my build (simply entering and exiting the qgis 
application) or does it affect anyone else?  Are there better tools?

Valgrind is great, but slows things down a LOT. lsan (via clang) isn't
quite as thorough but doesn't slow things down as much.

Do you have the full valgrind report? There IS leaks in QGIS.... but
the known ones are harmless (eg the metadata for QgsVectorFileWriter
is leaked, but it occurs only once per session). I also see a lot of
leaks when I run valgrind under Ubuntu because of Unity's dbus menu
integration.

Keen to hear if you do find any leaks inside QGIS itself though!

Hi Calvin,
what you describe requires to store the specific object size somewhere,
which is the exact same requirement with data defined labeling (or any data
defined stuff in QGIS, those widgets are everywhere).
Modifying the source layer is quite wrong, and sometimes impossible
(readonly datasets). You can have a look to EasyCustomLabeling where I
coded a duplication of the objects I needed to label into a memory layer.
Persistence is made thanks to MemoryLayerSaver plugin that saves them in a
separated .mldata file. In you case, a symbol is made of so much markers,
sub markers that you can't just define one width or size parameter shortcut
button (or mouse scroll + key modifier) so easily.

This is anyway quite hacky and justify a planned and funded work for QGIS3
: Auxiliary storage. That work will provide a way to store data or other
ressources inside the qgs project. That will provide a nicer and more
portable method for custom labeling or styling.

Just to end up with your cartographic need, up to now, I've always managed
to handle what you describe with conditional rules in expressions without
having to manually storing values. I eventually had to store exceptions to
rules in the following way:

Ex: Styling city point with size proportional to the number of inhabitants
, except for one

CASE
  WHEN city = 'Grenoble' then  22
  ELSE scale_exp("altitude", 0, 0, 1, 10, 0.5)
END

I hope that helps
Cheers Régis

Hi,
I recently answered to a question on GIS StackExchange [0]. In this
question, the asker was looking for a way for dissolving features using an
adjacency criterion instead of using common attribute field (please, follow
the link below for a better understanding). This feature is already
available in the analogous ArcGIS tool when the"Create multipart features"
option is enabled and I think it could be of interest having an additional
option like this in the "Dissolve" tool main dialog for next releases.
I never submitted a feature request on the QGIS Project site but, since
there is already a (very rough) code and a general idea on how to approach
the issue, I didn't know if this was the case of adding it there.
Otherwise, let me know if I need to add it on the QGIS Project site (if
this is the case, I'm sorry for wasting your time).

Hello,

the example on StackExchange seems to do this for the currently
selected features.

It might also be desirable to do this for an entire layer, e.g. join
at all places where exactly two line features are adjacent. (I think
v.build.polylines does this, but apparently it is not available from
QGIS.)

A while ago I created a processing script for this, with (compared to
the StackExchange example) some more configurability and optimization
with a spatial index.

I just don't know, what is the best place to upload a processing
script? As a PR against qgis/QGIS-Processing on github?

Kind regards,
Daan

Hi Marco,

The Dissolve tool already has a "unique fields" option. It sounds like you
are reinventing that.

Best wishes,
Anita

Hi all,

Where can I found this daily osgeo4w installer ?

Is it here : http://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/?C=M;O=D

Last build seems dated from : 14-Nov-2016

Is there a place where we can get more recent build for windows ?

Hi Marco,

there is an OGR geoalgorithm that seems to do what you are describing

in QGIS Processing (Dissolve polygons) maybe its easy to adapt it

to also work with lines ...

Hi Anita, that does not do what Marco is asking for, because you get a multipart geometry;

he needs a linestring geometry I think...

Thanks to all for the answers! I really appreciate.

@Daan, actually it should work for all the features for a specific field (I
set it inside the code, but it may easily become an input parameter). So,
after the setting of a specific field, the code will dissolve all the
features which have the same attribute and that are adjacent (see the
sample image in the answer).

@Anita, I think would be a new feature because, starting from the features
with the same attribute value, I try to only dissolve those ones which are
adjacent (so, it should be an additional feature to the "Unique ID fields"
option).

@roy roy, I never used that tool but it does the same thing I'm trying to
do for linestring geometries. It could be interesting having a similar
feature (for both polygon and linestring vector) in the QGIS geoalgorithms!

Regards,
Marco

You can run multiplart to singlepart afterwards.

Hmm maybe I'm wrong, but I think it will only return singleparts without
taking care of an adjacency criterion (even if ran after the dissolving
operation).

For the dailies/nightlies.  It has:

qgis-ltr (2.14 release)
qgis-ltr-dev (nightlies of release-2_14)
qgis (2.18 release)
qgis-rel-dev (nightlies of release-2_18)
qgis-dev (nightlies of master)

There are only weekly snapshots of qgis-dev in OSGeo4W.  One so far - while
there were no master builds, it was switched to qgis-rel-dev (now removed to
make room).

No need - but you can also have several OSGeo4W installs in different
directories (eg. using the same package directory).

But the NSIS installer is available at http://qgis.org/downloads/weekly/ now
too.

What about making 3.2 a normal editon and then release 3.4 LTR? So:

* 2.18 becomes LTR from June 2017 to June ​2018
* release 3.0 in Sept 2017
* release 3.2 in January 2018
* release 3.4 LTR in June 2018

Other options would be: retire 2.18 LTR in January 2018 or postpone 3.2 until 
June 2018. Both look unacceptable for me. Who would deploy an LTR for a half 
an year? With dropped 2.14 support and 3.0 too young we'll be left without any 
stable version. And postponing the 3.2 release would only restrain the process 
of testing and maturation of QGIS 3.

Hi,

I think there usually (ok! it happens only once) is an overlap between two
LT releases: 2.8 was maintained few months after 2.14 (I think it was
stopped when 2.16 was released) -
http://qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/development/roadmap.html
So following that logic, 3.2 would be released in january and replace 2.18
in june as LTR (with the release of 3.4)

Hi Regis,

I would assume that in this use case the user would not be modifying the
source polygons, but would make a copy of them which could be a memory
layer and then resize them. I mentioned resizing small features so that
they visibly would be better shown on the map, but the other use case would
be when the user draws a polygon and would then like to shrink or enlarge
it, then perhaps move it into position. QGIS already has the move tool, but
I don't see one to shrink or enlarge polygon tool.

I understand how a point label's size can be modified based on some
attribute, but can an expression be written that would allow a polygon size
be scaled and centered about the source centroid, based on some attribute
in the data. If that is possible I don't know how it would be done.

Thanks,

Calvin

It's an option, too. The question is which one is supposed to be more mature, 
stable and polished: 3.2.5 or 3.4.0. Anyway, in both cases the lifetime of 
2.18 LTR seems to be clear now.

Personally I would like to see a 3.x release become LTR as soon as
possible. 3.0 should be skipped because despite it's incredibly high
stability there could potentially still be problems. So the next in line
is 3.2.

I think having 2.18.x and 3.2.x available in parallel for an extended
period is a good thing. The 3.x transition will take some time. So let's
give a nice and long enough grace period to end users and orgs but with
a clear deadline for 2.18 so we are not stuck in the 2 release series
forever.

Yes.

We build for two package repositories.   One is fed by the long term release
branch and the other for the latest release.   When a new LTR is released we
have a period where the latest releases is also the LTR release.  While that
lasts the old LTR is still used to feed the LTR and the new LTR feeds the
latest release package repository. 

Only when the following release goes to the latest release repositories, the
new LTR actually enters the LTR repositories.

So we never have to maintain more than two release branches.

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Field Menu Range settings odd behaviour

Hi,

working with Field menu range in QGIS 2.18 I notice that the problem

is still there despite the introduction of costraint:

say that i want to set a range for an integer field
called "numfield" with

min value 1

max value 5

step 1

at this point i would expect that QGIS only accepts "1 2 3 4 5" and
throw an error if i insert 6

to enforce this behaviour I set some costraints:

not NULL

"numfield" >= 1 AND "numfield" <=5

while editing infact if i erroneously insert "6" QGIS will not complain
and will happily save the maximun value for range (i.e. 5) i find this odd
and a way to defeat the hole pourpose of my setting.

What is really happening is that QGIS automatically change the value I insert
with the max range value which is clearly an error that leads to data corruption;

if someone can confirm i'll open a Bug report.

Thanks, Roy.

Hi all,
in QGIS 2.18.3, apparently concentration maps are not displayed if
rendering effects are enabled: does someone please confirm?
All the best, and thanks.

Oh, I didn't get that you want to actually change the geometry itself not
its style.
I usually don't play with geometry for representation purpose, or sometimes
I store alternate geometries but I keep the original one.
Are you aware of the geometry generator renderer ? You could apply a
translation based on data defined expression to make on the fly
modifications without creating any data. What you need is still unclear to
me, maybe some screenshots or drawings could help.

Cheers
Régis

Perhaps you're looking for the "merge lines" tool? That will join the
parts of a multilinestring into single connected linestrings (where
possible).

My usual process is to chain dissolve -> merge lines -> multiparts to
singleparts.

Sounds like it. Is this on master? Can you open a ticket with a

Hi,
we at Tuscany Region in 2013 fundedthe adding of the support of scale
legend in the wms provider.
That (if I remenber was added to the 2.2 or 2.4 version of qgis).

These are the commit for that adding:

>From the 2.6 version as I remenber it was removed

I never understand why this feature was removed, but now the question
is re-issue in a discussion in an our internal working team , about
the usage of QGIS and so I need to confirm the removing and report the
explanation of why to my superiors.

Effectivelly my tests on the qgis 2.18 on an our wms ehre the legend
is sensible to the scale confirm that it is not working, but I still
don't know why it was removed.

Someone can confirm me and give us some explanation of why this
feature was removed ?

Many Thx,

Andrea Peri

Do you have the commit where it was removed?  That would normally have the
message on why.

Hi Nathan I find only this commit.

https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/commit/836e1a86368f9eace236d24ba40b7af77a6bc63d

But it speak of

don't refresh legend symbology everytime the extent changes

I'm not so skill on qgis code to understand what it do.
Our feture was for a retrieving of the new legend when scale change
(so on zoom action), not on a pan action.

So perhaps is not the right commit.

No more I found.

Which parts are missing or broken? I just quickly flicked through
those commits and the code at least all seems to still be there in
2.18/master. (I didn't test the functionality, and noticed that
unfortunately there's no unit tests covering any of the original
work.)

Hi Yves,

Sounds good! I tried but couldn't find a way to make this work. Can I 
find a description somewhere?

Message-ID: <CABPxTTpCL-h9ah9sjS8FyxNEzFeVCb51tSfMbtsYtPf71kagXA@mail.gmail.com>

My real purpose here was to see if I had missed the tool that I would like
to see in QGIS. Sometimes with the more complex plugins there are
capabilities there that are not at first obvious. It appears to me that an
interactive geometry resize tool does not exist, but I could create it. I
wanted to make sure I wouldn't be duplicating effort. Here is how I would
like it to work:

1. Select a layer and one or more features.
2. With the resize geometry tool selected, as the user clicks on the map
and drags up and to the right the geometry would be enlarged about the
feature's centroid. If the user drags down and to the left it would be
shrunk and if the user keeps dragging it would ultimately be flipped.
3. One of the options would be to constrain the aspect ratio, but latitude
and longitude resize would be independently affected without the aspect
ratio constraint.
4. I would have at least two modes for the resize. One would be based on
the CRS of the layer. The other would be to do all the math using
geographiclib routines or Vincenty's distance formula which I already have
coded.
5. When the user clicks and starts dragging, a copy of the geometries would
be made to create a highlight to visually see the drag. When the user
releases the mouse then the actual geometry would then be transformed.

Just to ask one more time, is anyone already working on this? If not, then
I will create the tool. Does anyone have any other thoughts or suggestions?

Thanks,

Calvin

Currently I work in an organization which is very much concerned about the
quality and the structure of the file database with lots of shapefiles,
file geodatabases (ESRI), rasters. Some examples: roads, rivers, country
limits, states limits, county limits, region limits, custom regions limits,
farms limits, ...

So, nowadays we keep an ESRI Licence just to use ArcCatalog (which is what
I expected QGIS Browser to be) just to rename, preview, move stuff around
for organizing stuff around. Since there is a lot of metadata (shx, vat,
xml, ...), ArcCatalog simplifies these processes.

If QGIS Browser did support to do that kind of stuff for organizing data me
and my colleagues would be willing to migrate from ESRI ArcCatalog to QGIS
Browser. Since we are a non profit organization, it would be nice to get
off that extra load in our budgets and to use that resources in our
different projects.

The browser already was removed - if I'm not mistaken this is the first
response from someone who likes to keep it.

But it sounds like you didn't use the standalone browser yet, correct?
The browser within QGIS should also offer what you need.

​Experiments so far (with 2.18) have turned up that virtual layers don't
seem to support getProvider().minimumValue()
​which makes them unusable in Time Manger.

​Does it make sense to add these functions to virtual layers?

If so, I can go open a ticket.

You can test if reverting that commit fixes the legend.
Extent is *also* changed on zoom.
I hadn't checked if the `#if 0` block is still there, if it is
it could be easy to check.

In any case I suggest to file a ticket on hub to keep track of this.
Best if with a project showing the problem (ideally with an automated
testcase..)

Message-ID: <CAB4g1=zik343PPnSRQ5rQWCEUccook7rc1-bR7w1bNie8MB2wA@mail.gmail.com>

Symbols defined in map units resize in legend as in the map. IMHO it
shouldn't happen, symbols should have a fixed size inside the legend. The
most evident problem arise at big scales with multiple symbols, causing the
legend to grow bigger and bigger.

I haven't found any option to control this behaviour so I suppose it simply
reflects (as a side effect) the symbol redrawing for the map.

Hi all,

So the "Dissolve" tool can dissolve line features, too. I guess its
description ( *this algorithm takes a polygon vector layer and dissolve....*)
needs some fix.

BTW, is there a tool to "dissolve" point features? I mean, assuming a point
layer with features sharing the same attribute, I'd like to generate a
multi-point layer. It seems that file layers are not picked by the Dissolve
tool and I can't find another tool, except creating a pyqgis function or a
virtual layer.

Regards,
Harrissou

yes, that would generate/utilize a local Spatialite DB or Python RTree  “working area” , could be quite powerful, especially if somehow exposed as Python objects, and/or integrated with the Processing framework …

during several trainings I found that Tiled XYZ servers are difficult to

As discussed previously, adding default servers would help. I

Alternatively, could we ask QGIS users and donors whether they could

I have now added a dialog for configuration of XYZ layers - closer to
the experience with WMS and others. Also possible to edit connections
now.

Yeah - I think it would be nice to have at least OpenStreetMap tiles
available by default. Would you like to lead on asking OSM project for
permission?

That can be also an interesting option, but not sure if we have
someone who is happy to dedicate time to build and maintain our own
tileserver...

The "wms" provider name indeed may be a bit misleading - it also
supports WMTS and WMS-C in addition to WMS and XYZ. At the same time I
do not see it as a big problem if it is documented how to use it with
other protocols. If we wanted to switch to a more generic name for it,
we should probably also harmonize the input URIs that historically
expected just WMS GetCapabilities URL and only later extended to
support other protocols...

	by python
Message-ID: <9aa60a59-e771-35d3-db98-5da19f37617c@terglobo.nl>

When changing the color of a composer item using python, the 
corresponding color widget does not update to my new color.

For example, changing the label font color:

composerLabel.setFontColor(QColor(50,50,50,255))


After a redraw, the label's color in the map does change to my new 
value. But after selecting it, the widget still shows a black (#000000) 
value. How can I tell the gui to change as well? And shouldn't 
setFontColor function tell the gui to change?

Hoping anyone can help.

Hi devs,

Most of (to avoid saying "All") the QGIS algorithms have an english
description (the help panel) And I can't find those texts in Transifex,
meaning that there's no chance to have them translated (and easily
understandable for all).

Is it by design or a missing feature?

Hi all,
the first reactions from people testing QGIS 3 include a slight

Maybe adding a new default theme, with different colours etc., would
help people appreciating the many hidden changes.
I know it's cosmetic, but IMHO it would be a good marketing approach.

Hi all,
in QGIS 2.18 apparently the full path of the layer is saved in the
project, regardless whether Relative or Absolute is chosen from Project
Properties. I checked in the .qgs (ame path) and by manually moving the

which was not expected for relative).
Is this a bug, or ma I missing something?

Paolo,

Mathieu and I are working on a joint proposal for the current round of
grants, in which we will propose subcontracting an icon design studio
to remake all the icons from the main QGIS windows using a modern,
flat, monochrome (or monochrome + single color highlight) theme.

It's being partly driven by this exact scenario, and the desire to
present an immediate reflection to users that QGIS 3 represents a huge
step forward for the project.

(It's also motivated by our belief that a monochrome icon theme will
help prevent the interface from stealing attention from the
maps/composer/etc which is being worked on, and also play much nicer
with dark desktop themes)

Hi devs,

Boundless is willing to contribute Lessons plugin [0] to the QGIS
project. I have
written a QEP for this [0] and will be happy to hear your feedback.

We (Boundless) will continue with development of the Lessons plugin
regardless of the decision on this QEP. But we believe that it will be
great and useful addition to QGIS core.

Message-ID: <e6d1fafa54f4f8b912cee128d904e358@duif.net>

Hi Devs,

using:

iface.mapCanvas().setCurrentLayer(l)

in a python plugin works (as calling 'currentLayer()' returns l as 
active layer),
BUT the legend is showing that l is the currentLayer (it does not make 
the background bleu)..

I found that:

iface.legendInterface().setCurrentLayer(l)

works though.

So Question: is this a bug in the first call?
Or is that not to be used (anymore, after the legend overhaul)?

And then there is also:

iface.activeLayer() ?

Is there a difference between active and currentlayer?

If not, this is maybe a place to get a cleanup for 3.0?

Regards,

Richard Duivenvoorde

Sorry,

Should be: is NOT showing that l is now currentLayer...

The view is not updated.

Interesting, thaks for checking.
What I did:

* Project properties > Relative
  * save project
* change properties to Absolute
  * save with a different name

Result:
* content of project: full path in both cases
* moving both projects in a different folder and reopening them > layer
correctly displayed (e.g. confirmed Absolute behaviour).

All the best.

Hi

I would also like to see a nice cohesive theme designed. I have seen in the
past that you referenced LibreOffice as an example we could follow. IMHO
their theme is really bad - from both as aesthetic point of view and from a
functional point of view:

https://www.libreoffice.org/assets/Uploads/Discover/LO52-Screenshots/lo52-writer-02.png

The icons are overladen with many small details and too many discordant
colours. When I was in Singapore a year or two back, I met up with Ganesh
Shanmugam, a local QGIS service provider there. Ganesh had built a
customised version of QGIS for use in schools and showed it off to me. One
thing I really like is the way they used the same accent colour per
toolbar. For example all File icons would get e.g. a red accent, all layer
green, and so on. It makes it really easy to:

a) find a toolbar even when on a strange computer where things are arranged
differently and
b) give someone instructions : "click on the third icon from the left in
the red tinted toolbar"

In Gandesh's implementation, they actually coloured the toolbar background,
but I think it would also be nice if we rather used the accent colour (so
two-tone instead of monochrome) in the icons. Ganesh maybe you could share
a link to a screenie?

Anyway just my 2c to the debate.

Regards

Tim

I love the idea of a flat icons theme. I'm not so sure about monochrome
thought. Loosing color may mean loosing information. But, maybe the
designer can figure it out.

As always, cosmetics tend to generate lots of debate. :)

Oh - I'm not a huge fan of libreoffice's either!

Both Mathieu and I very much like the direction of this icon style:
https://www.creativefreedom.co.uk/icon-design-portfolio/application-icons/

There's a single highlight color used to disambiguate similar icons,
plus a red color used to highlight dangerous actions. I'd say this is
a good compromise - we still need to be able to easily differentiate
between "add ring" and "add part", but this highlight color could be
configurable to work with different themes (eg night mapping).

Interesting idea! My immediate thoughts are that this could detract
from the goal of "toning down" the interface, so it'd need to be done
very subtly. But it's worth exploring!

I just found a neat shortcut that's available in QtCreator - if you
right click on an old style "connect" statement, under the "refactor"
menu there's a handy "convert connect to Qt5 style" option. This does
all the hard work for you!

Hope that helps save someone else some keystrokes!

Tim,

There's an extra bonus to monochrome + highlight color icon set: it is
much, much easier for people and groups (such as Gandesh) to customize
icons to their needs. Ie, if a group wants to create an "accent colour"
icon set, it'll be much easier to do so using a monochrome set to begin
with.

Actually that's a good point... if the icon theme is monochrome + 1
configurable accent, it could be possible to have a "color grouped"
option (enabled by a plugin... because UI options are the enemy)

Map canvas and layer tree view (aka legend) are two separate widgets
which may have different "current" layers assigned. In QGIS main
window we have a mechanism that propagates current layer from layer
tree to canvas (just like it sets layers for rendering). This is a
one-way synchronization, so current layer from map canvas is not
propagated back (just like if someone changes list of layers for
rendering directly in map canvas, that will not affect checked items
in layer tree).

In theory we could have propagation of current layer from map canvas
back to layer tree view too, but it is not 1:1 relationship (e.g.
layer tree view can have a group selected rather than a layer, or
multiple items may be selected), so I am not so keen to have that in
place...

It's the same thing and yes, it is a good candidate for renaming
(together with other occurrences of 'active' instead of 'current')

Hmm... seems only possible with a silly workaround:

item.setId(old_id)

Here's the tricky bit - using 0-255 and storing as an int doesn't
translate well to displaying in a slider with values from 0-100. You
need to allow 0.1 steps in the slider to avoid loss of precision, but
then you get the confusing behaviour for users where they set the
slider to 91.2, and reopen to find it's changed to 91.3 (made up
numbers).

I'd like to avoid that, so I think in api we should always use a
double with range 0-1 for storing opacity. This can be exposed to
users on a 0-100 scale, but also converted to a 0-255 int for
rendering/etc without issue.

Hi all,

Was just chatting to Martin about this - and we both think it's time
to drop the "render" checkbox from the status bar.

This setting is a bit of a remnant from the pre-multithreaded
rendering days. Now, there shouldn't be any benefit in switching it on
---- and if there is ----- there's a bug which we need to fix!

There's not much code this saves, but it does help de-clutter the
crowded status bar.

Any objections?? Does anyone still need this checkbox?

we have done some experiment with this, and I agree it is very easy to
get inappropriate results. a tone can be useful for the reasons
mentioned, provided it is very faint.

One more issue: resistance to change is usually very high among many
users, so new icons should bear a clear relation to old ones (it should
be easy and consistent to tell how each icon has transformed). I'm not
in favour of maintaining the old set as an option for
retrocompatibility, but probably many users would be happy of this.

Thanks for the interesting discussion.

All the best.

Hmm, I'm -0 on this. I frequently use it to stop an ongoing rendering
process of large dataset(s). I realize it might be misusing that checkbox
as a stop ongoing rendering (vs. no rendering) but it's evidence it remains
useful.

That said if your open to ideas, it could go away if it's replaced by a
"stop current rendering" button. That button could actually be a spinner
logo to indicate that a rendering threat is running n clicking on it would
stop the process. That way, we could also get rid of the percentless
progress bar currently used as rendering feedback (which now looks odd next
to the task progress bar).

As a user, subtle changes to an user interface I am famiilar with
for no good reason and just for the sake of change are *incredibly
frustrating*.

An interface I was used to using is gone, and I have to learn something new.

If there is a real value-add in the interface, OK. (But even then,
it can be frustrating to learn. Acceptable, but still frustrating.)
One extreme way to put it is: I would rather the bad interface that I know
rather than a marginally better interface that I don't know. It has to
be really good to be worth the pain.


I guess we're mostly talking about color changes, rather than moving
around tools and redesigning critical UI elements, so some of these
concerns are less strong. But I think they're still concerns?

So I guess I would be more comfortable if the discussion acknowledged
these tradeoffs.

I fully understand your position, as well as the need to progress.
I think we are only talking of changing the icons, not their placement
or menu organization here (although this has been discussed previously,
and may be worth exploring).
One possible comproise (I'm sure many will object to this also) would
be, as I mentioned, to have a "legacy mode" switch so people can move to
the new icon set only when they feel comfortable with this.
All the best.

I've seen it used for projects with many very slow layers (e.g. WMS),
but this can be done grouping layers and deactivating them; moreover,
currently it has an odd behaviour (it allows zooming without
refreshing). Sometimes people unknowingly activate it, and get puzzled
by the resulting behaviour.
So +1 for me removing it.

In general, it would be useful to ask our users who is using a specific
function, and why.

All the best.

Dev's what is the proper place nowadays, to write this down somewhere?
An issue?
Github wiki?

Actually this particular one is already in the 3.0 api wishlist:

Hi,

I'm a big -1 on this.

We often use this for digitizing operations such as manual label placement.

If you have a projects which takes quite some time to render, it is very
powerful to
1. place the canvas at the proper extent
2. disable rendering
3. move all the labels needed
4. re-enable rendering for controlling

In our project, I roughly estimate that using this methodology makes the
operation 2 to 3 times faster.

Although I agree the status bar is a bit overloaded.
I would propose to:
*  remove the text and go for a checkable button
* maybe rephrase "render" to "freeze canvas", so you would need to activate
the button to stop rendering.

Sorry for that devs ;)

Denis

Yeah I'm a -1 on this at the moment.  There have been times that I have
used it even after the new rendering stuff.

Thanks Nyall! I would have never come up with a workaround like this.

Should this be fixed? Or is this "by design"? :)

Btw, the QgsComposerMap does not like this workaround, BUT also does not 
need it because the color widgets seem to get updated anyway.

Hey all,

Just note that we can ship a older icon "theme" and use the theme switcher
feature which would allow people to change back if required.

Default to the new one but ship a lagacy theme.  Have a look at Night
Mapping to see how it's done.

Isn't this an issue triggered by clearing the canvas before the next
rendering process has been finished?

If the content (per layer) would only be replaced on the screen, once
the subsequent rendering process has finished, such tasks would also be
possible without using this checkbox.

IIRC, the issue is mainly that labels come last but are removed directly.

They could be cached until a new version is available, just like any
other layer.

For extra points, only their positions would be cached and they would be
redrawn "live" with the last cached positions using a quick collision
detection algorithm.

Yeah that's one of the things I wanted to improve within MTR, but
didn't get to it yet - it would definitely make the render flag less
interesting. And the same thing could be done also for labeling - only
switch to the newly computed labeling when it is finished.

As Nyall said in the first mail, if you need to use the render flag,
then there is some problem with rendering - so knowing cases when
people still use it is very useful as we can make QGIS behave nicely
without the need for render checkbox! So please keep posting your use
cases :-)

Cheers

Hi Tim,

Apologies for the delayed response, just got access to my computer.

You got a great memory :)

Yes, it was a pilot project that we did for the ministry of education.
They wanted to teach the secondary grade students (age 16 to 18) geography
and gis with QGIS. The core requirement was to create a PORTABLE version
that they can run it on any computer. On top, since the users are students,
they wanted to make it colorful and make the interface very simple so its
easy for them to teach.. you are right on that note. Well, unfortunately,
they didn't continue with this.

Along with that, they wanted us to create a web application that will look
exactly same as the custom QGIS version and we did that too.

Most of the work was done by my colleague Serge. Will request him to post
the screens and details.

Regards,
Ganesh

​I would be -1 to do this - I think it is much better to have a consistent
message and instantly recognisable app in screenshots etc. Moving from the
1.x theme to the 2.x theme was long and painful and I think if there was a
lesson to be learned it was 'dont make multiple theme options otherwise
people will never migrate to the new one and we will end up maintaining two
themes".​

One reason to keep it: For us the use case has often been when you are
doing first set up of a project and you are dropping a bunch of large
layers yet. You want to set up scale dependent visibility and rules first
without waiting for time consuming renders, then enable rendering when
everything is added. I know we can also use the option to make layers not
visible when they are first added to the canvas so I reckon that use case
can be worked around easily enough,

One reason to remove it: I have often done training courses where a user
has randomly unchecked that and they can't figure out why nothing draws. In
a training room that is easy to fix. In 'the wild' I bet it is a source of
big frustration....

We could also have a behaviour like holding shift down when adding a layer
to the canvas makes the layer visibility turn off in the legend....though
it probably still won't help Denis' use case.....

Tim

Subject: [Qgis-developer] New feature proposal for the Dissolve tool
In-Reply-To: <CAFYjFH9woTRz1ujZM5PXh-UikqVTjpac7sMiKbp2sZj8Ws7THA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello Marco,

Note that I'm currently working on a new Algorithm that supersede 
dissolve tool.

Here is how it should look like :

Name : "Aggregate"

Parameters :

     * input vector layer

     * group_by expression (field name or complex expression, possible 
to add conditions on geometry predicates)

     * geometry aggregator : collect (multipart) or combine/union 
(single part)

     * Fields aggregators, for each field :

         aggregate function, input field, delimiter (for the concatenate 
aggregator)

         output filed definition (type, length, precision)

         with possibility to add/remove output fields, import the fields 
from an existing layer

The UI should looks like the Refactor Fields algorithm.

With this it should be possible to set a neighborhood condition in the 
group_by expression.

Cheers

Arnaud

Sorry if I'm missing something, but why is it important that in this
case nothing is rendered? I imagine you can just configure scale
dependent rendering, while ignoring that something is rendered in the
background. And once you apply the changed config, rendering will
restart with the same net-time and net-result (but less clicks).

Hi Tim,

Let me share some details about the project that you mentioned.

As Ganesh said the main challenge was to build a portable version of the
QGIS for windows. It was based on version 2.6 if I’m not mistaken. We
successfully solved that problem.

Another part of the project was simplification and stylization of the UI.
We were guided by customer requirements and introduced few ideas. Using
colour background was one such. We also tweaked few functions like bringing
the layer transparency widget to the main screen and make it permanent. We
provided a registry of predefined layers so it is easy to start working. We
aggregated functions from few third party plugins and brought buttons
directly to the main window.

Most of the icons were taken from original QGIS icon set and we introduced
few new icons for functions that we brought on the main window. Also, we
increased a size of the icons. The main goal was to customise QGIS to make
it more friendly for young students and first-time users of GIS.

In addition to customised QGIS, we developed a pilot version of Web GIS and
it was styled the same way as QGIS to make the working experience as
seamless as possible.

Please check up the screenshots here: http://geoicon.com/edugis/
screenshots/index.html

Best regards,
Serge

agree, but also when a project is already done, and is needed to tune
some properties/options (maybe not even canvas related) that triggers
useless canvas redraws.

is true, but in my training and support experience is not *that*
common. Remove this useful feature just for this reason seems an
overkill to me,

so from a user point of view, and for what it matters, -1


cheers!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Removal of the "Adding GRASS Tools" section in
	qgis.org?
Message-ID: <CAECJsSovC60JCKMK9yN8mg1PYkZsj=q7_ObuAk-CKTEFF=T0Dg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Following the discussion in [1], we plan to remove the "QGIS Developers
Guide" [2] section from the qgis.org website and emphasize it as a new
document at docs.qgis.org.

To avoid keeping wrong/unused/useless texts while moving, I would like you
to let us know if the "Adding GRASS tools" [3] section is worth keeping. Is
it up to date and of use for someone? In which case is it inline with the
other items of the QGIS Dev Guide? Or better moved somewhere else, e.g. in
the GRASS Plugin chapter [4] of User Manual or ...? Or should we simply
trash it?

Message-ID: <CANqA5a+UHhqkuF3a_0ZmGusmx0grUGrVdHkyP8OPvrWPcCN75w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Everyone:

My name is Ruoyun Jing, I am an undergraduate student in Northwest
University(China) of Software Engineering.Although i am a girl,i really
love coding !!! I've coded many alogorithm problems with C++and Python, GSoC
is really a precious chance for me to get in touch with open source
software.

After reading all the organizations and their projects, I'm pretty
interested in improving vector geoprocessing algorithms,And During last
week, I got many help from Alexander Bruy:), I have configured development
environment on Linux, And get familiar with GIS and geoprogressing
algorithms. Despite my lack of project experience,i will try my best to
learn ,code and communicate with mentor!!!

Looking forward from you.:)

Thank.

Hmm probably not so important if it is rendering nicely in a side thread and esc cancels rendering efficiently. Anyway it seems that others like Giovanni and Denis are quite invested in the feature so probably it is more useful to understand their needs as I could easily see it go and not be too worried...

Hi everyone

Today I tried to build QGIS on OSX by following the tutorial in this README
(https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/blob/master/development/README.md).
I pull the latest commit from QGIS also (sha: f0489c9fc6). But, I got this
error:

and

Does anyone have experience about this also? I have asked Tim and Etienne,

Message-ID: <CAKsfO_xHwnv+zpz+70AKSntN7t1rwnogWCJ1tr0ah4FpAsrjzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

First of all, let me introduce myself briefly: my name is Eurico Nicacio, I
am a brazilian Cartographic Engineer graduated by Military Engineering
Institute [Instituto Militar de Engenharia - IME] in 2010 and, nowadays, I
am a MSc Candidate in  Geodetic Sciences in the Geodetic Sciences
Post-Graduation Program at Federal University of Paraná [Universidade
Federal do Paraná - UFPR] with a focus in Physical Geodesy. I will receive
my MSc title up to the end of this year, and I have a 5+ years of work
experience in surveying, Python programming, GIS and field engineering.

I am also a huge open source enthusiast. I have developed some integration
tools in GIS community benefit - a standalone application and a QGIS
Plugin, both of them available at my GitHub account.

I have been talking to Alexander Bruy - through whom I got in brief contact
with Victor Olaya, Serge Rey and Anita Graser -  about my wish to
contribute with OSGeo previously, during and after GSoC 2017 since mid
January, and he has been a great helper and pre-mentor in all aspects. We
have been trying to design a GSoC project on Python initiatives for QGIS
improvement - our main idea has migrated from "General Processing
improvements" to "PySAL library integration to QGIS Processing" so far,
following a tip at the Processing paper that Anita and Victor published in
2015. I have used PySAL a couple of times and it seemed exceptional all of
the times. And as I said to Alexander, it would be a great pleasure and
honor for me having the possibility to help implementing such a important
and interesting library into QGIS Processing tool.

At this moment, we would like to share this main idea with you - PySAL
library integration to QGIS Processing - and get your contribution and
opinions on this theme. As we discussed before, it seems to have a good
relation between work/time compatibility with GSoC and positive community
impact.

I am looking forward to your feedback and suggestions. Thank you all in
advance for the support.

Best regards,

Indeed "my" use case might be solved if a better rendering process is in
place. I wouldn't mind (for my personal use case) dropping the render
option whenever it is ready. In the mean time I'm available to provide more
details if someone is willing to do these improvements :)

Hi All,


I use mapCanvas().setRenderFlag( False ) before loading a (potentially)
large number of layers using the 'Load Them All' plugin [1]. I acknowledge
I needed to toggle such flag years ago (the plugin was mainly developed in
2012) and still use it.

For another plugin (private according to requirements from a company), I
use heavy PostGIS layers in a Processing workflow. As I don't want the
canvas to show anything in the meantime (I'm only interested in getting
progress bar updates in QgsMessageBar), I use the setRenderFlag(False) and
only ask canvas to show all needed layers, including results, after all
processing is done.

Does it make sense or could I avoid toggling the flag?


Regards,

Germán

causa di un errore chiamando il metodo classFactory()" appears. Can you
help me?

I send you my project in the format .zip

Regards.

Hi Ismail,

Due to this issue:
https://github.com/qgis/homebrew-qgisdev/issues/22

You may have compilation and runtime problems, which *may* be unrelated to
QGIS source code. Until the associated Qt-based formulae are fixed upstream
at Homebrew, this will persist.

Hi Larry, Ismail,

I don't use Homebrew but still have this problem.

QGIS c4bc154 built and ran for me on macOS 10.12.3, Qt 5.8, SIP 4.19.1 
PyQt 5.8, QScintilla 2.10. The problem seems to arise from a change made 
to QgsPoint a few days ago.

My guess is that for macOS, QgsPoint needs an extra or different C++ 
library header or else a dependency on a newer compiler version has been 
introduced.

Matthias, it looks like you worked on that class most recently in 520e3c0
and 1182816. Any ideas?

Hi Michael

I tried to use this plugin (QGIS 2.18.3 Win) with point features from
a Geopackage input file.
I created two target files ("Test.gpk" and Test.shp) with attribute
"id" (Integer64) and "housenr" (String) and same CRS.
Then I started the plugin, assigned $geometry and the two attributes.
Now, whatever I choose as "add Features to..." (Geopackage, Shape,
temporary file, new File...) the log displays (in green):
> Target-Schema: id, housenr
... but no features are added. In several cases QGIS crashed with a core dump.
What am I doing wrong?

:Stefan

Hi Matthias, Larry, et al.,

Restoring the iostream header removed from qgspoint.h in 520e3c0 made my 
Mac happy.

Ok - given the widespread support for this feature we'll consider this
a "won't fix"!

Subject: [Qgis-developer] Use of autoconnect slots?
Message-ID: <CAB28Ash3EOXhvEF6xmpBv+49qiGH0k9MzCGobQicdpYp=Ti5jA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Just want to raise a discussion about this. What does everyone think
about these and whether we should be using them in code?

I'm currently leaning toward opening a QEP for blocking them in new
code. Reasons are:

- they are very fragile. Renaming a widget will break the connection
without any compilation error.
- they make searching for widget use harder. You can't use QtCreator's
handy "find usages" option (or the equivalent in other IDEs). You have
to resort to a plain text search.

I'd much prefer to see explicit connections made using new style
connects so we gain the compile time error if anything breaks the
connection.

Thoughts? Is it worth me submitting a QEP regarding this?
