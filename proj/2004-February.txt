Sorry to be slow in finishing this problem but still in the process of 
trying
to resolve the loose ends in this muddy projection.

PJ_omerc reproduces test values for the EPSG #7 example and
a variety of comparisons with GCTP.  I am satisfied that the procedure
is functioning properly.

However, resolving the documentation has not been so easy.
I am being careful that the doc math agrees with what the software
does.  The major problem is that EPSG #7 threw me off several times
and I am now fairly certain that some parts of it are wrong---even
though the example does compute.

Additional test were made with numbers for the Borneo RSO kindly
provided by Godkin.  PJ_omerc agreed within a few centimeters with
Godkin's number but the errors were random in sign and magnitude
  and indicated to me that there was a precision problem with the
computation of his values rather than an  algorithmic difference that
would have yielded more consistent deviations.

I would like to make trials with other data.

Secondly, is there a contact with EPSG that is involved with
preparing #7.  I think we should get together on this issue.

I did run into a data base supposedly from EPSG that listed proj
options for both Borneo and Malaya but while both included
azimuth "alpha" neither included the required "gamma_c."

Gerald,

I suspect this database came from me, and is just wrong, so please
disregard it.  Once RSO is supported I will rerun my generation scripts.

Gerald,

If memory serves me correctly, gamma is a function in Hotine's original
papers in "Empire Survey Review" that in actuality is "hard-coded" into the
projection equations used for Borneo and Malaya.  I'm not certain, though.

The EPSG math documentation is essentially a monograph by Mr. Roger Lott,
Retired Chief Surveyor for British Petroleum.  I believe his old company
e-mail address is still active.  It is lottrj at BP.com and this was a
near-religious pursuit for him in his later years at BP.  I am certain he
would be delighted to discuss the matter with you.  I am cc-ing him with
this so that he has a "heads up."

Peter -

Those are NOT the correct values for those coordinates projected in UTM.
Your longitude of -143 degrees isn't even close to zone 10 - it's in UTM
zone 7.  The Northing and Easting you report seem approximately correct
for the zone 7 coordinates of that point, so you should simply change
your proj command line to specify zone 7.

Hello again,

As an addendum to my last post.......

Applying the lon_0 argument instead of  'zone' gives me values but not close
to the
proper zone:

proj +proj=utm +ellps=WGS84 +lon_0=-126.0

-142.999 55.381

-383225.19      6226660.73

Actual utm for zone 10.
373382.032    6139045.069

Using -120 as the lat_0 value gives completely wrong results:
-757026.22      6320713.65

Changing the sign on the longitude has also been tested.
No good news there either.

In the case where my map crosses several UTM boundaries
and my central meridian is in zone 10, how can I project 
the edge data, which as you have noted is in zone 7, into zone 10?

Should I use tmerc instead?

Then that is what you are getting.  There is a limitation in accuracy you should be aware of when you jump several zones from true zone with a mercator projection.  It has to do with how many terms are carried out in the algorithm.  I'm not qualified to explain it, but be aware that some projections are more appropriate than others, depending on the shape and length of the area you are trying to use project into a single zone.

Peter -

If that's what you're looking for, you got the right answer.

You concluded that it was wrong because you compared it to the zone 7
northing and easting, not the pseudo-zone 10 values.

While you can mathematically do what you're intending, you will get
severe distortion in your data.  Using "tmerc instead" won't help - UTM
is simply a particular form of tmerc, and using tmerc for such a large
extent will produce a comparable degree of distortion.

Depending on your application, that distortion might be acceptable.  The
reason UTM zones are 6 degrees wide is based on a desire to limit the
extent of that distortion.

Working on this projection is a lot like that other solo activity that 
makes
one go blind.

It FINALLY sank in that the so called gamma_c in the skewed versions is
really just gamma_0 computed from alpha_c.  Similarly, alpha_c can be
obtained if only gamma_c is given.

To summarize: in the Alaska zone only alpha_c is given and the u,v grid
is rotated by alpha at lonc,lat_0 with x,y aligned with N,S at the 
center
point and in the RSO versions the grid is rotated at lonc,lat_0 by
gamma_0 with x,y aligned with N,S at the aposphere equator.

The nice thing about this is that you *do not* need to know values for 
both
alpha_c *and* gamma_c.  One only need to tell the projection
which angle to use in the rotation.

NOW the question I am going to drop in y'all laps is how do you
want proj and PJ_omerc to handle these options???

Right now PJ_omerc handles Alaska #1 the old fashion way
with merely specifying +alpha=.

I am not sure whether alpha_c or gamma_o is the defining
specification in RSO.  EPSG does not recognize the relationship
with the two so is no help.  The barely readable documentation on
Malaya RSO seems to indicate that gamma_0 is the primary
specification.

Should I set it up that +alpha= exclusive or +gamma_0= be the
options?  (Drop gamma_c all together)

Should I allow for arbitrary rotation with +gamma_c?

Note: +no_rot flag option is still available which omits any
rotation--offset and thus the user can roll his own.

BTW:    sin(gamma_0) = sin(alpha_c) / D
where D is a function of only latitude_c and eccentricity.  Thus you
can see how they are tied together.
What kept me going around in circles was that EPSG report kept
using another variable gamma_c that was user specified.(?!)

PROJ.4 will transform between geographic and cartesian coordinate
systems but *you* must know what kind of map transformations are
involved in you pixel maps.  Knowing the projection details (like
projection type, and control factors the remaining problem is knowing
scaling and rotation needed to convert from PROJ.4 cartesian system
to that of your pixel map.  Also you need to be sure that PROJ.4 
supports
both forward *and* inverse projection modes for the particular 
projection
type your pixel map is using.

come out reasonably cloase to what is expected.
I'll have to modify my code to change the UTM zone at each
boundary I guess.
	I also need to check my original method for generating UTM since
one of the two methods gives me about 9 meters of error near the center of
the zone. Of course this may be due to a lack of ellipsoid in *my* original
model.

I did notice that mapping outside the UTM zone with proj has a greater
error to the east. I'm not sure whay that is. Perhaps the polynomial equation
that is being used iterates from west to east.

Thanks again for your input.

An additional insight on the Hotine.

Axis rotation point may also vary.  In Alaska and Borneo the point of
axis rotation is at the map's central point (lonc, phi_0).  In the case
of the Malayan system, rotation looks to be at the aposphere
equator and lambda_0.

Thus it appears that I need to reestablish the +no_uoff option of
the old PJ_omerc---Malaya was apparently the reason it was there.
I believe I will change the name of the option because the uoff
part is not that clear without reading the math.

I presume nobody in this group is using it nor even aware of it
presence.  :-)

Hello,

proj4 only converts coordinates from one projection (coordinate system) to 
another. It's not clear what you are trying to accomplish by highlighting 
cities. I don't think proj4 is the tool you want for that.

If you want to plot your city locations on a map use GMT from the 
University of Hawaii. This will allow you to plot your city *vectors*
over your regional map.

Peter

Message-ID: <1076354499.12130.12.camel@alexanders.isacson.dyndns.info>

Hello list.

I'm looking for a way to transform coordinates (WGS-84 lat, long) from a
GPS receiver to RT-90 (N/E) which is local grid here in Sweden. I'm
really new to all this and I'm just realizing that these transformations
are allot harder than I thought. Hopefully PROJ.4 can help me out.

To go form WGS-84 to RT-90 one has to preform the seven-parameter
translation. http://www.geocities.com/mapref/prj/se/se.html

How do I preform this transformation? Can it be done with cs2cs? Is
there a +fromwgs84 parameter?

If someone could provide me with the exact commandline to preform this
translations I'd be forever grateful.

Regards

I found a 7-parameter transformation at this website:
http://crs.ifag.de/country_select.php?country=SE

The following command line gives OK results but they are some 10-15cm out
from the test point at
http://www.geocities.com/mapref/prj/se/se_rt90simp.html and I don't know
what's causing that. You should maybe try with some other software to
verify proj.4's result. The problem may simply be the small error
resulting from treating SWEREF93 and WGS84 as the same thing (they are
close enough for many purposes).

Complaining about 10-15 cm is NOT a cartographic problem.

At that level of precision, you are talking geodesy.

PROJ4 is not designed or intended for geodetic results with a 7-parameter
transformation for a national solution.

The Kingdom of Sweden has a series of software packages for their country
that yields excellent geodetic results.  I suggest that you use their very
special software for high accuracy results if that's what you need.  A
7-parameter datum shift (either the Bursa-Wolf or the Molodensky models)
will yield decimeter results for a area about the size of a United States
county, certainly NOT the entire country of Sweden.

PROJ4 is for cartographers doing cartography and remote sensing with GIS
tools.

Thank you for your quick reply.

I have two further questions:
  My GPS reciver outputs degrees and not degrees, minutes, seconds. Can
cs2cs handle that? Can I just do "echo 58.39693 15.51353 | cs2cs ...."?

The accuracy of 10-15 centimeters is good enough for my application. It
won't be used for navigation just orientation and displayed on a screen.
Do I need to adjust the parameters if I want the best accuracy to be
around Norrköping (about 58d30m30s 16d10m)

Thanks again.

Regards

Alexander,

PROJ commandline utilities accept DMS angles that look like this:

120d1'31.122"W  27d5'23.59"N

Hi 

I have two questions:

1) I would like to convert  coordinates from UK National Grid to lat/long. 
>From the proj manual and ordinance survey information, I calculate the input 
projection definition to be:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=49n +lon_0=2w +k=0.9996012717 +ellps=airy +a=677563.396

How would I specify that I want the output coordinates to be in lat/long using 
proj on the command line.?

2) Is there a simple 'hello world' c++ example that demonstrates the libproj 
programmatic interface, as I need to do the above process programmatically.

I am woking on suse linux 9.0

Many Thanks

Tim,

The proj command always converts between the projected coordinate system you
specify, and lat/long coordinates on the same ellipsoid.   So, no need to
specify anything special.

Note, I tried your formulation which duplicates the ellipsoid information
between the +ellps and the +a/+b and got:

warmerda at gdal2200[40]% proj +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49n +lon_0=2w +k=0.9996012717 +ellps=airy +a=677563.396 +b=6356256.910
Rel. 4.4.7, 31 March 2003
<proj>:
projection initialization failure
cause: squared eccentricity < 0
program abnormally terminated

With just the following things seem to work fine:
warmerda at gdal2200[41]% proj +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49n +lon_0=2w +k=0.9996012717 +ellps=airy

By default proj converts from lat/long values to projected coordinates.  To go
from projected coordinates to lat/long supply the -I (inverse) parameter.

I would add that your coordinate system definition is lacking the false easting
and north required for the British National Grid.  If we use EPSG code 27700
(OSGB 1936 / British National Grid) we get:

warmerda at gdal2200[44]% proj -v +init=epsg:27700
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +init=epsg:27700 +proj=tmerc +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-2 +k=0.999601 +x_0=400000
# +y_0=-100000 +ellps=airy +units=m +no_defs

> 2) Is there a simple 'hello world' c++ example that demonstrates the libproj 
> programmatic interface, as I need to do the above process programmatically.
> 
> I am woking on suse linux 9.0

The proj_init() man page includes the following simple "old style API"
example for going from lat/long to projected coordinates.

        #include <proj_api.h>

        main(int argc, char **argv) {
             char *args[] = { "proj=merc", "ellps=clrk66", "lat_ts=33" };
             projUV p;
             projPJ pj;

             if (!(pj = pj_init(3, args)))
                exit(1);
             while (scanf("%lf %lf", &p.v, &p.u) == 2) {
                p.u *= DEG_TO_RAD;
                p.v *= DEG_TO_RAD;
                p = pj_fwd(p, pj);
                printf("%.2f\t%.2f\n", p.u, p.v);
             }
             exit(0);
        }

To go the other way, use pj_inv() instead of pj_fwd() and apply the RAD_TO_DEG
translation to the result after pj_inv() instead of the reverse before.  The
angles accepted and produced by the API entry points are always in radians.

Best regards,

Hi Frank

Many thanks for your detailed and informative reply! I managed to get my 
command line conversion working using the invproj tool. We were just manually 
adjusting coordinates for UK grid false easting and northing, though using 
the epsg:27700 approach seems a more flexible approach.

Thank you very much also for the code snippet - that should get my on my way!

Best Regards

Tim Sutton

While doing the finishing tests for PJ_omerc I looked into the EPSG_v65
data base for some info, especially for Malaya.  Spent the weekend 
learning
perl, installed the db into MySQL and everything looked rosy in spite of
weak EPSG documentation.

My question to anyone familiar with this relational data base is how to 
link
an ellipsoid to a projection given a place name like Malaya?  I can 
easily
find the projection associated with the area but no link to the 
ellipsoid
tables.  Similarly, I can go into the coordinate reference system table
but links to datum code or ellipsoid are NULL.

What I would like to do, and this seems reasonable, is key in an area
name, do a REGEXP search of char field in appropriate table and come
up with a list of ellipsoids used in that area and a list of grid 
cartographic projections.
For datum shifters, that information should be available also with the 
same
basic search method.  That's probably too naïve an expectation.

These problems are the same for Borneo as well.

It is a nifty way to handle information on non-ellipsoid projection 
parameters
and would seem like a useful method to use with a proj parameter DB.

Comments appreciated, including guffaws.

Gerald,

There remains the problem of associating datums with these lovely vacation
spots.  Each datum has a specific set of Grids that are correct for that
datum.  For some countries, various mathematical variations for a given
projection or Grid are dependant on particular datum date spans.
Furthermore, the EPSG "database" while extensive, is rift with errors.  The
relations and parameters for Western Europe are good.  As one gets further
and further from Western Europe, the number of errors, misunderstandings,
goofy interpretations, and outright garbage increases.

In its form as a cartographic transformation tool, PROJ4 seems to do an
excellent job.  I would strongly urge you not to contaminate it with the
EPSG stuff.

First of all, I would not contaminate PROJ.4 with any data base
system (other than what it already has with ellipsoid references, etc.).
I was only looking for a convenient relational data base system
as a source for proj parameters.  Everything so far is pretty much
been the flat file approach.

I also understand the hassles related with ellipsoids and datum
specs but it would seem like simpler cases such as Alaska
Zone 1 for NAD83 and NAD27 ought to cough up the ellipsoid.

Yes, I agree that there are errors within the system.  I have found
one code that points nowhere but does seem to contain a projection
code.

The system did cough up the projection parameters for Malaysia
sans the ellipsoid which I can read from an old fax.

After working with the well constructed USDA Nutritional data base I
assumed something better than what I got.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] cs2cs and prime meridian
Message-ID: <20040225174154.GH18458@thuille.itc.it>

Dear list members,

I would like to report a strange (for me) observation in 'cs2cs'.
Trying to reproject from Gauss-Boaga to LatLong, I obtain somehow
odd results:

1) Gauss-Boaga/Fuso 1 (Ovest) to LatLong:

cs2cs -v +init="epsg:26591" \
      +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +init=epsg:26591 +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=21.45233333333333 +k=0.999600
# +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl +pm=rome +units=m +no_defs
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
1660469 5101082 100
23d31'34.538"E  46d2'37.045"N 100.000

   This result is wrong.


2) Specifying the parameters manually without prime meridian:

cs2cs -v +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 \
   +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs \
   +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
# +units=m +no_defs
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
1660469 5101082 100
11d4'26.138"E   46d2'37.045"N 100.000

   This result is correct (at least close to be correct).

3) Specifying the parameters manually *with* prime meridian:

cs2cs -v +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 \
   +ellps=intl +units=m +pm=rome +no_defs \
   +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
# +units=m +pm=rome +no_defs
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
1660469 5101082 100
11d4'26.138"E   46d2'37.045"N 100.000
 
4) Specifying the parameters manually with *wrong* prime meridian:
cs2cs -v +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 \
   +ellps=intl +units=m +pm=ferro +no_defs \
   +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
# +units=m +pm=ferro +no_defs
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
1660469 5101082 100
11d4'26.138"E   46d2'37.045"N 100.000

   Same results with +pm=ferro and +pm=rome, strange.

5) Test again, using nonsense +pm value:

cs2cs -v +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0
+ellps=intl +units=m +pm="99.999" +no_defs    +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.999600 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
# +units=m +pm=99.999 +no_defs
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
1660469 5101082 100
11d4'26.138"E   46d2'37.045"N 100.000

To me this indicates that all specifications of the prime meridian in
the epsg file are ignored by 'cs2cs'. Since some month ago, when the 
lon_0 values were adapted to introduce the concept of prime meridian,
all calculations based on these epsg entries are wrong (tested only 'rome'
pm).

Number of potentially affected definitions:
grep '+pm=' /usr/local/share/proj/epsg | wc -l
     66

Please tell me that I am wrong (where's the trick?).
Sorry, if this was a stupid observation, but I don't manage
to use 'cs2cs' any more for Gauss-Boaga.

Otherwise, should I file a bug report?

Hi there!


I have the following paramters(custom datum):

major semiaxis +a=6378388
Flattening     +es=0.00336700336700273

Shift          dX=-87
               dY=-98
               dZ=-121

and i try to convert lat/long coordinates to utm coordinates.

I was trying to convert with cs2cs program:

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=utm +a=6378388
+es=0.00336700336700273 +zone=33 +towgs84=-87,-98,-121

and as input i use

13d57'10.9"E 46d05'55.3"N
and as result i received

419076.12   5107361.73

But i shuld receive:
419071      5105641

I read lat/lon coordinates on ellipsoid with same parameters:

major semiaxis +a=6378388
Flattening     +es=0.00336700336700273

Shift          dX=-87
               dY=-98
               dZ=-121


Could enyone help me please. I'm loosing my mind with this problem.
Thanks in advance!

Hi!

If i include paramter +towgs84 in proj.exe
ther is no efect. Why??


proj +proj=utm +ellps=intl +towgs=100,200,300 +zone=33

Thanks,Igor

Igor,

I did a few quick checks, and it appears that the steps in the process
(ellipsoid conversion and datum shifting) are both being applied.  Are
you sure your expected results represent what this transformation is
supposed to do?  Note that 3 parameter datum shifts are typically not very
good approximations of datum differences over large areas.

I guess my main point is that I can't isolate any obvious problems in the
calculations being done by cs2cs.

Igor,

The proj program specifically converts between a projection and the
lat/long coordinates on the same ellipsoid.  It ignores any "auxilary"
information like datum or prime meridian.  So the +towgs84 information is
not significant since it never attempts to convert to/from wgs84.

As I presume you have since discovered, the cs2cs program is more appropriate
for conversion between arbitrary coordinates systems.
