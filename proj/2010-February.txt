Subject: [Proj] C#/.NET wrapper updated...
Message-ID: <4B669683.95FD.00E4.0@dfg.ca.gov>

I made a few changes to the .Net wrapper for PROJ.4 that I wrote several
years ago.

*  Fix for functions returning strings (pj_get_def, etc).  Default
marshalling could/would cause an access violation.
*  Remove all "unsafe" code.
*  Implement IDisposable interface for the Projection class.

Thanks to Stefan Löhr for bringing the string handling bug to my
attention.

Everyone,

>From the FAQ "Changing Ellipsoid / Why can't I convert from WGS84
to Google Earch /Virtual Globe Mercator?" it says to add

+nadgrids=@null to "trick proj.4 into applying no change to
the lat/long values when going to WGS84".

How is that different than +towgs84=0,0,0?

Thanks,

Aaron,

When you use +towgs84=0,0,0 PROJ.4 still converts from the source
ellipsoid to geocentric coordinates, applies the offset and then
transforms from geocentric coordinates to the wgs84 ellipsoid.  That is,
a +towgs84=0,0,0 results in simple conversion of ellipsoid via geocentric
coordinates which still applies a large offset when the ellipsoids are
quite different.

+nadgrids=@null tricks PROJ.4 into skipping all that.

Best regards,

Hello I am entering recently in the list, greetings to the colleagues.  

The process of migration of our space databases and applications GIS to platforms of Free Software, implies in occasions the necessity to repair in aspects that in the software proprietors, they were we quite transparent. The case that occupies me is a palpable example of what I comment them.    
The situation is the following one. I am from Cuba and our CRS in the EPSG they are the following ones: 3795: North Cuba, 3796: South Cuba, both for the work with plane coordinates, and the 4267 NAD27, for the case of the geographical ones. The CRS 4267 are the base for the CRS 3795 and 3796 and he has as DATUM the "Nad 27 Continental for US." 
  
In the case of the operations of CONVERSION OF COORDINATED: of 3795 at 3796 or 3796 at 4267 (in this case of plane to geographical) we achieve extremely precise results in the conversion, but it is not the case, when we carry out operations of TRANSFORMATION that imply the step the transformation of a DATUM to other, for example:  of NAD27 to WGS84.   
The problem is related, with the fact that the specific Datum doesn't exist for the area of Cuba and the local CRS they are inheriting the parameters of transformation of another region. The problem begins him to perceive when superimposing space layers as: GPS or Images of Goolgle (both in WGS84), have more than enough layers in local CRS.  

To exemplify the actions that we have carried out, we take like case of study the function Postgis:  ST_Transform and we carry out consultations like these, for the transformation tests. Select Astext(ST_Transform(ST_SetSRID ('point(-76.670120 20.388508) ':: geometry, 4267),4326));  
Previously we carry out the creation of a New SRID (4267001) in the chart: spatial_ref_sys of Postgis, with: proj4txt:  "+proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +towgs84=2.478, 149.752, 197.726, -0.526356, -0.497970, 0.500831, 0.685238 +no_defs ".   

As you it can appreciate, we eliminate the parameter +datum=NAD27, and we incorporate those (7) transformation parameters to WGS84 of our country for the method of Bursa-Wolfe. For what we have studied on the topic, we lack the treatment of the parameter +nadgrids, that which we have not been able to implement, because we lack information on the form of configuring an appropriate grill to our territory. In the Database of EPSG, the CRS 4267, they have registered the Variant: 88, the one which this associated to the transformation parameters to WGS84, before exposed, but we have not been able to give to this a practical sense that facilitates us to work with a NAD 27 for Cuba, as we had it in Mapinfo, for example:  "Longitude / Latitude (NAD 27 for Cuba_CNGPS) ", 1, 9999, 7, 2.478, 149.752, 197.726, -0.526356, -0.497970, 0.500831, 0.685238, 0  

So that they can help us, I include a group of test data:  
Point1 in NAD27 for Cuba    
Long: -76º 38' 28.0824" or in DD: -76.64100612    
Lat: 20º 22' 16.19" or in DD:  20.371090164    
Point1 in having Transformed correctly to WGS84  
Long: -76º 38' 27.171" or in DD: -76.6408814349  
Lat: 20º 22' 18.192" or in DD:  20.37172032737  
  
Point in plane coordinates "South Cuba" 3796  
X: 520065.10m Y:190891.5m  
  
When carrying out the transformation operations in postgis (with the parameters before mentioned), we obtained the following erroneous results:  
Point1 become to WGS84 with postgis DD:  
Long: -76.6406516  
Lat: 20.3718218  
Transformed Point1 of WGS84 to South Cuba 3796 (plane coordinates):  
X: 520043.06m Y:190910.53m  

It is evident the great difference between the prospective results and those really reached ones.  
Excuse the extensive of the mail, but I didn't have another form of trying to make me to understand and to treat such a complicated problem.  
I request them collaboration, in the solution of this situation, their ideas will be of an useful helps for us.

Hello,
it seems you want to use the datum shift 
   
    EPSG:15978, "NAD27 to WGS 84 (88)",

which has Area of Use = Cuba. (See http://www.epsg-registry.org ) 

When you write 

    +towgs84=2.478, 149.752, 197.726, -0.526356, -0.497970, 0.500831, 0.685238

you have the same numerical values as EPSG, but you have more decimals.

However, there are two opposite sign conventions for the 
three rotations, known as the Position Vector Transform 
and the Coordinate Frame Rotation.  

According to EPSG, "NAD27 to WGS 84 (88)" is 
published as a Coordinate Frame Rotation. But PROJ.4 
uses the opposite convention, so you must reverse the
signs of the rotations.  So, you get 

    +towgs84=2.478, 149.752, 197.726, 0.526356, 0.497970, -0.500831, 0.685238

instead.

I tried this with cs2cs, but I still got an error 
of 15.6 meters compared to your test point:

C:\Program Files\FWTools2.2.8>cs2cs +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +towgs84=2.478,149.752,197.726,0.526356,0.497970,-0.500831,0.685238 +no_defs +to +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84
-76.64100612 20.371090164
76d38'26.713"W  20d22'17.928"N -22.240

(Error calculated on http://williams.best.vwh.net/gccalc.htm )

With your version, you got an error of 29.1 meters. 
So my answer is not the complete answer, since EPSG 
says the accuracy of the datum shift is 1 meter.  
(Even if this is the standard deviation (one sigma), 
I would not expect greater errors than 3 meters.)

Maybe your test point is wrong, or maybe the datum
shift is wrong. The EPSG information source for the
datum shift is 

   "Dictamen 2/05 de la Oficina Nacional de Hidrografia y Geodesia".

Hello colleague,  
I am glad their prompt and well documented answer a lot.   
The key in the solution of the problem resided in the investment of the rotation signs, according to PROJ.4.  
Colleague you were right, with the investment signs, the transformation problem should be resolved, and otherwise, the test point was with errors.  
Because I explain to him, I made a copy and paste error (the classic error) when determining the coordinates in decimal grades, in the seconds, I change 3600 for 3660 and undoubtedly the copy and paste multiplied the error for four.  
The real values are:  
Coord in Local 		DD Coord in DD WGS84    
Lat 20.371163889 		20.371637480    
Long -76.641134000 		-76.640881435  
  
And then, magic, colleague the transformation is carried out correctly.  
Thank you and excuse the nuisances, I am pending of the list.

Why?

Single parallel specification is allowed---along with k_0.

Subject: [Proj] Standard projection for Mediterranean basin
Message-ID: <4B76E159.8010709@infinito.it>

Hello,

I use PROJ.4 via GRASS GIS, and I would like to know if anyone is aware 
of a standard projection for mapping the whole Mediterranean basin. I 
need to do raster-based statistics on the maps, so I guess what I am 
looking for is an equal area projection.

What I have found on the Web is a GIS built by the Joint Research Center 
(JRC http://www.jrc.ec.europa.eu/) that used Lambert Azimuthal Equal 
Area (LAEA) for the Mediterranean:
http://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvgis/info/faq.htm#projection

However, it adopted the same projection center for both Europe and the 
Mediterranean (0 °E and 48 °N). Is this correct?

There is also a workshop report
http://www.ec-gis.org/sdi/publist/pdfs/annoni-etal2003eur.pdf

that recommended LAEA with projection center 9 °E and 53 °N to be used 
for statistical mapping in the European Union.

Based on this background it seems like LAEA would be fine. However, I am 
unsure if there is a standard projection center and datum.

Thank you for any hints. Kind regards,

Luigi

Personal opinion: because you seem to have your own project needs that has not 
shown a need to match any existing projection I would, because of the general 
E-W shape of your region, select Albers Equal Area conic. With reasonably 
selected parallels is should give you less distortion at the extremities than 
the azimuthal projection.

A little parameter tuning needs to be done.

I would not be prejudiced by projections where the needs to cover the entire 
continent are are the primary consideration.

/usr/share/proj/espg's EPSG:2177 does not define a datum so no datum
transform is applied.

EPSG:2175 is defined Poland zone 5, EPSG:2177 is Poland CS2000 zone 6, 
it is not true,
when I add datum or +towgs84 then it will be true.

I am not an expert, I was surprised error.
Please help in determining the value datum or towgs84.

 From what you say, I understand that it would basically be a matter of

I had the inference that the request was for an equal-area projection---a mode

Hi,

I am using Noaa-15 to 19 data quite a lot in my work and as polar satellites
they would benefit a lot from space oblique mercator projection.

I see that the landsat projection is available, and I wondered if it was
feasible to adapt it to fit the noaa trajectories ? Although I don’t think they
return on the same orbit as landsat did...

Thanks,
Martin

Hi,

I seems the "geos" projection does not support a lat_0 argument. Although it is
clear that geostationnary satellites are not suppose to have lat_0 different
than 0, in practice it happens.

Is there a way to take this fact into account ?

I had the inference that the request was for an equal-area projection---a mode
that I consider preferable for thematic purposes.

Perhaps, except that the software would likely have to be modified to add this 
step while Albers is already available with no software mod..

Also, below the CM is located at the eastern end of the Mediterranean (29E) 
between Crete and Cyprus. This does not seem suitable for an extent ranging 
from Gibraltar (6W) to Lebanon (36E).

Could you explain the relationship between Authalic Latitude and Equal 
Area projections? There is an article by John Snyder at 
http://www.jstor.org/stable/2562645?seq=1, but it's a bit above my 
mathematical head.

Hello,
I have written some code in order to use PROJ.4 from GNU Octave
(www.octave.org). I've made a GNU Octave package and I've uploaded it
to Octave forge:

I hope that is helpful to someone

I wonder if it could be merged with the octave mapping toolbox?
That toolbox is quite short of features right now, but is already
an official debian package.

it surely will be!

ps- check out the m_map toolbox from UBC. currently only for
Matlab AFAIK, and no substitute for e.g. GMT, but quite nice if
you find yourself having to do cartography-in-matlab.

I do not understand Dr. Mugnier's response. Using the authalic latitude does not yield an equal-area projection if you project using a conformal projection. I cannot think of any use for mixing authalic latitude with conformal projection.

The purpose of the authalic latitude is to provide an equal-area projection of the ellipsoid onto the sphere. From there you may project to the plane using any spherical equal-area projection, yielding an equal-area projection of the ellipsoid onto the plane. While this technique will not preserve other properties of the spherical projection (such as standard parallels or constant scale along some meridian or somesuch), at least it drastically increases the available projections for ellipsoidal use.

I have, by the way, formulæ somewhere that I derived for computing the optimal standard parallels for Albers given the north/south extents of the map. I will post them if I happen to find them. The 1/6th rule would be fine for any real use, of course. The optimal is more of academic interest.

Agreed.  
 
My point was the gentleman originally was looking for appropriate "standard" parameters for the Mediterranean region.  The old WWII Grid has such parameters albeit for a conformal projection.  Adopting a spherical projection of choice, the old parameters give a "standard" treatment for the region.  Whether it's Albers Equal Area, Lambert Equal Area, or whatever, the primary question regarding choice of parameters was answered.
 
Since the purpose was to choose (presumably "standard" conic) parameters for a region, the choice of a False Origin is immaterial, including where one chooses a central meridian.  
 
If someone has an even older set of "standard" parameters for the Mediterranean region, have at it.  Betcha it's conic or close to it like a Bonne.  Anybody want Napoleon's parameters ???  I think I published it in one of my old columns on the Levant.
 
I believe the horse might finally be dead.

	Could you explain the relationship between Authalic Latitude and Equal Area projections? There is an article by John Snyder athttp://www.jstor.org/stable/2562645?seq=1, but it's a bit above my mathematical head.

What's the 1/6 rule, Daan, and how much does it deviate from the optimal 
formula?

BTW Nice Java applet to study projection deformations here:

http://www.uff.br/mapprojections/Albers_en.html

Pity they didn't make it possible to alter projection parameters like 
standard parallels.

No it isn't. I'm working with maps from the Napoleonic period, in many 
cases the oldest topographical maps we have. All information about their 
projections is welcome, especially regarding ellipsoids.

Jan & colleagues:

Regarding the question of optimal standard parallels for Albers, I found my notes from 8 years ago. To summarize, there is no good rule, so perhaps the exact calculation I describe below has more importance than just academic.

Regards,
— daan Strebe

________________________


The problem: given two latitudinal extents phi[N] and phi[S], find the optimal standard parallels for the Albers projection. Optimal is defined to mean that the maximum angular deformation between the two standard parallels equals the maximum angular deformation at the two latitudinal extents. In this way one is assured that the maximum deviation from true remains minimal throughout the region of interest.

In a breathtakingly brief treatment, Melluish touches on the issue by describing how to select standard parallels such that the "error" on the extreme parallels is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the error of the central parallel. The distortion measurement is equivalent to mine, but the central parallel (the average of the north and south extreme parallels) generally does not carry the greatest distortion, so his method does not yield an optimal map. Hinks discusses the problem precisely, even noting that the central parallel is not the parallel of greatest distortion... but his treatment applies to the equidistant conic, not the equal-area, contrary to Snyder's comment in USGS P.P 1395.

We define a family of Albers projections to be all Albers projections characterized by a common 'central' latitude at which angular deformation reaches a peak between the two standard parallels, or sinks to zero in the case of one standard parallel. I have placed 'central' between quote marks because it is not any simple average of the standard parallels. We can demonstrate that the ratio of the angular deformation of any two points on the map remains constant for every member of the family. This is the beautiful and useful characteristic of the family. The property arises out of a happy mathematical coincidence.

First I declare the member of the family with only one standard parallel to be the canonical form. Because of the family's property of invariant scale ratios, we can first reduce the problem of choosing an optimal Albers projection to the single standard parallel case, which is much more tractable than trying to deal with two free parameters. This gives us a projection with zero distortion along the canonical parallel and identical distortion at the northern and southern extremities. Once we have found the canonical projection, we can choose the member of its family that produces the same magnitude of distortion at the canonical parallel as at the extreme parallels. We are guaranteed that the projection that fulfills this condition is one from the family of the canonical projection.

Let phi[S] denote the southern parallel of interest; phi[N] the northern parallel of interest; phi[0] the canonical parallel; phi[1] a standard parallel; and phi[2] the other standard parallel.

phi[S] and phi[N] are given. From them we must determine phi[0], phi[1], and phi[2], such that the magnitude of the angular deformation at phi[0] is the same as the magnitude of the angular deformation at phi[N] and phi[S]. Furthermore, there must be no greater angular deformation registered anywhere between the phi[S] and phi[N]. Given those conditions:

1) sin (phi[0]) = A +/- sqrt (A^2 - 1)

where

2) A = (sin (phi[N]) * cos^2 (phi[S]) - sin (phi[S]) * cos^2 (phi[N])) / (cos^2 (phi[S] - cos^2 (phi[N]))

That establishes the canonical parallel of the canonical form, and therefore the family, wherein lies the solution.

If we arbitrarily select some phi[1], one may ask how to arrive at the correct phi[2] within the family, given phi[0].

3) sin (phi[2]) = [sin (phi[1]) - 2 sin (phi[N]) + sin (phi[1]) sin^2 (phi[N])] / [2 sin (phi[N]) * sin (phi[1]) - sin^2 (phi[N]) - 1]

However, we do not yet know the proper phi[1]. With much manipulation, we discover the iterative equation:

4) cos^2 (phi[1]) * sqrt (1 + sin^2 (phi[0]) - 2 sin (phi[0]) * sin (phi[S])) - cos (phi[S]) (1 + sin^2 (phi[0] - 2 sin (phi[0]) sin (phi[1]) = 0

We solve for phi[1] with (4) and then use (3) to compute phi[2]. Now have the optimal Albers for any circumstance.

The literature fixates quite a bit on rules of thumb for choosing the standard parallels, with some texts recommending inward 1/5th the meridional separation of the extreme parallels. Other texts recommend 1/7th, and yet others recommend 1/6th. My own calculations based on the above criteria show that the correct values range from 5% to 25% for reasonable conics, and the symmetry between north and south is not necessarily very good. Hence, no rule of thumb is very good. The higher the latitude of the northern parallel, the greater the asymmetry. The asymmetry remains remarkable even if both latitudes are high. For instance, extreme latitudes at 50° and 70° result in standard parallels placed optimally at roughly 10% below phi[N] and 18% above phi[S].

Deetz's and Adams's recommendation of 29°30' and 45°30' for the US are pretty good, of course. Given maximum extents of 24°34' and 49°25', the optimal standard parallels are 28°42' and 46°19'. If we just can't bring ourselves to treat Lake of the Woods equitably then the upper standard parallel drops to 45°56'. The lower parallel only drops by 5'. The former map yield a maximum east-west scale distortion of 1.19%; the latter yields 1.15% (excluding Lake of the Woods, of course). Deetz's and Adams's recommendation yields 0.98% in the heartland; 1.25% at the northern border; 1.45% at the northern tip of the Lake of the Woods boundary; and 1.37% at Key West.

I do not understand Dr. Mugnier's response. Using the authalic latitude does not yield an equal-area projection if you project using a conformal projection. I cannot think of any use for mixing authalic latitude with conformal projection.

The purpose of the authalic latitude is to provide an equal-area projection of the ellipsoid onto the sphere. From there you may project to the plane using any spherical equal-area projection, yielding an equal-area projection of the ellipsoid onto the plane. While this technique will not preserve other properties of the spherical projection (such as standard parallels or constant scale along some meridian or somesuch), at least it drastically increases the available projections for ellipsoidal use.

I have, by the way, formulæ somewhere that I derived for computing the optimal standard parallels for Albers given the north/south extents of the map. I will post them if I happen to find them. The 1/6th rule would be fine for any real use, of course. The optimal is more of academic interest.

Another possibility perhaps: Near-sided perspective projection (nsper).
This one has a lat_0.

Thanks ! That looks to be what I was looking for.

Do you have a programmatic version of the algorithm? It's something that 
would be really useful for a global map provider. I am working with the 
Royal Tropical Institute here in Amsterdam (www.kit.nl), on an index for 
their 10.000s of historical maps from all over the globe. In the long 
run we would like to offer  some thematic functionality, with an optimal 
projection, of course

I have been looking through the definition with proj4, as well as

something called "Portuguese Modified Grid - Datum 73". I have a
description for it, but I do not think it is complete:

Anyone familiar with this?

Very interesting!
But, could you please balance the parentheses in equation 4 (and 3), because 
equation 4 cannot be calculated.

Jan & colleagues:

Regarding the question of optimal standard parallels for Albers, I found my 
notes from 8 years ago. To summarize, there is no good rule, so perhaps the 
exact calculation I describe below has more importance than just academic.

Regards,
— daan Strebe

.....

3) sin (phi[2]) = [sin (phi[1]) - 2 sin (phi[N]) + sin (phi[1]) sin^2 
(phi[N])] / [2 sin (phi[N]) * sin (phi[1]) - sin^2 (phi[N]) - 1]

However, we do not yet know the proper phi[1]. With much manipulation, we 
discover the iterative equation:

4) cos^2 (phi[1]) * sqrt (1 + sin^2 (phi[0]) - 2 sin (phi[0]) * sin 
(phi[S])) - cos (phi[S]) (1 + sin^2 (phi[0] - 2 sin (phi[0]) sin (phi[1]) = 
0

We solve for phi[1] with (4) and then use (3) to compute phi[2]. Now have 
the optimal Albers for any circumstance.

Looks like what I have. I translate that into this:

+proj=utm +lat_0=39.66825833333333 +lon_0=-8.133108333333334 +k=1 +x_0=180.598 +y_0=86.990 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs


It is the utm of which I am uncertain.

Dunno, but doesn't the utm projection uses a couple of preset values for 
lat_0, k_0, x_0, y_0, and a calculated value of lon_0?
The tmerc projection seems more appropriate.

You are surely correct. I will give this on a shot:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66825833333333 +lon_0=-8.133108333333334 +k=1 +x_0=180.598 +y_0=86.990 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs

Too bad it is always so hard to get appropriate test data for
verification.

Hello

The proj string you refer is not correct. What is called in the EPSG
database "Portuguese Modified Grid - Datum 73" (epsg code 27492) is
the projection used in Portugal for the local datum called Datum 73.
Datum 73 was established in 1973 and is based on the Hayford
ellipsoid.
The correct definition of the projection can be found in the epsg file
distributed with proj:

# Datum 73 / Modified Portuguese Grid (deprecated)
<27492> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=39d00' +lon_0=-8.131906111111112 +k=1
+x_0=180.598 +y_0=-86.98999999999999 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs  <>

It is a Transverse Mercator projection with central point:
    lat_0=39d00'00.000"N
    lon_0= 8d07'54.862"W
No scale factor in central meridian is applied (+k_0=1)
It has a small false easting/northing
    x_0=180.598
    y_0=-86.990

This coordinate system was replaced by a new projection based on datum
ETRS89. The new projection, that the Portuguese Geographic Institute
(IGP) called PT-TM06, has a different central point. It's correct
definition is:

# ETRS89 / Portugal TM06
<3763> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66825833333333 +lon_0=-8.133108333333334
+k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs  <>

In your proj string you had this central point mixed with the Datum 73
projection.

For a test point you can use the following (a geodetic point called Cabreira):

D73 Geographic - epsg:4274     (8d02'39.1243"W 41d38'17.2443"N)
D73 projected  - epsg:27492    (7488.375 218847.838)
ETRS89 Geographic - epsg:4258  (8d02'35.8302"W 41d38'20.2812"N)
ETRS89 Projected  - epsg:3763  (7483.752 218845.648)

To convert from Datum 73 to ETRS89 a Bursa-Wolf transformation can be
used. Using program cs2cs you can have, for example:

cs2cs +init=epsg:27492
+towgs84=-230.994,102.591,25.199,0.633,-0.239,0.900,1.950 +to
+init=epsg:4258 +towgs84=0,0,0

These parameters are given by IGP
(http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/Geodesia/Inf_tecnica/parametros_transformacao/parametros_Portugal.htm).

I have created NTv2 grid files to convert from datum 73 (and other
older national systems) to ETRS89 with better accuracy. They are
available in my page: http://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/jagoncal/coordenadas
(sorry, only in Portuguese).

Hello

The proj string you refer is not correct. What is called in the EPSG
database "Portuguese Modified Grid - Datum 73" (epsg code 27492) is
the projection used in Portugal for the local datum called Datum 73.
Datum 73 was established in 1973 and is based on the Hayford
ellipsoid.
The correct definition of the projection can be found in the epsg file
distributed with proj:

# Datum 73 / Modified Portuguese Grid (deprecated)
<27492> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=39d00' +lon_0=-8.131906111111112 +k=1
+x_0=180.598 +y_0=-86.98999999999999 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs  <>

It is a Transverse Mercator projection with central point:
    lat_0=39d00'00.000"N
    lon_0= 8d07'54.862"W
No scale factor in central meridian is applied (+k_0=1)
It has a small false easting/northing
    x_0=180.598
    y_0=-86.990

This coordinate system was replaced by a new projection based on datum
ETRS89. The new projection, that the Portuguese Geographic Institute
(IGP) called PT-TM06, has a different central point. It's correct
definition is:

# ETRS89 / Portugal TM06
<3763> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66825833333333 +lon_0=-8.133108333333334
+k=1 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs  <>

In your proj string you had this central point mixed with the Datum 73
projection.

For a test point you can use the following (a geodetic point called Cabreira):

D73 Geographic - epsg:4274     (8d02'39.1243"W 41d38'17.2443"N)
D73 projected  - epsg:27492    (7488.375 218847.838)
ETRS89 Geographic - epsg:4258  (8d02'35.8302"W 41d38'20.2812"N)
ETRS89 Projected  - epsg:3763  (7483.752 218845.648)

To convert from Datum 73 to ETRS89 a Bursa-Wolf transformation can be
used. Using program cs2cs you can have, for example:

cs2cs +init=epsg:27492
+towgs84=-230.994,102.591,25.199,0.633,-0.239,0.900,1.950 +to
+init=epsg:4258 +towgs84=0,0,0

These parameters are given by IGP
(http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/Geodesia/Inf_tecnica/parametros_transformacao/parametros_Portugal.htm).

I have created NTv2 grid files to convert from datum 73 (and other
older national systems) to ETRS89 with better accuracy. They are
available in my page: http://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/jagoncal/coordenadas
(sorry, only in Portuguese).

I have no program code (that I can find or recall), though I found the Maple V worksheet I constructed at the time, and from which I made the corrections noted below. I also found tables I calculated giving optimal standard parallels for pairs of bounding parallels.

Eek. Yes. Correcting, and using more uniform notation:

1) sin (phi[0]) = A +/- sqrt (A^2 - 1)
2) A = [sin (phi[N]) * cos^2 (phi[S]) - sin (phi[S]) * cos^2 (phi[N])] /
    [cos^2 (phi[S]) - cos^2 (phi[N])]
3) sin (phi[2]) = [sin (phi[1]) - 2 * sin (phi[0]) + sin (phi[1]) * sin^2 (phi[0])] /
    [2 * sin (phi[0]) * sin (phi[1]) - sin^2 (phi[0]) - 1]
4) cos^2 (phi[1]) * sqrt [1 + sin^2 (phi[0]) - 2 * sin (phi[0]) * sin (phi[S])] -
 cos (phi[S]) * [1 + sin^2 (phi[0]) - 2 * sin (phi[0]) * sin (phi[1])] = 0

Equation (4) is of the form

5) a * cos^2 (phi[1]) + b * sin (phi[1]) + c = 0

which has a closed-form solution, though it is a little messy. There

a = sqrt [1 + sin^2 (phi[0]) - 2 * sin (phi[0]) * sin (phi[S])]
b = 2 * cos (phi[S]) * sin (phi[0])
c = - cos (phi[S]) - cos (phi[S]) * sin^2 (phi[0])

with solution

6) phi[1] = Atan2 (-[a*x^2 + c]/b], x)

where

7) x = +/- sqrt (-4*a*c - 2*b^2 +/- 2*z) / (2*a)

and

8) z = sqrt (4*a*b^2*c + b^4 + 4*a^2*b^2)

The sign for (1) is chosen as the opposite of the average of the signs of the northern and southern bounding parallels. Using all combinations of signs in (7) yields four solutions. The two that are between phiS and phiN are the two of interest. (3) becomes superfluous in this scenario, since it yields the same as one of the combinations. I have supplied a few examples below. rn is the inset of the northern standard parallel as a ratio of the latitudinal span of the region of interest; rs is the southern.

phi[S] = 20 phi[2] = 46.34188   rn = 0.12192

Jan & colleagues:

Regarding the question of optimal standard parallels for Albers, I found my notes from 8 years ago. To summarize, there is no good rule, so perhaps the exact calculation I describe below has more importance than just academic.

________________________


The problem: given two latitudinal extents phi[N] and phi[S], find the optimal standard parallels for the Albers projection. Optimal is defined to mean that the maximum angular deformation between the two standard parallels equals the maximum angular deformation at the two latitudinal extents. In this way one is assured that the maximum deviation from true remains minimal throughout the region of interest.

In a breathtakingly brief treatment, Melluish touches on the issue by describing how to select standard parallels such that the "error" on the extreme parallels is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the error of the central parallel. The distortion measurement is equivalent to mine, but the central parallel (the average of the north and south extreme parallels) generally does not carry the greatest distortion, so his method does not yield an optimal map. Hinks discusses the problem precisely, even noting that the central parallel is not the parallel of greatest distortion... but his treatment applies to the equidistant conic, not the equal-area, contrary to Snyder's comment in USGS P.P 1395.

We define a family of Albers projections to be all Albers projections characterized by a common 'central' latitude at which angular deformation reaches a peak between the two standard parallels, or sinks to zero in the case of one standard parallel. I have placed 'central' between quote marks because it is not any simple average of the standard parallels. We can demonstrate that the ratio of the angular deformation of any two points on the map remains constant for every member of the family. This is the beautiful and useful characteristic of the family. The property arises out of a happy mathematical coincidence.

First I declare the member of the family with only one standard parallel to be the canonical form. Because of the family's property of invariant scale ratios, we can first reduce the problem of choosing an optimal Albers projection to the single standard parallel case, which is much more tractable than trying to deal with two free parameters. This gives us a projection with zero distortion along the canonical parallel and identical distortion at the northern and southern extremities. Once we have found the canonical projection, we can choose the member of its family that produces the same magnitude of distortion at the canonical parallel as at the extreme parallels. We are guaranteed that the projection that fulfills this condition is one from the family of the canonical projection.

Let phi[S] denote the southern parallel of interest; phi[N] the northern parallel of interest; phi[0] the canonical parallel; phi[1] a standard parallel; and phi[2] the other standard parallel.

phi[S] and phi[N] are given. From them we must determine phi[0], phi[1], and phi[2], such that the magnitude of the angular deformation at phi[0] is the same as the magnitude of the angular deformation at phi[N] and phi[S]. Furthermore, there must be no greater angular deformation registered anywhere between the phi[S] and phi[N]. Given those conditions:

1) sin (phi[0]) = A +/- sqrt (A^2 - 1)

where

2) A = (sin (phi[N]) * cos^2 (phi[S]) - sin (phi[S]) * cos^2 (phi[N])) / (cos^2 (phi[S] - cos^2 (phi[N]))

That establishes the canonical parallel of the canonical form, and therefore the family, wherein lies the solution.

If we arbitrarily select some phi[1], one may ask how to arrive at the correct phi[2] within the family, given phi[0].

3) sin (phi[2]) = [sin (phi[1]) - 2 sin (phi[N]) + sin (phi[1]) sin^2 (phi[N])] / [2 sin (phi[N]) * sin (phi[1]) - sin^2 (phi[N]) - 1]

However, we do not yet know the proper phi[1]. With much manipulation, we discover the iterative equation:

4) cos^2 (phi[1]) * sqrt (1 + sin^2 (phi[0]) - 2 sin (phi[0]) * sin (phi[S])) - cos (phi[S]) (1 + sin^2 (phi[0] - 2 sin (phi[0]) sin (phi[1]) = 0

We solve for phi[1] with (4) and then use (3) to compute phi[2]. Now have the optimal Albers for any circumstance.

The literature fixates quite a bit on rules of thumb for choosing the standard parallels, with some texts recommending inward 1/5th the meridional separation of the extreme parallels. Other texts recommend 1/7th, and yet others recommend 1/6th. My own calculations based on the above criteria show that the correct values range from 5% to 25% for reasonable conics, and the symmetry between north and south is not necessarily very good. Hence, no rule of thumb is very good. The higher the latitude of the northern parallel, the greater the asymmetry. The asymmetry remains remarkable even if both latitudes are high. For instance, extreme latitudes at 50° and 70° result in standard parallels placed optimally at roughly 10% below phi[N] and 18% above phi[S].

Deetz's and Adams's recommendation of 29°30' and 45°30' for the US are pretty good, of course. Given maximum extents of 24°34' and 49°25', the optimal standard parallels are 28°42' and 46°19'. If we just can't bring ourselves to treat Lake of the Woods equitably then the upper standard parallel drops to 45°56'. The lower parallel only drops by 5'. The former map yield a maximum east-west scale distortion of 1.19%; the latter yields 1.15% (excluding Lake of the Woods, of course). Deetz's and Adams's recommendation yields 0.98% in the heartland; 1.25% at the northern border; 1.45% at the northern tip of the Lake of the Woods boundary; and 1.37% at Key West.

I am confused about the lat_0 term. All references for this say that
this is 39º 40’ 00’’ N. Also, in the files I have with proj, it is
defined as:

<27492> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=39.66666666666666 +lon_0=-8.131906111111112

+no_defs  no_defs <>

Is it standard to use 39º 00’ 00’’ N instead? The people I am doing this
for have referenced
http://www.igeo.pt/produtos/Geodesia/inf_tecnica/sistemas_referencia/Datum_73.htm

(Note: the reason I missed this entry in proj at the start and asked the
original question was that I looked for "Portugal" in the file. I never
thought to look for "Portuguese".)

Hello

Sorry, it was my mistake: it is in fact 39d40'. I edited the value in
the epsg file, to convert decimal degrees to DMS, and made the
mistake... The epsg file is ok.

Some history about that projection: that central point was chosen at a
mid latitude of the country and 1d00'00"E of the Lisbon Meridian
(9d07'54.862"W). The small false easting/northing of a few hundred
meters, which is quite unusual, was chosen in order to create
projected coordinates similar to projected coordinates in an older
datum (datum Lisboa).

I suspected the false values were for some such thing.

And I am glad about the 39d40'. Otherwise I would really have been
confused.

Thanks all for the help.

Hi Frank,

I note that Carl has submitted a ticket (Ticket #62 (new enhancement)) to
request for the gamma_c parameter in the omerc code. Please advise if this
patch is already available because I would like to test if it will work for
the Borneo RSO Coordinates.

Below are some examples (lat & longs are in everest(borneo) ellipsoid)

Noteworthy is the article:
An equal area projection for statistical mapping in the EU, Lysandros 
Tsoulos.
To be found in the collection:
Map projections for Europe, Institute for Environment and Sustainability, 
2001.
See page 50 f.f.
The author proposes a map projection for the whole of Europe with reasonably 
low distortions.
Albers and LAEA are considered. The distortions at the boundaries of the EU 
are lower with a LAEA than with an Albers projection.

By the way, do you have a similar algorithm for optimal parallels for the 
LAEA projection?

Alex,

Thanks for the poke, I have went through the steps to integrate Gerald's
updated omerc implementation and the results look good.  I have not yet
modifying the epsg init file, nor it's generation mechanisms to handle
the new gamma parameter.  Some details in:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/62

How do I make a proj4 EPSG projection that works???

Oscar:

Presumably "LAEA" = Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection, in which case it has no standard parallels. The question would be where to center it. That's an easier problem to solve in the typical case than Albers; you simply find the small circle that circumscribes the area of interest. That small circle's center coincides with the center of the optimal Lamber azimuthal equal-area for the region.

In the article I was referring to, the angular deformation and the scale 
error of the Albers and the LAEA projections are compared for the whole of 
the European Union. The Albers has two standard parallels at 38 and 61 d N, 
with a CM at 9 E. The LAEA has its center at 9 E and 53 N.
I got the impression that the author just shifted the LAEA center up and 
down by trial and error until a reasonable comparison could be made with the 
Albers.
I wondered, could the center of the LAEA projection have been determined 
algorithmically?
Still an academic discussion, of course......

Oscar:

>From the publication you cited (http://www.ec-gis.org/sdi/publist/pdfs/annoni-etal2003eur.pdf):

"A simple but useful way of appraising the location of the origin of an azimuthal projection is to plot a series of concentric circles of radii z representing the isograms of maximum Angular Deformation and those of Scale Error at the scale of a convenient atlas map and to shift this overlay about on the map until a good fit is obtained between some of the extreme points of the area of mapped."

While phrased in an unnecessarily complicated way, the recommendation in "Map Projections for Europe" is the equivalent of my recommendation. You have a bunch of points you know are within the area of interest. Whether manually (as described in that publication) or programmatically, you need to find the smallest small circle that circumscribes them all. I don't know of any non-iterative method for doing that, though possibly one could be devised. As an algorithmic process, it is not difficult, but unlike Albers, it is not just a matter of observing the most northerly and most southerly points.

I note that you talk about comparing Albers to LAEA. Once you know the optimal LAEA you can do that, since the distortion values at the extremes of the region of interest can be computed by known formulæ once the parameters for the projection are known.

Can I interpret your inquiry to mean that you want to know (presumably in complete detail) the algorithm for finding the projection center of the optimal LAEA for a region, given a list of points in that region? Or are you just wondering if one could be devised?

For me, I certainly would be interested in the algorithm.

Like I said, that was my impression indeed.

An iterative procedure can always be devised, but I just wondered if there
was (or someone knew of) a closed form.

An interesting point are emotions. Just a hypothesis: try to sell LAEA to an
American client and Albers to a European client. Probably the other way
around works better, whether projection A or B is mathematically better /
more efficient or not.
Such a factor cannot be put into an algorithm!
Are there many examples of US maps in LAEA and Euro maps in Albers?

Nope. Just wondered if you happened to have a quick closed form solution.

Thanks for all the consideration you've given this question so far!

Colleagues:

I have updated the mapthematics.com site with a new, greatly expanded gallery of small-scale map projections. Each page describes a projection and gives a sample map in color and a bivariate distortion diagram. Please enjoy.

Subject: [Proj] +axis switch to control axis orientation
Message-ID: <4B8B4691.7060305@pobox.com>

Folks,

As part of an effort to support the transverse mercator south orientated
based coordinate systems as well as a few other coordinate systems with
unusual axis orientations I have tentatively introduced support for a new
+axis parameter for coordinate systems in PROJ.4 (the OSGeo version).

The +axis switch takes three character arguments defining the axis
orientation of the coordinate system.  The possible values are:

'e' - easting
'w' - westing - an x/longitude with the opposite sign to normal.
'n' - northing
's' - southing - a y/latitude with the opposite sign to the normal.
'u' - up - normal z
'd' - down - a z/elevation with the opposite sign to the normal.

So, a normal coordinate system is defined as "+axis=enu".  This is the
default and it may be omitted in the normal case.  Some variations:

"end" - Normal in x/y but the Z is a depth rather elevation.
"neu" - reversed x/y axes, for instance +proj=latlong +axis=neu would truely
         be a latitude/longitude coordinate system.
"wsu" - A coordinate system with the sign of x and y negated as is used
         for transverse mercator south orientated.

I have committed preliminary support for this switch in PROJ.4 trunk.  I
should note that the axis switching is done on entrance to pj_transform()
and (in reverse) on exit.  So applications, like proj, that call pj_fwd()
and pj_inv() directly will ignore the axis orientation just as they ignore
the prime meridians, and datum shifts.   However, programs that do use
pj_transform() - like cs2cs - will utilize the axis orientation switches.

eg.
cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 \
   +to \
        +proj=tmerc +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +k_0=1 +lon_0=31 +lat_0=0 \
                    +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +axis=wsu
30.5 -29.5
48483.46        3264793.45 0.00

Though this is already in trunk, I am seeking feedback from the community
on the approach.  Whether it seems sufficiently general for other possible
uses, and whether the naming seems reasonable.

I should note that anyone who feels that non-projection coordinate system
services (like datum shifts, etc) do not belong in PROJ.4 need not feel
obligated to make that point again in reference to +axis.  It can be assumed
to apply.

If there is no widespread outcry against this functionality, I will
document it properly and make modifications to the mechanisms for
generating the epsg init file to take advantage of it.

Best regards,
