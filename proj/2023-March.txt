Subject: [PROJ] Problems with EPSG:1236 - (AGD84 to WGS 84 (2))
Message-ID: <CAE49LKx23GL15yvXSK5UU0_JLNbJmW=bquuRMHKWmtsoPp8zCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I?m developing a transformation api using PROJ9 and pyproj. We?ve done a
broad test of different transformations, and we have some issues which I?m
not able to understand.

Going from AGD to WGS 84, I find 5 available transformations in the
"coordinate_operation_view" in proj.db internal database:
EPSG:15785, AGD84 to WGS 84 (9)
EPSG:1236, AGD84 to WGS 84 (2)
EPSG:1109, AGD84 to WGS 84 (1)
EPSG:1669, AGD84 to WGS 84 (7)
EPSG:15789, AGD84 to WGS 84 (8)

Asking for the available transformations using 'projinfo -s EPSG:4203 -t
EPSG:4326 -o PROJ --spatial-test intersects' i get only 4:
DERIVED_FROM(EPSG):15785, AGD84 to WGS 84 (9), 2.9 m, Australia -
Queensland, South Australia, Western Australia, federal areas offshore west
of 129?E.
EPSG:1669, AGD84 to WGS 84 (7), 3.0 m, Australia - Queensland, South
Australia, Western Australia, federal areas offshore west of 129?E.
EPSG:1109, AGD84 to WGS 84 (1), 4.0 m, Australia - Queensland, South
Australia, Western Australia, federal areas offshore west of 129?E.
EPSG:15789, AGD84 to WGS 84 (8), 5.0 m, Australia - Queensland, South
Australia, Western Australia, federal areas offshore west of 129?E.

EPSG:1236, AGD84 to WGS 84 (2) is missing. This has an accuracy of  5, same
as EPSG:15789.

We use  transformer.TransformerGroup to fetch the available transformations
in our code, and I get the same results even If l set minimum accuracy to 5
or 10.
I?ve also tried to set the AreaOfInterest to the transformation Extent, but
still the same result.

Question 1:
Is this to be considered as a bug, or is it a logical explanation? I have a
couple of more similar examples.

Question 2:
On the other side, I am able to get the pipeline going from 4203 to 4326
(AGD84 to WGS 84 (2)). by using:
Transformer.from_pipeline(f"urn:ogc:def:coordinateOperation:EPSG::1236")

As the API I develop delivers transformation pipelines in both directions,
where coordinates are not always given(optional), It's easy to get the
pipeline in both directions using TransformerGroup.

I am considering using the urn definition + Transformer.from_pipeline
instead, but struggle to find a way to get the reverse pipeline (from
EPSG:4326 to EPSG:4203 (EPSG:1236)).
Someone who can help on how this can be done?

Thanks and regards,
Torill Kj?snes Gabrielsen

You'll get it with the --show-superseded flag of projinfo:

projinfo -s AGD84 -t "WGS 84" --summary --spatial-test intersects 
--show-superseded

The supersession is recorded in the supersession table of proj.db and 
also shows in the remark of EPSG:1236

PROJ itself has a proj_coordoperation_create_inverse() method, but it 
doesn't seem to be used by pyproj. Something to potentially raise to 
https://github.com/pyproj4/pyproj

Subject: [PROJ] Auxiliary latitudes, rhumb lines
Message-ID: <5d7519fb-5d4f-c5f4-cdf6-c8bac6f824d0@karney.com>

Two papers which may be of interest to PROJ users are available as
preprints:

   C. F. F. Karney
   On auxiliary latitudes (Dec. 2022)
   https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05818

   C. F. F. Karney
   The area of rhumb polygons (Mar. 2023)
   https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03219

The first is of more immediate interest in the PROJ context...  A case
could be made that all the conversions between auxiliary latitudes in
PROJ should be centralized and should support both series approximations
(fast and applicable to small flattening) and exact methods (slower and
applicable to arbitrary eccentricity).

I would single out the current treatment of authalic latitude in area
preserving projections as most in need of some loving case.  These all
end up determining the authalic latitude by taking the arc sine of the
value returned by pj_qsfn (normalized).  This results in a severe loss
of accuracy near the poles.

The second paper implements solutions to rhumb problems in terms of
auxiliary latitudes.  This could be used to provide an ellipsoid
generalization of the loximuthal projection (but I'm not sure whether
this is a pressing need).

Note that I'm careful to use the subjunctive mood here (should, would,
...).  I don't have the time to undertake the suggested changes to PROJ
myself; but I would be happy to guide someone else (perhaps these are
suitable student projects?).

Charles,

I did an implementation of your work on auxiliary latitudes for use in
Rust Geodesy (https://crates.io/crates/geodesy).

I found your work exceptionally clearly written and very easy to
transform into code.

My implementation is primarily in these four files:

https://github.com/busstoptaktik/geodesy/blob/main/src/ellipsoid/latitudes.rs
https://github.com/busstoptaktik/geodesy/blob/main/src/ellipsoid/constants.rs
https://github.com/busstoptaktik/geodesy/blob/main/src/math/mod.rs
https://github.com/busstoptaktik/geodesy/blob/main/src/inner_op/latitude.rs

The first 3 comprise the implementation per se, while the fourth is an
implementation of a generic coordinate operator (think proj=latitude...),

The manual for the operator is at
https://github.com/busstoptaktik/geodesy/blob/main/ruminations/002-rumination.md#operator-latitude

Rust Geodesy is, if anyone should be interested, a tiny
transformation system, intended as a platform for
architectural and conceptual experiments,
potentially as inspiration for future developments of PROJ.

The system EPSG:31467 is defined in the db as northing easing.
But I get strange results if I use WKT1 on cs2cs

Hi Javier,

> Is that normal?

yes, WKT1_GDAL emulates the behaviour of the GDAL <= 2.4 era. In 
particular GDAL <= 2.4 by default didn't include the AXIS[] definitions, 
so when importing from such WKT, easting/northing order is assumed.

Note: GDAL 2.4 supported the EPSGA (A for AXIS) pseudo authority, so 
when resolving EPSGA:31467, it outputed a WKT1 with AXIS[]. But I didn't 
try to emulate that rather esoteric behaviour in the PROJ 6 rewrite.

Bottom line: only use WKT1_GDAL for legacy purposes, understanding that 
there are a number of potential stumbling points in doing so.

 code
Message-ID: <186e158b2ef.128053f992568495.2791380176809508392@neacsu.net>

Hello,



I think I may have found a small error in the above mentioned projection (file ocea.cpp). The error can be directly traced to Snyder and the numerical example he gives for the spherical form of this projection.



In his numerical example (page 279, formula for x) Synder has the following derivations:

0.98X arctan [-0.6223338/(-0.9720102)l

= 0.98X(0.5694937 + rr), adding .rr since denominator is negative.



In ocea.cpp (line 29) this translates into the following code:

if (t < 0.)

??????? xy.x += M_PI;



I believe that Synder should have subtracted M_PI as the numerator of the atan fraction is negative (see Snyder page ix discussion about ATAN2 function) and consequently ocea projection should also use atan2.



I have to admit I'm writing this with a certain trepidation as reporting an error in Snyder is almost like finding faults in the Bible, but I'd like to have this clarified.



The error is probably insignificant and I ran into it only because I'm working on an online version of the Snyder book. You can check it at https://neacsu.net/docs/geodesy/snyder/ Currently I'm transcribing the numerical examples to JS and MathJax and that's how I ran into this issue.



Thank you for looking into it.

Hello, good afternoon,

My name is Joan Montolio Llenas, and I would like to share with you a
little doubt concerning an inverse transformation of coordinates that I
want to perform from "Lambert Conformal Conical" (y,x) coordinates to
(lat,lon) ones.

I am using the "pyproj.Proj()" function to define the features of the "lcc"
projection. The features of the "lcc" projection that I am considering are
these:

lat_0 : reference latitude of the projection
lon_0 : reference longitude of the projection
latC : latitude of domain center
lonC: longitude of domain center

The problem that I have is that I can't specify "lon_0" as a parameter in
the "pyproj.Proj()" function. Note that my "lon_0" does not have the same
meaning as the "lon_0" appearing as a parameter in the function. The first
represents the "reference longitude of the projection" and the latter is
the "longitude of projection center" (which is my "lonC").

To better understand my situation, I send you the link to a web page (
https://hirlam.github.io/nwptools/domain.html) where you can visualize the
domain of the "lcc" projection that I am considering. I send you in this
image the configuration of my "lcc" projection:
https://pasteboard.co/h9QXQnKCkFag.png

Note that "lon_0" and "LonC" take different values.

I was wondering if there is some way to specify the longitude of reference
within the "pyproj.Proj()" function. I would be glad if you could give me a
hand with this issue.

Thanks in advance.

Regards,

Joan

Mircea,

could you file an issue at https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/ about that ? 
It would help if you could provide evidence that a change is needed: 
like wrongly transformed coordinates (possibly with a screenshot of a 
reprojected map before and after your fix) or that the current forward 
formula doesn't roundtrip with the inverse formula before your fix, but 
does after, etc.

I see in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commit/5cad2f68f2a68c8c6854d0bfc62700299598dfa1 
that I already did a atan() -> atan2() change in another equation (9-8) 
of ocea, so maybe equation (10-4) also needs it.

Message-ID: <AM0P192MB0482E5CC15C4621FDEA861B4EFBC9@AM0P192MB0482.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Hi PROJ mailing list,

I am making a Geodetic TIFF Grid for the transformation between ETRS89 and Lowest Astronomical Tide of the Netherlands (https://epsg.org/crs_9289/ETRS89-LAT-NL-depth.html).

So this Geodetic TIFF Grid is of the type "VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL". The description "geoid_undulation" seems unfitting, but if I choose something else like "lowest_astronomical_tide" PROJ doesn't accept it:
proj_create: Error 1029 (File not found or invalid): pipeline: Pipeline: Bad step definition: proj=vgridshift (File not found or invalid)
cct: Bad transformation arguments - (File not found or invalid)
    'cct -h' for help
Should I use the description "geoid_undulation" nevertheless, should I use something else for type instead of "VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL", or should I make a feature request to support a description name for "hydroid" models?


Another, thing I was wondering is how to deal with the difference between height and depth. Should the Geodetic TIFF Grid specify ETRS89 + LAT NL depth (EPSG:9289) as target CRS, so EPSG would only have to make transformation code and a tif equivalent of the transformation method "Geog3D to Geog2D+Depth (txt)" (https://epsg.org/coord-operation-method_1115/Geog3D-to-Geog2D-Depth-txt.html)? Or should the Geodetic TIFF Grid specify ETRS89 + LAT NL height (for which no EPSG code is available yet) as target CRS? I case of the latter, EPSG would need to make transformation code and an equivalent of the transformation method "Geog3D to Geog2D+GravityRelatedHeight (txt)" (https://epsg.org/coord-operation-method_1098/Geog3D-to-Geog2D-GravityRelatedHeight-txt.html), but also have to add an additional CRS code for LAT NL height, a Compound code ETRS89 + LAT NL height, and a transformation code LAT NL height to LAT NL depth based on "Height Depth Reversal" (https://epsg.org/coord-operation-method_1068/Height-Depth-Reversal.html).

Coincidentally I am working on a similar grid for Denmark. I?ve used VERTICAL_OFFSET_VERTICAL_TO_VERTICAL, which seems to fit the bill.

Cf https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/issues/2739, 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/3010 and 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data/pull/76 for a similar case for Norway

Using VERTICAL_OFFSET_VERTICAL_TO_VERTICAL / vertical_offset isn't super 
appropriate as this is intented for VerticalCRS to VerticalCRS but I see 
that's what was used in the Norway case. PROJ isn't super pedantic about 
that and just checks that geoid_undulation or vertical_offset are found 
in the band description. Looking at the beloved GGXF draft 
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Gridded-Geodetic-data-eXchange-Format/master/specification/GGXF%20v1-0%20OGC-22-051r2_2023-01-09.pdf), 
they have distinguished geoid and hydroid cases with a "hydroidHeight" 
parameter, but ultimately the maths are the same. We could potential 
extend PROJ to accept hydroidHeight as a valid band description name.

That should be sufficient. That's what is used for the Norway case (for 
the 'Geographic3D to Depth (Gravsoft)' method)

The documentation (https://proj.org/specifications/geodetictiffgrids.html) indicates that VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL should be used in case of 3D geographic input. And if one doesn?t read the documentation, but like me just runs the script (https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ-data/blob/master/grid_tools/vertoffset_grid_to_gtiff.py) to convert a .gtx grid to a .tif grid then one is not even aware there is a ?geoid_undulation? description in the .tif grid. And if one finds this description (e.g. with gdalinfo), one might conclude that ?geoid_undulation? is used loosely just like in EPSG, where all Geog3D-to-GravityRelatedHeight and Geog3D-to-Geog2D-GravityRelatedHeight methods mention:
?Geoid model is used loosely in the parameter name. If the offset is between the ellipsoid and the geoid then the offset will be the geoid separation N. When the offset is between the ellipsoid and a realisation of the geoid through a vertical datum then the offsets C will form a height correction surface. A height correction surface differs from a geoid model by small amounts due to the difference between the geoid and the actual datum surface as well as some other assumptions regarding the gravity field.?

To prevent users to make different choices in similar use cases, the documentation should indicate what to do for Lowest Astronomical Tide (LAT) or other Chart Datum grids.

ER wrote:

That would make things more clear too. Would that apply to VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL as well as VERTICAL_OFFSET_VERTICAL_TO_VERTICAL then?


I am still a bit in doubt now what to do. Should I use VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL which seems more appropriate, or should I use VERTICAL_OFFSET_VERTICAL_TO_VERTICAL to prevent a situation where LAT / Chart Datum grids of different countries use a different choice?

Another question is if it is a good idea to add a Geodetic TIFF Grid for the transformation between the national levelling height system NAP and LAT of the Netherlands to EPSG? And should we add that instead of the ETRS89 ? LAT transformation, or should we publish both in EPSG to shorten the number of transformation steps in PROJ?

(https://epsg.org/coord-operation-method_1115/Geog3D-to-Geog2D-Depth-txt.html<https://secure-web.cisco.com/1C0OGwbcSQayRKLMfTRpLb-EtR-PXOfProPA5vmhahSALbHJyreYBWZw_A36ZeSCiFwipwL8Ei4dd4poCrz-_ESacDyeG2lBpKkq72Yw-1oLUjf09O2WjX8FLim91QmPvSrB3ytqzVJ-UCdr5obZuxUnvR3DWNhhP27YZESiqmIZK6iYoFYWO7OhL6WLf_GT5heq1zxD_8mvrtFuiuVvhM36mhQviBCqGbz0MalLL4zgzcsML1cnTbAfFaurP94v01F0YFA8ZnYt1XhwmCBg02LkqoXJ77xCpKtQFs5JZNRuderEYbfDXy5zwoTq8PYTNjZszmwh9R3dVOcZ5gNRaYQ/https%3A%2F%2Fepsg.org%2Fcoord-operation-method_1115%2FGeog3D-to-Geog2D-Depth-txt.html>)?

That should be sufficient. That's what is used for the Norway case (for the 'Geographic3D to Depth (Gravsoft)' method)

It is really up to you, the use cases you want to solve and also 
depending on if EPSG has a policy regarding this.? PROJ can 
automatically chain 2 GeogCRS->VertCRS transformation where the GeogCRS 
is the same (e.g doing EGM96 -> EGM2008, and I believe it can also chain 
a GeogCRS->VertCRS and VertCRS->VertCRS with a pivot common VertCRS. 
That said explicit concatenated transformations in the registry can help it.

Thanks! This means that the Geodetic TIFF Grid for Chart Datum of Norway (and possibly also the one of Denmark that Kristian Evers is working on) wrongly use type VERTICAL_OFFSET_VERTICAL_TO_VERTICAL instead of VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL. But as that works too, it?s not a big deal.



I have two questions:

  *   Are you sure about the tag ?hydroid_height?? A Google search (https://www.google.com/search?q=%22hydroid+height%22) gives only 1 relevant hit. I have no opinion on this, as it is not my expertise. I?m just helping the people at our hydrographic service.
  *   Why limit the description to only predefined options? I can imagine that one could want to use a reference surface that is not a geoid nor a hydroid, for example an ellipsoidal DTM grid to transform to/from Above Ground Level heights. So it might be easier to allow any description to prevent future problems.



I will probably use type VERTICAL_OFFSET_GEOGRAPHIC_TO_VERTICAL with a new description (e.g. hydroid_height) for the tif grid. But I?ll also make a gtx grid for users of PROJ versions that don?t accept the new description. I might use the gtx grid for application in EPSG for that reason. That might be easier anyway, since there are not yet tif grids in EPSG as far as I know.

This is borrowed from the GGXF draft 
(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opengeospatial/CRS-Gridded-Geodetic-data-eXchange-Format/master/specification/GGXF%20v1-0%20OGC-22-051r2_2023-01-09.pdf). 
I assume they are right, as they are much smarter people than me. They 
have a slightly different naming convention "hydroidHeight" which I 
modified to match our convention.

Well, no, we must have a predefined and limited list. Otherwise PROJ 
grid interpolation code, when inspecting a GeoTIFF dataset, will not 
know in which channel to find the information.

Are the newer versions updated but I am not able to find them? Or is

Thanks.

Thanks Even.

I understand that AXIS tag is not supported in some WKT1 standards (well,
that is what "I understand" reading WKT2 standard).
However,
 projinfo EPSG:25833 -o wkt1_gdal
generates a WKT with the two AXIS tags (easting-northing). Is that valid?

Actually AXIS elements are supported in the WKT 1 format as defined by 
the OGC 01-009 standard. The problem is that before OGC 01-009, WKT 1 
was defined in a much more ambiguous way in a prior OGC specification 
named "Simple Features". That prior specification indeed had no AXIS 
element (among other ambiguities). OGC 01-009 tried to fix those 
ambiguities, but unfortunately it arrived too late; the prior 
specification had already been interpreted in different ways by 
different software, and we had no reliable way to know which flavor of 
WKT 1 a given string was using. WKT 2 resolves that problem by using 
different keywords, which makes clear that WKT 2 is used.

Subject: [PROJ] GitHub changed their RSA SSH host key
Message-ID: <CADRrdKtpxHaudSSRnGimrEiZbpTcfVEMHq6FHNeicWCFhu3pWw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

In case you use GitHub (for PROJ or anything else) this may be interesting
for you:
https://github.blog/2023-03-23-we-updated-our-rsa-ssh-host-key/

First paragraph:
At approximately 05:00 UTC on March 24, out of an abundance of caution, we
replaced our RSA SSH host key used to secure Git operations for GitHub.com.
We did this to protect our users from any chance of an adversary
impersonating GitHub or eavesdropping on their Git operations over SSH.
This key does not grant access to GitHub?s infrastructure or customer data.
This change only impacts Git operations over SSH using RSA. Web traffic to
GitHub.com and HTTPS Git operations are not affected.

Is there action needed in OSGeo repos?

Cheers,
Javier.

Hi,

I believe not, but existing contributors to repositories on GitHub who use SSH might get an warning when trying to push or pull from the remote.

The correct action is to run ssh-keygen -R github.com, then try again, and confirming the prompt after making sure that the new fingerprint matches one of the three from https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/githubs-ssh-key-fingerprints.

Hi PROJ community

Recently somebody asked me why do I pronounce PROJ that way.
What I try to say is /?pr?d?/  ( hear it somehow
http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=%CB%88pr%C9%92d%CA%92 )
Is there any "official" way or consensus about it?

Thanks.
Javier.

My opinions have formed in a vacuum separated from actually talking to
others, but:

  I see PROJ as sort for "projection".

  I pronounce it as rhyming with "dodge".  This has a different vowel
  and different voicing of the j sound than when I say the word
  projection.

  I view my pronunciation as the way I expect other native en_US
  speakers to read it (knowing/guessing "proj is short for projection")
  without any prior experience.  en_CA and maybe en_GB I would maybe
  expect a long O, but I am pretty sure Gerald Evenden was from the US.

Relative to the ipa-reader.xyz "sally - american", I say it faster, with
the vowel being maybe 2/3 the length and the j even less.  But it's
quite close, and I'm from ~Boston so I talk wicked fast compared to
people from e.g. Georgia.

You can hear a shift to a slightly longer O in "brian - british".  A
Canadian might have a much larger shift to fully long O, the way they
would says "process", but I think the short word somewhat avoids that.

Since you have started ...


I am London English and I say it (like you based on that fact it is short
for projection) with the same vowel as US "process" and not the vowel from
UK "process" ... No one ever said that the English were consistent ... :).

But to be honest, the o sounds in English English ( as opposed to Scottish
or Welsh or RP) are highly class dependant.

No one is ever going to agree about the bowl sounds. The consistent part is
that it ends with a hard(-ish) "j"

Thanks!

I was not expecting the discussion about the pronunciation of the vowel
"o", may fault XD. This can be a never ending topic among native English
speakers (to many similar sounds for me).
My question was more oriented to the final "j". So far we agree on that.
The rhyme with "dodge" is useful.

Cheers,
Javier.

To my Danish ears, and following relaxed Danish orthography, PROJ is just
the short form of PR?DTSCHJJJ, when speaking English, and PR???Y when
speaking Danish (give it a try :-) ) , so I can hardly claim to be
consistent in the pronunciation...  and neither would I encourage anyone
else to be: Pronounce it whichever way you feel (even PROOOOOOOOOY, PRUY,
or PREJ), but spell it as PROJ :-)

For me as a non-native English speaker, the pronunciation that rhymes on dodge (ending ?dzj?; IPA: / d? /) seems weird. I (probably wrongly) pronounce the English word projection with way less emphasis on the Z sound and much more emphasis on the J sound (IPA: / d? /). So for me, proj almost rhymes with Troy (IPA: / ? /).

I?m from NE England and I always mentally pronounced it to rhyme with dodge, with a short /o/ sound.
 
To me that?s not ?correct? because ?Proj? comes from ?Projection?, which I would pronounce with a long /oh/ sound.
However, it is correct because ?Proj? is a noun. In typical English prosody with homonymic nouns and verbs,
the noun is pronounced with a short vowel, the verb with a long vowel.
 
e.g.:
 
record (noun) /?r?k??d/ - ?a thing constituting a piece of evidence
record (verb) /r??k??d/ - the act of making a record J
 
Thus:
 
project (noun) /?pr?d?.ekt/ - an individual or collaborative enterprise that is carefully planned to achieve a particular aim.
project (verb) /pr??d?ekt/ - extend outwards beyond something else

For me as a non-native English speaker, the pronunciation that rhymes on dodge (ending ?dzj?; IPA: / d? /) seems weird. I (probably wrongly) pronounce the English word projection with way less emphasis on the Z sound and much more emphasis on the J sound (IPA: / d? /). So for me, proj almost rhymes with Troy (IPA: / ? /).

To my Danish ears, and following relaxed Danish orthography, PROJ is just the short form of PR?DTSCHJJJ, when speaking English, and PR???Y when speaking Danish (give it a try :-) ) , so I can hardly claim to be consistent in the pronunciation...  and neither would I encourage anyone else to be: Pronounce it whichever way you feel (even PROOOOOOOOOY, PRUY, or PREJ), but spell it as PROJ :-)

Thanks!
 
I was not expecting the discussion about the pronunciation of the vowel "o", may fault XD. This can be a never ending topic among native English speakers (to many similar sounds for me).
My question was more oriented to the final "j". So far we agree on that. The rhyme with "dodge" is useful.
 
Cheers,
Javier.

I am London English and I say it (like you based on that fact it is short for projection) with the same vowel as US "process" and not the vowel from UK "process" ... No one ever said that the English were consistent ... :).
 
But to be honest, the o sounds in English English ( as opposed to Scottish or Welsh or RP) are highly class dependant.
 
No one is ever going to agree about the bowl sounds. The consistent part is that it ends with a hard(-ish) "j"

My opinions have formed in a vacuum separated from actually talking to
others, but:

  I see PROJ as sort for "projection".

  I pronounce it as rhyming with "dodge".  This has a different vowel
  and different voicing of the j sound than when I say the word
  projection.

  I view my pronunciation as the way I expect other native en_US
  speakers to read it (knowing/guessing "proj is short for projection")
  without any prior experience.  en_CA and maybe en_GB I would maybe
  expect a long O, but I am pretty sure Gerald Evenden was from the US.

Relative to the ipa-reader.xyz "sally - american", I say it faster, with
the vowel being maybe 2/3 the length and the j even less.  But it's
quite close, and I'm from ~Boston so I talk wicked fast compared to
people from e.g. Georgia.

You can hear a shift to a slightly longer O in "brian - british".  A
Canadian might have a much larger shift to fully long O, the way they
would says "process", but I think the short word somewhat avoids that.

Hi, 
I recently had the same discussion QGIS!  I ended googling for a conference with the original creator of the project to settle the discussion.  He uses 2 different pronunciation in the same conference.  I suggest you do the same.

As an almost perfectly bilingual person living in Canada (French but grew up in an anglophone community) I use our ?project? pronunciation with an ?o? as in ?The car was towed.? I can imagine some people pronounce the o as an ?aw? or broad ?o? as  in ?I dodged a bullet!?

Using ? Sally English American ?   Copy ?prod? to hear what I say.

Tomato Tomato!!! :)

Javier,

yes the conventions are different. PROJ follows (mostly) 
https://docs.ogc.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html#37:

"""

Identifier is an optional attribute which references an external 
description of the object and which may be applied to a coordinate 
reference system, a coordinate operation or a bound CRS. It may also be 
utilised for components of these objects although this is recommended 
only for the following circumstances:

  * coordinate operation methods and parameters;
  * source and target CRSs when embedded within a coordinate
    transformation or a concatenated coordinate operation;
  * source CRS when embedded within a point motion operation;
  * individual coordinate operations embedded within a concatenated
    coordinate operation;
  * base CRS when embedded within a derived CRS (including projected CRS);
  * source CRS, target CRS and abridged transformation when embedded
    within a bound CRS;
  * individual members of a datum ensemble.

"""

So if the top object has an ID, generally its sub-objects won't have 
their IDs emitted, except the above exceptions (I see we don't emit ids 
for individual members of a datum ensemble. I remember that those 
exceptions have been in flux, so probably this was changed after this 
was implemented in PROJ. anyway I would be inclined to to change that 
now, as datum ensemble are sufficiently verbose as they are)

See 
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/bafe3a91901b4515a8017a6b019e43edb74a0764/src/iso19111/io.cpp#L485 
for the logic. It could be tuned to whatever people fancy for their WKT 
(there's actually a predefined WKT2_SIMPLIFIED variant where there are 
no ids on projection methods and parameters), since the omission of id 
is a convention, and not a hard rule

There's always a bit of "tension" about the appropriate verbosity of 
WKT: should it be a full dump of the (extract of) the underlying 
geodetic database or just a summary with the appropriate level of detail.

Start by checking whether your call to proj_create_crs_to_crs succeeds
(i.e. whether it returns NULL or not, as also suggested in the PROJ
documentation over at https://proj.org/development/quickstart.html). And in
general always check the return status of function calls, cf. e.g.
https://proj.org/development/errorhandling.html

If NULL is returned, your PROJ installation is probably not complete
(lacking support files and/or setting of environment variables). In that
case follow the tracks laid out in https://proj.org/resource_files.html
