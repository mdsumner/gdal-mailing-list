Hi All

I need to provide lat/lons from GeoTIFF images of South Africa in the
Tranverse Mercator (south-oriented) projection.  It seems as if Proj4 does
not currently support this.  Is there anyone who has hacked it, or any other
suggestions?

Thanx

What do you mean "south oriented projection?"

Jerry, 

See the description extracted from the EPSG database:

http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/transverse_mercator_south_oriented.html

Assuming this isn't directly supported now, how would you suggest handling
it within PROJ.4?  Should a new proj=tmso be implemented that just internally
calls the proj=tm code, and transforms the coordinates appropriately 
afterwards?

Best regards,

Without my having to dig out my references out, is the sign of the northing
increase
in a positive manner as the latitude increases southerly?

Logical use of TM would dictate that the normal TM projection is used with a
false northing sufficiently far south to make the "zone" of interest still
positive in
the northing values.  To do otherwise is most illogical, to say the least.

Also: "westing?"  Is that positive also?

My, my, I'm getting the idea that being "down under" has drained all the
blood from the head to the other end.  But the Ausies don't seem to have
this problem.

Au contraire, monsieur.  The South Africans have been doing it this way for
about a century.  They are not the only ones with what seems "upside down"
to us in the Northern Hemisphere.  Have you ever seen a map of the world
that is compiled and printed in Australia?

Consider that if you accept the closest pole to you as being positive
latitude, the South Africans use the same quadrant logic as we do in North
America, including the absolute value of "increasing" longitude.

Like Buggs Bunny sez: "Eh, what's up, Doc?"

I certainly do not want to get into a brouhaha over the upside down world
other than offer my last comments on this issue.

Granted there is probably a bit of chavenism with having the North as
positive and oriented at the top of maps but since the bulk of the world
population lives in the northern hemisphere this makes a reasonable
choice and, because we have the most votes, it should be a standard.

Secondly, since the polarity is total arbitrary with no word from God
as to what is right or wrong, the choice to choose a southern polarity
was obviously thumbing the nose at those who stayed behind in the
north.  I'm just responding: "Your mother wears combat boots!"  ;-)

In the meantime, the majority of the population has to do cartwheels
for the minority's vanity.

Wow!  They are the same! 

Conveniently your file has no false easting or northing so there is
no issue with the "sign" of that.  For everything else it almost seems as
if there is no difference between TM and TMSO.  However, I kind of wonder if
this is just that Descartes is just treating TM and TMSO as being the same.

Can you verify if the Descartes corner coordinates in PCS and lat/long 
coordinates make sense when compared with the map surround?

Message-ID: <39CB92EB.93C2C5FC@home.com>


Folks, 

I am issuing a PROJ 4.4.2 release.  It includes the new datum handling, which
should be considered an "Alpha" release, but in other regards it should be a
stable production release. 

It can be downloaded from:

  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/proj/proj-4.4.2.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/proj/proj-4.4.2.zip

The ChangeLog reports:

-- 2000-09-22  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at cs46980-c>

	* Update version to 4.4.2, in preparation for 4.4.2 release.

	* Ensure makefile.vc is distributed, and mention windows building
	in README.

	* Cast args to freev2() in bch2bps.c, and mk_cheby.c to avoid errors
	on the Cray.

2000-09-21  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at cs46980-c>

	* Added "sphere" to pj_ellps.c. 

2000-07-06  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at cs46980-c>

	* Fixed bug in nad_init() with path for datum shifting files.

	* Implemented cs2cs program for transforming between coordinate systems
	including datum shifts.

	* Implemented proj=latlong pseudo-projection.

	* Implemented pj_transform() to transform from one coordinate system
	to another, including applying geocentric datum shifts, and NAD27
	grid shifts.

	* Implemented 3/7 parameter geocentric datum shift support.

	* Added support for +datum, +towgs84, and +nadgrids parameters
	when defining PJ's (for pj_init()).  Added datum_type, and datum_params
	to PJ structure.

2000-07-04  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at cs46980-c>

	* Patched proj.c to handle binary io properly on Windows and DOS.
	Patch submitted by Thomas Knudsen <thk at kms.dk>.

2000-04-26  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at cs46980-c>

	* Added #define USE_PROJUV to projects.h to allow apps to
	work properly against old and new version.

2000-04-04  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at rommel.atlsci.com>

	* Patch from Craig Bruce (cbruce at cubewerx.com) for PJ_ortho.c
	to make INVERSE() work well for points near zero.

2000-03-29  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerda at cs46980-c>

	* Added hard links for invproj->proj and invgeod->geod in 
	src/Makefile.{am,in}.

I actually had to wait to be able to build it!  (timestamps in
the future for my timezone!)  :-)

It appears the file emess.h is missing:

$ make CFLAGS="-O2 -g -Wall"
Making all in src
make[1]: Entering directory `/deb/src/proj/proj-4.4.2/src'
make[1]: *** No rule to make target `emess.h', needed by `emess.lo'.  Stop.
make[1]: Leaving directory `/deb/src/proj/proj-4.4.2/src'

$ tar ztf proj-4.4.2.tar.gz | grep emess
proj-4.4.2/src/emess.c

Peter,

Sorry about that.   I was missing emess.h, and geocent.h.  I have rebuilt
the tar and zip files and replaced them on ftp.remotesensing.org.  Note that
we are in the same timezone, but computer is just screwed up with regard to
daylight savings time.
