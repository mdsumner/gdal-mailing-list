Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] java port of proj-4
Message-ID: <4.3.0.20000402154017.00a736d0@mail.btinternet.com>

I am looking to improve support for projections in my open source Java 
mapping toolkit geotools.

proj seems like a good place to start so I'm looking to port the code into 
a Java class library that can be used separately or in conjunction with 
geotools.

Before I start however, I would like to check that an open source 
implementation of the code is not already available in Java so that I don't 
waste my time re-implementing it.

If there is no existing port then I will set to work.  Is there a set of 
test files that I could use to put through any code that I write to check 
that I am getting the right results?

Thanks in anticipation

James.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] MGRS?
Message-ID: <38E76350.7114DC96@erg.sri.com>

I'd like to inquire if there's any interest in support for MGRS in the
Proj library  -- anybody else use this?

There's support in other places, but I find it awkward to use Proj for
some purposes, another library for MGRS, etc.  I can certainly take the
lead in coding/testing if thats what it takes.  I have a number of
reference sites, however I'd appreciate any pointers others may have as
well.

Note, that it unfortunately requires additional interfaces into the
library, as the MGRS coordinate is a string (typically 15 characters),
not a pair of doubles.

BTW: on a related topic, I've found the UTM support awkward to use.
Ideally, I'd like to plug in a Long/Lat pair, and get back UTM with the
"proper" zone number.   Currently, one must *know* the zone and use that
as a projection parameter.  Both behaviors are useful.  This would also
require additional interface mods.   Comments?

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] MGRS?
Message-ID: <002001bf9cbb$bb1cafa0$a8b9d33f@gevenden>

I have thought about MGRS a couple of times but felt it represented
a zone or regional designation rather than a point and thus a little
more difficult to determine a rigorous determination.

Regarding "automatic" UTM by only specifying longitude, there is
a technical problem: UTM zones allow a half degree overlap (actually
3.5 degrees wide) so geographic coordinates laying in this region
are ambiguous as to which zone to apply.  Secondly, this ambiguity
always exists for those points on the even 6 degrees.

One can also specify the central meridian for UTM and PROJ.4 will
automatically adjust it to the proper zone CM.  BUT, if the specified
CM is on an even 6 degrees the determination may toggle to either
CM.  Remember, CMs are on all 6xN+3 degree meridians.

Lastly, even if the longitude could be used as a CM determinator,
the control stucture for the projection would have to be
intialized for *each* lat/lon determined.  That is, open and closed
for each point computed.

As for getting the zone number used out of an opened control
structure...  Hmmm.  First, I don't recall if the zone number is preserved
in the structure and secondly, projection specific contents of the structure
are
only defined in the UTM/tmerc code and may not globally available.

I *really* don't think this is a good idea.

Oh yes!  Some zones in the Scandinavian region have funky limits
and simplistic determination from longitude cannot be used.

Hey, if elephants could fly.

James,

You might want to look at OpenMap for Java implementations of a few
projections, but I am not aware of an OpenSource projections library
with the breadth of PROJ. 

I am not aware of a set of test data files, but you should be able to 
create these easily, and compare projection results from PROJ and your newly
developed libraries.  I am also interested in doing some comparison of 
results between PROJ, GCTP and Geotrans to verify that everything is kosher.

Rick,

I pretty much agree with what Gerald had to say about UTM; however, I still
think a function to return the preferred zone given a lat/long position is
helpful. 

For MGRS.  I am familiar with MGRS being used to specify a region (perhaps
a square on a mapsheet), and then have a set of coordinates within that region,
relative to it's origin.  To me, it seems that MGRS should be a sort of zonal
system where a user can pass in a projection string specifying an MGRS
region, and it would internally be translated to the corresponding set of
transverse mercator parameters, including false easting and northing. 

I would like to do something like this for a variety of zonal systems, 
including state plane, but I am not sure what form it should take.  In
the meantime, you might want to implement a function which can take a PROJ.4
style string and if it recognises an "MGRS" projection it would substitute
the corresponding TM parameters and offset.

I'm not sure what other applications might exist for a "automatic" UTM, but
the main one that I can think of is an interactive browser situation where
someone is viewing a rendered image on the screen.  In this situation,
it makes perfect sense for the browser system to automatically select
the UTM zone (and hemisphere) to use based on the center point of the
display window.  Of course, the [a] calculation of the UTM zone of the
center point of the image given its lat/lon is so simple that it doesn't
really need to be part of the Proj library.

zone = floor( (lon0 + 180.0) / 6.0 ) + 1;

In an interactive browser situation, the center point lat/lon would be
determined and this UTM zone (and single control structure) would be used
to transform all of the coordinates.

In an interactive browsing situation, the user probably wouldn't care
about any special situations.

In my reply I was not considering an interactive usage.  Mechanisms
in this case are infinitely varied as is the use of the PROJ library.
For example, an alternative is to display the global zone map and
require a click on the requested zone.  I might add that the irregular
zones of Scandinavia negate merely focusing the zone screen on
the region of interest unless the magnification was sufficiently
large.

Hi all,

concerning the datum problem and PROJ4 I have
a question (as PROJ4 is included in GRASS 5):

Say, I have a map in UTM/WGS84. Using the
map projection modules of GRASS (r.proj/v.proj)
I can project the map to the German
"Gauss-Krueger-System" (Transverse Mercator,
Bessel Ellipsoid).

But what about datum conversion? Gauss-Krueger
is based on Potsdam-Datum (near Berlin).

BTW: Interesting page about nearly all European
map systems (by Stefan A. Vosser):
http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1224/mapref.html

especially: "Map Projections" there.

I am not familiar with this datum stuff, any
hints to clear the situation are welcome.
>From former comments I learned that PROJ4 does
not support datum conversion, but maybe nad2nad
to be extended to support conversions outside U.S.?
Please excuse if this is a stupid questions...

Kind regards

Yes, I understand. But my question was more related to 
following, more general, point:

Do I need datum conversion if reprojecting a map
from UTM/WGS84 to Transverse Mercator/Bessel?
The German system is based on Potsdam-Datum, the
UTM datum I don't know.

As nad2nad is existing, the datum conversion seems
to be important.

Since the target coordinates are based upon the Bessel ellipsiod
the original WGS84 datum coordinates will almost certainly
require a datum correction.

In any case of datum conversion of cartesian data, the data must be:

1. cartesian to geographic (inverse projection),

2. datum conversion in geographic space and finally

3. converted to cartesian (forward projection).

*Nad2nad* will take care of this entire operation but ONLY for USA data.
In your case, you will need to some procedure to take care of
step 2. Proj can take care of steps 1 and 3 provided correct
ellipsoid is given.  Note, the above steps are those carried out
in *nad2nad*.

Hi Markus,

i am no geodesist and no specialist in datum conversion. But it seems to
me that grass already includes the bits and pieces for datum shift:

m.datum.shift -> returns geog. coordinates based on a different spheroid
and datum.
m.gc2ll -> converts geocentric to geographic coordinates
m.ll2gc -> converts geographic coordinates to geocentric coordinates
m.ll2u, m.u2ll -> convertes geographic coords to UTM and vice versa
m.proj, m.geo etc.

All those modules require the coordinates in command-line, so they are
useful only for calculating reference points etc. But the code is
included in grass. 

It would be much work to change all modules for projecting/reprojecting
(v.proj, r.proj) to include datum shift because the user must specify
the datum for input/output and the module must use a changed API. But in
theory the code is already included.

Beste Gruesse,

Andreas

Message-ID: <3906F9CC.C49EA53B@home.com>

Folks,

One of the changes to PROJ requested for Windows portability was to rename
UV as it conflicted with some windows define.  I modified the structure name
to projUV in all the PROJ.4 code in the 4.4.0/1 releases.  However, I didn't 
really think it through very carefully, and as released there is no way for
a program being built to detect whether it should use UV or projUV.  I have
modified projects.h to #define USE_PROJUV in newer versions so that applications
can check for this.  Unfortunately PROJ 4.4.0 and 4.4.1 will still be hard to
identify.  For anyone in a pinch it should be sufficient to #define projUV to
UV before #including projects.h if USE_PROJUV isn't used. 

Best regards,

You catch me at a bad time as I am about to upgrade my system
and do a lot of moving and backup so my source of PROJ is
in current limbo.  But, ...

I realize that defines used in one system may be inconflict with other,
totally unrelated, systems but I question the desirablility of the method
to resolve this problem, especially one that requires changes to basic
elements of either system.  BTW, when referring to "windows" are we
talking M$ or X11?

A second point is release number and basic designation of PROJ.4.
This brings up the point as to the "official" source point of PROJ.4.
In some cases, this is view as the USGS site kai.er.usgs.gov.
It is going to get *very* confusing if different sites come up with
individual audit trails on their release numbers for the basic
designation of "PROJ.4."

This is not supplying solutions, just raising some issues.
