Frank,

I would like to motion to promote RC1 as the 4.9.0 release. Any subsequent fixes or changes can go in a new minor release. This is an official motion to the MetaCRS PSC to adopt this RC as a final release.

I vote no...

(1) http://download.osgeo.org/proj lists an RC2

(2) Even Rouault has supplied two patches so proj can
build cleanly on a Linux machine.  These need to be reviewed
and folded into an RC3.

I tried 4.9.0RC2 on NetBSD with pkgsrc.   A few issues:

* installed files changed.  First block is files no longer installed and
  second block is new files.  Of course I can update PLIST - I'm posting
  the delta in case any of it is unexpected.  From NEWS it seems ok,
  except for proj_def.dat going away which is not mentioned (that I
  understood).

Hi,
Small patchs are attached in order to have minimal support for opening files under wince using pj_set_searchpath.
I hope I'm in the right place to send this patch.

Subject: [Proj] Map projection used for CADRG polar areas?
Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD493DD61303@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello,
I am reading the specification for CADRG,
http://earth-info.nga.mil/publications/specs/printed/89038/89038_CADRG.pdf .
But I am confused about the polar areas.

Section 3.5.5 says: "CADRG shall use a polar stereographic projection".

And Section 3.5.6 says "Polar frames are defined in polar stereographic
projection and non-polar frames are in the ARC projection."

But Section 3.6.2 says: "Pixel coordinates in the polar zones are
proportional to rectangular coordinates of the Azimuthal
Equidistant projection, polar aspect, spherical form (as
defined in Map Projections-A Working Manual, page 191)."

And section 30.1 says: "Polar zone equations are based on
the Azimuthal Equidistant projection, polar aspect,
spherical form."

Since Polar Stereographic is not the same thing as Azimuthal Equidistant
in polar aspect, I assume that one of the two alternatives is just a typo
(unless I am missing something). But which one is the typo of
"Stereographic" and "Azimuthal Equidistant"? Does anyone know?

Best regards,

Mikael Rittri

Mikael,

Based on my code in GDAL, the answer would be Azimuthal Equidistant :
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/frmts/nitf/nitfdataset.cpp#L1005

But it is perhaps wrong. However, my experience with data showed that the 4 
corner coordinates reprojected from long/lat to aeqd form a rectangle. But 
that might also be true of polar stereographic...

Did you check if the maths given in 30.5.1 "North polar region" are consistant 
with an aeqd method ?

Another clue is that the ASRP specification 
(https://www.dgiwg.org/digest/documents/asrp_1_2.pdf), quite close to CADRG 
regarding the ARC system, mentions : "3.2.3 Polar zones are square arrays of 
tiles overlaid mathematically on a polar azimuthal equidistant projection". 
And its maths at "B.2.2 North Polar Case" look very much the same as the one 
of CADRG.

Subject: [Proj] Convertion Lat/Long WGS84 -> UTM-WGS84 problem?
Message-ID: <CAEiYJTGS41kr_ZDMeK9k60L1jWfgzf84=wjw7R0MfN5A2CX-aw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I have written a simple basic code inspired from the doc to convert data in
lat/long WGS84 in meters (UTM/WGS84)
My problem is that when I tested it with lat: 51.0242 / long: 3.96338 and
obtained  x: 7627600.282316 / y: 742130.588781 which I compared with online
converter which gave me : 5652958 / 567564

I would like to understand the error. I that because proj can't convert
from WGS84 lat/long to UTM WGS84 ?

I tested with command line:
echo 51.0242 3.96338 | cs2cs.exe +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84 +to +proj=utm
+ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m
and obtained the exact same result.

Any advice?

Thanks

Clercq

Hello

Two problems with your procedure:
- PROJ expects coordinates in the order long/lat and not lat/long
- You must specify the UTM zone number

echo 3.96338 51.0242 | cs2cs.exe +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84 +to +proj=utm
+ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +zone=31 +units=m

Dear,

I thought the order long/lat or lat/long where defined using
+proj=[longlat, latlong], anyway I have only tested without the zone number

Thanks a lot.

Charles.

Good idea. The math in 30.5.1 is definitely a spherical aeqd method.

I found some polar sample data, and the corner coordinates
do not form a rectangle if I try to use polar stereographic.
Almost, but not quite - I found differences of about 1 km. 

So I am now certain that the mention of "stereographic" is
just a typo in the document.

Mikael,

Based on my code in GDAL, the answer would be Azimuthal Equidistant :
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/trunk/gdal/frmts/nitf/nitfdataset.cpp#L1005

But it is perhaps wrong. However, my experience with data showed that the 4 
corner coordinates reprojected from long/lat to aeqd form a rectangle. But 
that might also be true of polar stereographic...

Did you check if the maths given in 30.5.1 "North polar region" are consistant 
with an aeqd method ?

Another clue is that the ASRP specification 
(https://www.dgiwg.org/digest/documents/asrp_1_2.pdf), quite close to CADRG 
regarding the ARC system, mentions : "3.2.3 Polar zones are square arrays of 
tiles overlaid mathematically on a polar azimuthal equidistant projection". 
And its maths at "B.2.2 North Polar Case" look very much the same as the one 
of CADRG.

Dear Proj list members:

Being a very new in this field, could someone answer me about the following
problem:

I have a pair of Geodetic Latitude and Geodetic Longitude (50.89524,
117.69043).
How can I convert it into Latitude and Longitude with WGS84 Ellepsoid?

Thanks in the advance.

Hi Artur.

It could be the same thing. "Geodetic" latitude is the same as ordinary,
everyday latitude. There are some other flavours of latitude as well,
auxiliary latitudes that are mainly used to simplify some kinds of
computations, but "geodetic" is the ordinary kind.

For longitudes, there is only one flavour, but the zero meridian is
not always Greenwich.

So the coordinates you mention could be in WGS84 Lat/Long already.
But it is not certain, since they could be expressed in some other
geodetic datum that uses a different ellipsoid.

Do you have any documentation about the geodetic datum of your
coordinates (like Pulkovo 1942, Pulkovo 1995, PZ 1990, or WGS84),
or about the ellipsoid used?

Best regards,

Dear Mikael Rittri

Thanks for your answer.
Actually, I could not understand which datum or ellepsoid was used. The
following documents says only geodetic latitude and longitude:

http://modaps.nascom.nasa.gov/services/about/products/MOD03.html

I have read the above data product; and retrieved the pairs of geodetic
lats and lons as the document says, but could not figure out if  I should
convert them into WGS84 or not. I have to compare the data using above
product with other data which are in WGS84 lats and lons.

Dear all,

I found a pdf document: http://www.yale.edu/ceo/Documentation/MODIS_data.pdf

which state: "The data are provided in the HDF-EOS format. MODIS data at
version 4 and above use
the Sinusoidal projection with the WGS84 datum. A very small sample of
common
products are listed below."

Hope it helps

Thank you Charles. However, the statement you have found is for land
products, and I am using atmospheric products. In this case, the data are
provided in geographic coordinate system. The pair of lats and lons I have
read are in geographic coordinate system, but do not know the datum.

Artur,

The reason why the geodetic datum is not documented for your dataset,
can be that it is not very important. The resolution of the dataset was 1 km,
but the usual mismatch between two geodetic datums would seldom be
more than 500 m.

For example, let's assume that your data was given in Pulkovo 1942.
If I am not mistaken, one way to transform your coordinates would in
that case be to use cs2cs like this:

>cs2cs +proj=longlat +ellips=krass +towgs84=23.57,-140.95,-79.8,0,0.35,0.79,0.22 +to +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 -f "%.5f"
117.69043 50.89524
117.69118       50.89578 -146.13626

where I used the datum shift EPSG:5044, "Pulkovo 1942 to WGS 84 (20)",
valid in Russia with 3 m accuracy.

If this was the correct transformation, but you forgot to do it, the difference
would be only 80 meters, which could be insignificant when the data resolution
is 1 km.

But of course, that would depend on the usage of the dataset.

Well - if this is a NASA product, I would bet that they use WGS84.

Regards,
  Mikael

Dear all,

I found a pdf document: http://www.yale.edu/ceo/Documentation/MODIS_data.pdf

which state: "The data are provided in the HDF-EOS format. MODIS data at version 4 and above use
the Sinusoidal projection with the WGS84 datum. A very small sample of common
products are listed below."

Hope it helps

Thank you Charles. However, the statement you have found is for land products, and I am using atmospheric products. In this case, the data are provided in geographic coordinate system. The pair of lats and lons I have read are in geographic coordinate system, but do not know the datum.

Hi Artur.

It could be the same thing. "Geodetic" latitude is the same as ordinary,
everyday latitude. There are some other flavours of latitude as well,
auxiliary latitudes that are mainly used to simplify some kinds of
computations, but "geodetic" is the ordinary kind.

For longitudes, there is only one flavour, but the zero meridian is
not always Greenwich.

So the coordinates you mention could be in WGS84 Lat/Long already.
But it is not certain, since they could be expressed in some other
geodetic datum that uses a different ellipsoid.

Do you have any documentation about the geodetic datum of your
coordinates (like Pulkovo 1942, Pulkovo 1995, PZ 1990, or WGS84),
or about the ellipsoid used?

Dear Mikael Rittri

Thanks for your answer.
Actually, I could not understand which datum or ellepsoid was used. The following documents says only geodetic latitude and longitude:

http://modaps.nascom.nasa.gov/services/about/products/MOD03.html

I have read the above data product; and retrieved the pairs of geodetic lats and lons as the document says, but could not figure out if  I should convert them into WGS84 or not. I have to compare the data using above product with other data which are in WGS84 lats and lons.

Best regards,

Dear Proj list members:

Being a very new in this field, could someone answer me about the following problem:

I have a pair of Geodetic Latitude and Geodetic Longitude (50.89524, 117.69043).
How can I convert it into Latitude and Longitude with WGS84 Ellepsoid?

Thanks in the advance.

Artur

Subject: [Proj] the x, and y meaning in pj_transform
Message-ID: <CADk-=6dNSP3=KUyaJP8DkfFzVjWnyzk-TAPVF867=O3QV_6ffA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I have got a small question that I can not find the confirmed answer on the
web. I am now using pj_transform to transform coordinates from svy21 to
latlon using the following code snippet:

pj_svy21 = pj_init_plus("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=1.366666666666667
+lon_0=103.8333333333333 +k=1 +x_0=28001.642 +y_0=38744.572 +ellps=WGS84
+units=m +no_defs")
pj_latlong = pj_init_plus("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84
+no_defs")

double svy_east = 12056.915;
double svy_north = 37621.665;

double lat_radian = svy_east;
double lon_radian = svy_north;
projResult = pj_transform(pj_svy21, pj_latlong, 1, 0, &lat_radian,
&lon_radian, NULL );

But the result (lat_radian, lon_radian) I got is reversed, i.e. the result
given by

pj_transform(pj_svy21, pj_latlong, 1, 0, &x, &y, NULL )

is x corresponds to longitude and y corresponds to latitude. It is not
the other way around as I did.

Is this the way it worked or I just used this function wrongly? Thanks.

Best regards,
Zhang Qun

Longitude is usually East, and Latitude is North. Proj expects your data 
in this order when you enter +proj=longlat.

It would be good to see proj-4.9.0 progressing towards a release.
However it appears to be in a stalled state.  Who is waiting for whom?
