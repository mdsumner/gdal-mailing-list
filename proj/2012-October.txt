Hello,

without going any deep in your question ..

if you are far away from what is expected
you might need some additional parameters
to the projection setup... either lat_0, lon_0 needs
some initialization value or x_0 or y_0 is
missing something.. or some other parameter
with that projection .. if that does not help then
the projection might be wrong... etc. etc..

Hi,
Thanks for the replies.  We did find that moving the lat_0, lon_0
parameters into the actual working area solved most of our issues.  This
just appears to be one of those issues where ESRI's projection engine
gives a "better" result than Proj.4 does.  I find myself wondering if
under the hood they move the origin latitude and central meridian into
the work area, then add the difference in origins back as a false
easting / false northing so that the user is unaware of the change.....

In any case, thanks much Janne

Joe White

Hello,

yes, nice that it helped .. usually the local mapping standards have
zones and they usually have some initial values for those parameters
which you never know if not really known. If those parameters are
missing you usually get far away from what is expected.

Here is an example of KKJ - Finland

proj=tmerc
lat_0=0
lon_0=27
k=1
x_0=3500000
y_0=0
ellps=intl
units=m
no_defs

Subject: [Proj] PROJ.4: pj_transform parameters
Message-ID: <CABvPaVQB0HR6RdpVXLAx--v5g9zr22=fvyPZrQh9rGXFTRPsTw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all

Im developer and this is the first time I touch PROJ.4 . And I have
following problem , please anyone can give me an advice:

In my project I need to do *transformation from datums  (US, North America,
UK, South Africa, New Zealand) to WGS84. *

After having a look at defintion of pj_transform  (function to do datums
transformation on PROJ.4). I have seen that there are so many input
parameters.

For example : following code that I found in internet :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    projPJ src= pj_init_plus("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=38N +lon_0=128E
+ellps=bessel +x_0=400000 +y_0=600000 +k=0.9999
+towgs84=-146.43,507.89,681.46");
    projPJ dst= pj_init_plus("+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84");
    double x,y,z;
    x=100;
    y=100;
    z=100;
    pj_transform(src,dst,1,1,&x,&y,NULL);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  params for initionlization of datums
+proj=merc +ellps=clrk66 +lat_ts=33  +proj=latlong +ellps=clrk66
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are so many geospatial knowledge neccessary to understand these
parameter.
Im developer and I know just only the simple name of datums(WGS84, NAD27,
NAD83, etc,..) and coordinates of points,

With them how I can make transformation between different datums ? *Where I
can get input parameters and define correct geospatial input parameters.*

I very need your help. Thanks a lot.

Hi

On our proj4 installation you should have a directory call "nad". This
directory have some dictionnary of projection that could be used to define
projection parameters. For exemple with the lat/long wgs84 projection you
could use

projPJ src= pj_init_plus( "+init=epsg:4326");

see http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326 for searching your projection
code.
Take care of setting the PROJ_LIB environnement variable to the correct
path for your projection directory.

Hi David.

Thank you for quick support !

Is it right that for another datums (for example : NAD27, NAD83, OSGB, ED
50, etc,...) we can do transformation with only just simple initialization
like projPJ src= pj_init_plus( "+init=epsg:4326"); (I mean that we use only
+init parameter)

Clicking on http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326 I get :  " Not found,
/ref/epsg/4326. "

sorry a missing slash http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4326/ should
work better.
But you could also search on the epsg file on your nad directory,
# WGS 84
<4326> +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs  <>

I think you must add a final slash after 4326 to make that link work.

Another site you could look at is <http://www.epsg-registry.org> http://www.epsg-registry.org

The +init usually works, but when the underlying datum isn't
WGS84, you will not always get the best possible accuracy.
I believe the default implementation of OSGB36 isn't
very good, for example (it may have improved since
the last time I looked, though).

For ED50, I don't know any implementation that is good in
all of Europe/Middle East. The default has about 10 - 15 m
accuracy. If one needs higher accuracy, one must
choose an implementation that is tailor-made for a
smaller area, say Spain or some part of the North Sea.

Hi David.

Thank you for quick support !

Is it right that for another datums (for example : NAD27, NAD83, OSGB, ED 50, etc,...) we can do transformation with only just simple initialization
like projPJ src= pj_init_plus( "+init=epsg:4326"); (I mean that we use only +init parameter)

Hi all

Im developer and this is the first time I touch PROJ.4 . And I have following problem , please anyone can give me an advice:

In my project I need to do transformation from datums  (US, North America, UK, South Africa, New Zealand) to WGS84.

After having a look at defintion of pj_transform  (function to do datums transformation on PROJ.4). I have seen that there are so many input parameters.

For example : following code that I found in internet :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    projPJ src= pj_init_plus("+proj=tmerc +lat_0=38N +lon_0=128E +ellps=bessel +x_0=400000 +y_0=600000 +k=0.9999 +towgs84=-146.43,507.89,681.46");
    projPJ dst= pj_init_plus("+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84");
    double x,y,z;
    x=100;
    y=100;
    z=100;
    pj_transform(src,dst,1,1,&x,&y,NULL);
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
params for initionlization of datums
+proj=merc +ellps=clrk66 +lat_ts=33
+proj=latlong +ellps=clrk66
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are so many geospatial knowledge neccessary to understand these parameter.
Im developer and I know just only the simple name of datums(WGS84, NAD27, NAD83, etc,..) and coordinates of points,

With them how I can make transformation between different datums ? Where I can get input parameters and define correct geospatial input parameters.

I very need your help. Thanks a lot.

Hoang Doanh

Thanks Nicolas and Rittri for very good support .

I already understand more detail about transformation and input parameters
and the way to get them .

Thanks you very much !

Subject: [Proj] ESRI's standard_parallel_1 for Mercator morphed to
 latitude_of_origin?
Message-ID: <EED8E169-D379-446C-82E9-AD09CEBFBA45@carmenta.com>

This question really concerns GDAL/OGR rather than Proj.4, but anyway:

I have had a problem that I think was caused by 

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/7542

which caused the Mercator parameter "standard_parallel_1" in ESRI WKT to be
renamed to "latitude_of_origin" during conversion to OGC WKT. 

This makes no sense to me. These are different parameters with different semantics, and according to 
http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/mercator_2sp.html
both of them are valid parameter names for Mercator (2SP) in OGC WKT.

So why the renaming? Is the semantics subtly different in the ESRI world? 
Or is this just a bug that has survived because a Mercator seldom has a non-zero standard parallel?

I'd be grateful for comments.

Mikael,
It's not just you.  In the course of our software, we have to transition
data back and forth from ESRI to GDAL/OGR, and we have to do some
parameter name munging to get ESRI to take some of the coordinate system
data.

Joe,
by "parameter name munging", do you mean in addition to what is done by morphToESRI()
and morphFromESRI() in OGRSpatialReference? Can you give examples?
    Would you agree that for my example, morphFromESRI() makes a hypercorrection
(trying to fix what ain't broken)?
     By the way, I have found the analogous ticket http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3036
for Equidistant Cylindrical.

Yes, I do mean on top of what is done in MorphToESRI.   I'll check the
code to see what I can dig up for examples and post them to the list.

Joe,
by "parameter name munging", do you mean in addition to what is done by
morphToESRI() and morphFromESRI() in OGRSpatialReference? Can you give
examples?
    Would you agree that for my example, morphFromESRI() makes a
hypercorrection (trying to fix what ain't broken)?
     By the way, I have found the analogous ticket

Hello,

how accurate is the GeographicLib geoid separation calculation
anywhere on the earth?

Is it better than the EGM96 fortran 15 arc min bilinear implementation
which requires 2 Mb memory for the table?

The errors for various geoid models and various grid sizes are listed in

   http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/geoid.html#geoidinterp

For example for the 15' EGM96 grid using cubic interpolation the max and
RMS errors are 169mm and 7mm.  However, I would normally recommend the
5' EGM95 grid or the 2.5' or 1' EGM2008 grid.

GeographicLib uses 2 bytes per grid point to store the data (vs 4 bytes
per grid point for most other implementation) and, by default, does not
read the entire table into memory.

(Incidentally, GeographlicLib lets you work directly with the spherical
harmonic expansions of the geoid models using the Gravity class.  So you
can construct grids for any of EGM84, EGM96, or EGM2008 at any
resolution.)

While not as polished as the very impressive GeographicLib, I thought it 
was worth pointing out that an implementation I wrote a couple of years 
ago in C has similar properties (2 bytes per grid point, and 
user-specifiable how much of the grid to load into memory). It uses the 
cubic convolution interpolation method proposed by Keys in 1981. Some 
details here:

<https://haptimap.ee.qub.ac.uk/doc/group__standalone__gps.html>
(look at the egm96_* functions) and source code as well as binary grid 
file available here:

<https://haptimap.ee.qub.ac.uk/viewvc/haptimap/trunk/plugins/>

The software may be distributed under the LGPL license, although I have 
to admit this isn't at all clear from the above links...

Again, not so elegant (requires manual pre-processing with no nice API, 
but maybe still useful for an embedded application) - grids of any size 
at various resolutions may be created using the software here (slightly 
modified version of C code by D. Ineiv from 2006):

<https://haptimap.ee.qub.ac.uk/viewvc/haptimap/trunk/external/egm96/>

Just in case it is useful to anybody!

(yes, I know I'm top-posting and that it's not customary for the mailing list)

This may only get more confusing with the new EPSG Mercator and Stereographic variants. Currently, there are 4 Mercator variants (ignoring false easting/northing and easting/northing at false origin):

Mercator (Spherical) 

  Latitude of natural origin   
  Longitude of natural origin 

Mercator (variant A) aka 1SP

  Latitude of natural origin (must equal zero)   
  Longitude of natural origin   
  Scale factor at natural origin   

Mercator (variant B)

  Latitude of 1st standard parallel    
  Longitude of natural origin  

Mercator (variant C)

  Latitude of 1st standard parallel   
  Longitude of natural origin   
  Latitude of false origin   

Esri currently supports variant B and the Spherical version indirectly through Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) or by using a sphere-based geographic CRS. Esri wants "Central Meridian" and "Standard Parallel 1". Internally, we use an array to store parameters. SP1 and LatOfOrigin use different slots so it wouldn't work by chance either.

As usual if you need a version that is both fast and small .. you never find
it. It is either fast or small but not  both.

The geoid might be an interesting academic study but the ellipsoid is 
a much more stable zero reference and since the earth is not stable
by its nature (plate dynamics) it is obvious that the geoid will never
be fully fixed in time.

(  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoid )

"Recent satellite missions, such as GOCE and GRACE, have enabled the study of time-variable geoid signals. The first products based on GOCE satellite data became available online in June 2010, through the European Space Agency (ESA)s Earth observation user services tools.[11][12] ESA launched the satellite in March 2009 on a mission to map Earth's gravity with unprecedented accuracy and spatial resolution. On 31 March 2011, the new geoid model was unveiled at the Fourth International GOCE User Workshop hosted at the Technische Universität München in Munich, Germany.[13] Studies using the time-variable geoid computed from GRACE data have provided information on global hydrologic cycles,[14] mass balances of ice sheets,[15] and postglacial rebound.[16] From postglacial rebound measurements, time-variable GRACE data can be used to deduce the viscosity of Earth's mantle.[17]"

( http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=%20time-variable%20geoid%20computed%20from%20grace%20dat&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CCwQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fig.net%2Fpub%2Ffig2012%2Fpapers%2Fts04b%2FTS04B_avsar_ustun_5724.pdf&ei=GtB_UIqFD9Db4QSH8YCgDA&usg=AFQjCNFJgtaLbqSRIOCOOh06LKPzjfIR9A&cad=rja )

Academic?
The water flows down the geoid, NOT the ellipsoid.
Te ellipsoid is not fixed in time either, if not for isostasy an land
masses erosion,  sea level changes.

Well, not necessarily!!  Higher order interpolation will more faithfully
follow the spherical harmonic model of the geoid.  However most people
who use geoid heights are merely doing vertical datum shifts; and then
you need to ask how others are doing the interpolation.  (For example, I
was recently tasked with creating bare-earth DEMs from lidar data with
the lidar z being height over the ellipsoid and and the DEM being
referenced to EGM96.  However, I was required to use the 15' grid +
bilinear interpolation for EGM96 in order to conform to what others were
doing.)

It might be worth making a few other remarks about the geoid:

(1) The geoid is not mean sea level.  MSL includes local topographic
effects due to currents and the shape of the sea bed.  Marine charts
obvious will need to account for these (and they include tidal effects
with mean low tides or whatever).

(2) The normal to geoid does not give you the direction of gravity on

Hi,

Just a small point about building PROJ 4.8.0 for Windows:

The nmake.opt file distributed with PROJ 4.8.0 looks like this for the
non-debug case:

OPTFLAGS= /nologo /Ox /Op /MD

Note that the /Op option was removed after VS 2003, which means that you'll
get a "ignoring unknown options '/Op'" warning
for any of the four newer compilers.  I suggest it be removed from future
updates.

Thanks,

carl

The quick answer is "no", I know of no such library.

It might be worth digging a little into the issue, however...

For a geodesist, the issue has limited interest.  A triaxial model of
the earth has major/minor equatorial axes of 6378137 +/- 35 meters (see
my E-mail "Analyzing the bumps in the EGM2008 geoid" to proj.4 on
2011-07-04).  The EGM2008 geoid differs from the triaxial model by up to
+/- 70 m.  Thus while an oblate ellipsoid is a lot better at
approximating the geoid than a sphere (cutting the errors from 2 km to
100m), the triaxial ellipsoid offers only a modest increase in fidelity
(100m to 70m) at a considerable cost (see next...).

For a mathematician, a triaxial ellipsoid is of considerable interest.
Geodesics on an oblate ellipsoid are "easy" (in mathematical terms)
because the rotational symmetry of the system allows you to reduce the
problem to quadrature.  With triaxial ellipsoids the problem become a
*lot* harder (and therefore more interesting).  There was considerable
excitement when Jacobi solved this problem with a "remarkable"
substitution, see

   http://books.google.com/books?id=RbwGAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA309
   http://books.google.com/books?id=Rh8GAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA267

If you google this problem you will see that this is still an active
area.  Finally, I will note that Weierstrass treats the triaxial problem
in the geodetic context in

   http://books.google.com/books?id=9O4GAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA257

But perhaps, that's just because his funding source was tied to military
objectives (and he was basically conning his sponsors)?

This seems to have been removed in trunk so the next proj.4 release
shouldn't have it.

My calculation was very much a "back-of-the-envelope" one comparing the
rough order of magnitude of the triaxial term relative to the others.
It's most likely that the other papers you cite give more accurate
results (but I haven't checked these papers!).

Hello Melita!

Oh, and I already disliked EPSG's variant C for Polar Stereographic. 
I hadn't noticed that there is now a variant C for Mercator, too. 

I agree that they will cause confusion. It is true that they
simplify the few CRS instances where they are used, but
these can be emulated by adjusting the FalseNorthing for
a variant A or B instance instead. And the mere existence of a 
variant C option probably confuses people who don't need it.

> Esri currently supports variant B and the Spherical version

In other words, an ESRI Mercator cannot have a scale_factor?
That means that the ESRI WKT at 

       http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3001/esriwkt/

is wrong.
The result of calling 

       gdalsrsinfo -p -o wkt_esri "epsg:3001"

is also wrong, but in a different way (the scale_factor of 0.997 is replaced
by a standard_parallel_1 as it should be, but the standard parallel value
is 0.0 instead of 4.45405154589751).
      I know Frank et al. have put a great effort into ESRI WKT morphing,
but the task is clearly gigantic.

      So, what's that status of the ESRI branch of GDAL that I've heard 
about? I assume it is a branch of GDAL that is distributed with ESRI
software. Are there any plans to merge the ESRI morphing of this
branch into the GDAL trunk?  

(And top-posting makes journalistic sense: new stuff first.)

(yes, I know I'm top-posting and that it's not customary for the mailing list)

This may only get more confusing with the new EPSG Mercator and Stereographic variants. Currently, there are 4 Mercator variants (ignoring false easting/northing and easting/northing at false origin):

Mercator (Spherical)

  Latitude of natural origin
  Longitude of natural origin

Mercator (variant A) aka 1SP

  Latitude of natural origin (must equal zero)
  Longitude of natural origin
  Scale factor at natural origin

Mercator (variant B)

  Latitude of 1st standard parallel
  Longitude of natural origin

Mercator (variant C)

  Latitude of 1st standard parallel
  Longitude of natural origin
  Latitude of false origin

Esri currently supports variant B and the Spherical version indirectly through Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere) or by using a sphere-based geographic CRS. Esri wants "Central Meridian" and "Standard Parallel 1". Internally, we use an array to store parameters. SP1 and LatOfOrigin use different slots so it wouldn't work by chance either.

I don't know of any references to help you on this specific question.  I
suggest either looking at the relevant coefficients in the EGM2008
gravity model, or, in order to incorporate the zeta-to-N correction,
compute the needed spherical harmonic components of the geoid height
directly.

Regarding Charles Karney's point (1) below, there are Mean Sea Surface 
models available.  DTU10 is a recent MSS from Denmark.  Follow the link 
below to research/download:

http://www.space.dtu.dk/English/Research/Scientific_data_and_models/Global_Mean_sea_surface.aspx

The difference between the (level) geoid and the (non-level) MSS is Dynamic 
Ocean Topography (DOT).

Well, not necessarily!!  Higher order interpolation will more faithfully
follow the spherical harmonic model of the geoid.  However most people
who use geoid heights are merely doing vertical datum shifts; and then
you need to ask how others are doing the interpolation.  (For example, I
was recently tasked with creating bare-earth DEMs from lidar data with
the lidar z being height over the ellipsoid and and the DEM being
referenced to EGM96.  However, I was required to use the 15' grid +
bilinear interpolation for EGM96 in order to conform to what others were
doing.)

It might be worth making a few other remarks about the geoid:

(1) The geoid is not mean sea level.  MSL includes local topographic
effects due to currents and the shape of the sea bed.  Marine charts
obvious will need to account for these (and they include tidal effects
with mean low tides or whatever).

(2) The normal to geoid does not give you the direction of gravity on
land.  In calculating the geoid separation, a fudge is added to the
gravity field to account for the mass of the terrain above the geoid
(the zeta-to-N correction).

(3) The NGA code which computes the EGM2008 uses different masses for
the real earth and reference ellipsoid.  This leads to a 1/r effect
which is ignored.  (There is an additional bug in the code which affects
the calculation of the deflection from the normal.  I've pointed this
out to the authors --- and gotten no response!)

(4) If you're really interested in the gravity field then use the
EGM2008 gravity model (or more recent models) directly.  If working with
sensitive equipment,  you might need to account for the mass of the
atmosphere (included in EGM2008!), the buoyancy of your instruments,
earth and ocean tides, etc.

It's best to view the geoid height as "just" a datum shift.  It's
computed to approximate a surface of constant potential and the whole
procedure has various warts.  But these defects don't matter as long as
you make clear what geoid model you used and how you interpolated into
it.

is there any experience about how this DTU10 is accepted by people and how
wide its usage is? I am assuming that most people think that what is printed
on the mountain elevation signs must be the truth. - The question is what is
the surface that is most accepted as any local MSL? (geoid or DTU10 or

Janne,

The MSS models have academic uptake and they're creeping into the oil 
industry, which is my bailiwick.  Follow the links below for DOTs of the 
North Sea and the Gulf of Mexico:

http://www.hydrometronics.com/downloads/DOT_NS.png
http://www.hydrometronics.com/downloads/DOT_GOM.png

You'll see that the differences between the geoid and the MSS are not 
insignificant, nor is the gradient insignificant in places.

Actually the difference between the geoid and the MSS is the Mean Dynamic
Topography (MDT), cf. e.g. http://www.dgfi.badw.de/index.php?id=333

(the MDT is the long term mean of the DOT, primarily resolving large scale
ocean currents)

Thank you Charles for the suggestions, could you please say whether I'm right stating that "there is no difference in longitude of principal axes orientation between the triaxial Earth ellipsoid and the (3,2) (third degree second order zonal harmonics) Earth figure (triaxial + pear shaped) ?"

I'm not sure why Y[3,2] comes into the triaxial axes.  This is
determined by the Y[2,2] component.  Perhaps you're saying that
the phases of these terms happen to agree?  But that is then a
question of looking at the data.

Probably my description was unclear (or wrong?). I just want to add to Y[2,2]  geoid approximation (triaxial ellipsoid) one extra term (3,0) so that the result would be triaxial + pear shaped Earth figure (and then to calculate it's principal axes orientation).

Surely, the Y[3,m] terms won't change the axes since they don't
contribute to the moment of inertia.

On rereading your original question about the (3,m) terms, perhaps
I'm just agreeing with you...?

But my original statement concerned the difference only in the longitude of the principal axes orientation.
