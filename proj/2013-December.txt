Subject: [Proj] NTv2 nested grid issues (Issue #177)
Message-ID: <1561860885.1735293.1385932610087.JavaMail.root@s124-0006-lnv02>

Hi

I've just struck the problem with NTv2 grids with nested subgrids of arbitrary depth.  This was noted in issue #177 from 18 months ago, though I think the proposed fix there is not completely correct.

I've submitted a patch against this issue.  Is there any chance this could be include in 4.9 please?

Thanks
Chris

Subject: [Proj] Converting DMS coordinates to DD using PyProj
Message-ID: <529BB341.5070405@laposte.net>

Hi all,

i'd like to convert places coordinates displayed here to the more 
convenient decimal degrees format:
http://www.cayenne.ird.fr/aublet2/aff_plateau.php3?plateau=Guyane+fran%E7aise

I used to do this kind of processing using regular expressions and the 
cs2cs command:
echo "52d08'11.70W 04d38'53.90N \"Mare aux Caimans\"" | cs2cs -f "%.6f" 
+init=epsg:4624 +to +init=epsg:4326

 From Python, is it possible to achieve this using PyProj?


Thanks in advance,

Adrien

Hi all,

I submitted a patch a couple of years ago to correct the newly added option to the geos projection, but somehow it didn't make it into 4.8.

Is there something I can do to make it into 4.9 ?

Both code and unit tests are updated in the patch that is attached to ticket #146.

Best regards,
Martin

Subject: [Proj] Mingw JNI build issue
Message-ID: <1386792840902-5093816.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hi all,

I've successfully built Proj.4 with JNI support on my OSX machine and am
attempting to do the same under Mingw64 and MSYS on Windows 7 64bit. I can
build the normal DLL ok (configure, make, make install). However as soon as
I enable the JNI options I get some errors, which I kind of understand
(excuse me I'm a Java programmer at heart!) but am a little lost in
resolving.

The error is at the end of "Make" and is this:

/bin/sh ../libtool --tag=CC   --mode=link x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc 
-I/java/include/win32/   -o proj.exe proj.o gen_cheb.o p_series.o libproj.la
-lm libtool: link: x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -I/java/include/win32/ -o
.libs/proj.exe proj.o gen_cheb.o p_series.o  ./.libs/libproj.dll.a
-L/usr/local/lib
proj.o:proj.c:(.text+0xf0): undefined reference to `emess_dat'
proj.o:proj.c:(.text+0xf9): undefined reference to `emess_dat'
proj.o:proj.c:(.text+0x3b7): undefined reference to `pj_factors'
proj.o:proj.c:(.text+0x437): undefined reference to `pj_factors'
proj.o:proj.c:(.text+0x54d): undefined reference to `rtodms'

and so on.. there's a number of "undefined reference" complaints... 

As it compiles fine without the JNI support there's a clue here somewhere,
but I'm stumped if I can get to the bottom of it!

My configure command is:

CFLAGS=-I/java/include/win32 ./configure --with-jni=/java/include/
--host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --build=x86_64-w64-mingw32

Configure correctly finds the JNI headers and enables everything so far as I
can tell..

This is happens with the latest SVN checkout and the zip 4.8.0 download.

Help? 

Many Thanks

Mark

Subject: [Proj] Computing geodesics with Matlab;
	accuracy of spherical distances.
Message-ID: <52ADDB88.90609@sri.com>

About a year ago, I released a native Matlab implementation of the
geodesic algorithms in GeographicLib.  The standalone package is
available here:

   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39108

This works with Octave and Matlab.  The solution is vectorized; solving
1000000 inverse problems in parallel takes a few seconds on my home
machine.

This capability allow you to extend Tobler's 1964 paper

   http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0033-0124.1964.009_q.x

comparing spherical and ellipsoidal distances.  For example, a rather
accurate way of estimating the ellipsoidal distance is to transfer the
problem to a sphere of radius (2*a+b)/3 with the spherical latitude set
to

     atan((1-f)^(3/2)*tan(phi))

(which is roughly the rectifying latitude).  The RMS relative error in
the distance is 0.05% and the max relative error is 0.11% (WGS84
ellipsoid).  The following short Matlab program illustrates
this result

     ell=defaultellipsoid;                   % WGS84
     m=1000000;                              % number of points
     % sample points uniformly
     lat1=asind(2*rand(m,1)-1); lon1=180*(2*rand(m,1)-1);
     lat2=asind(2*rand(m,1)-1); lon2=180*(2*rand(m,1)-1);
     % the ellipsoidal distance
     sell=geoddistance(lat1,lon1,lat2,lon2,ell);
     % the mean sphere
     a=ell(1); f=ecc2flat(ell(2)); b=a*(1-f); sph=[(2*a+b)/3,0];
     p=1.5;                                  % convert the latitude
     mu1=atand((1-f)^p*tand(lat1)); mu2=atand((1-f)^p*tand(lat2));
     % the spherical distance
     ssph=geoddistance(mu1,lon1,mu2,lon2,sph);
     err=(ssph-sell)./sell;                  % the relative error
     100*[sqrt(mean(err(:).^2)),max(abs(err(:)))]

If the geographic latitude is used (set p=0 above), the errors are RMS =
0.18%, max = 0.56%.  (Note that Tobler gives too optimistic an estimate
of the error because he only uses 27 pairs of points in his tests,
instead of 1000000 used here.)

Hello,

well, that is exactly what the proj.4 is created for .. you just
read all the documentation etc. and you should be able
to do it!

There is no short cut ... except if you find some
open source code somewhere in the net ... which you
anyway have to usually modify.

Best luck! Janne.

Here is a candidate:

GRASS GIS m.cogo - A simple utility for converting bearing and distance
measurements to coordinates and vice versa.It assumes a cartesian
coordinate system
http://grass.osgeo.org/grass70/manuals/m.cogo.html

It is PROJ.4 based of course...

And here is another one:

http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/TOOLS/Inv_Fwd/Inv_Fwd.html
http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/PC_PROD/Inv_Fwd/

which implements the Vincenty algorithm (you want the "forward" 
version). It's in Fortran IIRC, and does not have any special handling 
for nearly antipodal points (so gives incorrect results for those cases).

Proj includes the geod command line utilities for this
http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/man_geod

You might need to use the proj utility to get your coordinates into a form that geod wants
http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/man_proj

Geographiclib also has standalone and web tools todo this

Proj 4.9.0 will use improved algorithms for geodesics (the same as those
in GeographicLib) and will expose an API for these calculations.  See

   http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/C/geodesic_8h.html

for documentation.  A beta release of this version of Proj.4 is
available at

Siva,

I believe you want to use the "geod" program distributed with PROJ.4.  The
man page, possibly a bit out of date is at:

  http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/man_geod

Example use:
$ geod +ellps=WGS84

Input:
33 -117 15 10000

Output:
33d5'13.53"N 116d58'20.2"W -164d59'5.581"

So if you gave it an initial location of 33N 117W, an azimuth(bearing) of
15 degrees and a distance 10000m you would arrive at the output location
given with the third value being the azimuth back to the original point.

You should be able to construct what you want from this.

There is also a corresponding C API.

Best regards,
Frank

Quick question- 


having had a very similar discussion on the Postgis list regarding ST_Project()

does geod propagate a straight line at constant bearing, or a great circle arc, to locate the new point?

looking at these examples (the first gives a slightly different return azimuth to Frank's example for some reason):

echo "33 -117 15 10000" | geod +ellps=WGS84
33d5'12.363"N¬†¬†¬† 116d58'20.1"W¬†¬†¬† -164d59'5.527"


echo "33 -117 90 10000" | geod +ellps=WGS84
32d59'59.835"N¬†¬†¬† 116d53'34.398"W¬†¬†¬† -89d56'29.986"


echo "33 -117 90 1000000" | geod +ellps=WGS84
32d32'41.22"N¬†¬†¬† 106d19'31.529"W¬†¬†¬† -84d12'35.763"


given the changes in return azimuth & latitude I'm assuming the azimuth given on the command line is not the constant bearing to the point, but the start bearing of a great circle arc crossing that point.



Thanks

¬† Brent Wood

geod computes the geodesic (see the man page).  It's probably not a good
idea to call it a great circle (unless you're specifying a sphere).  The
result Frank quotes is from proj 4.9.0 which provides a more accurate
result than earlier versions of proj.4.

Subject: [Proj] Map projection of Portugal
Message-ID: <CALHLaOSDza9Ec3N4++gGvhjigXSMrY7JGGSTEcLPXUsnvoiQTg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear members of the list

I would like to put some questions related to map projections being used in
Europe. Most of the European countries are now using map coordinate systems
based on the ETRS89 datum. The Portuguese Geographical Institute has
adopted in 2006, for the continental Portugal, a projection, called
‚ÄúPT-TM06‚Äù (EPSG code 3763), similar to the ones used before with older
geodetic datums (Datum Lisboa and Datum 73). It has, in my opinion, some
annoying characteristics that make users loose time, and even make errors
with costly consequences.

The projection is a transverse Mercator, with a central point in the centre
of the country, no scale change, i.e. k_0=1, and no false easting/northing,
so coordinates can be positive or negative. Some old coordinate systems in
other countries also had the origin inside the country or region, but I
think that now, most of them do not have this situation. So, my first
question is if anyone knows of map coordinate systems in use, for
topographic surveying and cadastre, which have negative coordinates.

The second bad aspect of our new coordinate system is that, being the
projection similar to the older ones, coordinates are also very similar.
Differences are in general smaller than 6 meters, so when one looks at a
coordinate pair it is not obvious if it is EPSG:3763 or older systems
(datum 73, EPSG:27493 or datum Lisboa, EPSG:20791). For many years people
will have to deal with data in the older systems, so making mistakes
becomes very easy. The reasonable approach would have been to add a big
shift so that coordinates are not mistaken, as I think most countries do.
This leads to my second question: does anyone know of similar situations of
very close coordinate systems?
I know that in Belgium a projection was established for ETRS89 (Belge 2005,
EPSG:3447) which had coordinates similar to an older system (EPSG:31300).
Meanwhile a new system was defined with new false easting/northing (Belge
2008, EPSG:3812). Was the change motivated by users?

Regards and a happy new year

Jos√©,



Plane coordinate systems comprised of quadrants with plus & minus signs associated with coordinate components were common in Europe and many European colonies in the 19th century and some hold-overs remained during the first half of the 20th century.  With regard to the "Great War," (WWI), the French Kilometric Quadrillage used specifically in the Nord de Guerre Zone of Northern France and Belgium was the primary inspiration for the American series of the State Plane Coordinate Systems.  After WWII, projection tables were published for all of the American states and territories specifically for the land aeras.  Little thought was given to developing geodetic plane coordinate systems for offshore areas of American territorial waters.



Metal welding technologies advanced such that stiff-leg platforms were fabricated and moved offshore into the Gulf of Mexico to enable oil exploration and production activities.  Over time, the platforms started being emplaced further and further offshore.  Eventually, the offshore lease blocks began being used that were far south of the False Origin of the Louisiana South (1702) Zone, and from time-to-time Licensed Surveyors would "forget" the minus sign on the Y-coordinate and the platform would be placed exactly on the X-coordinate but 20 miles or so too far north of the intended location.  The economic consequences were disasterous for all concerned, as one would expect.



The use of GPS for precise positioning offshore seems to have alleviated that problem.



Minus signs on coordinates and humans don't seem to mix very well.
