Hey,

My northing numbers are way off, so I must be doing something wrong.

I want to convert lat/long to the following coordinate system:

PROJCS["NAD_1983_StatePlane_New_Hampshire_FIPS_2800_Feet",
GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",
DATUM["D_North_American_1983",
SPHEROID["GRS_1980", 6378137.0, 298.257222101]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],
PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
PARAMETER["False_Easting",984250.0],
PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],
PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-71.66666666666667],
PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.9999666666666667],
PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",42.5],
UNIT["Foot_US",0.3048006096012192]]

I am initializing proj as follows:

proj +proj=tmerc +lat_0=42.5 +lon_0=-71.66666666666667 +k=0.9999666666666667 +x_0=984250.0 +y_0=0 +Units=Foot_US

I have a spot in SE New Hampshire, along the southern border with Massachusetts, close to the SE corner:

-71.32228851666666 42.69722980277778

If you give 42.69722980277778, -71.32228851666666 to http://maps.google.com/, it will show you a spot in New Hampshire (but gives a closest address in Massachusetts just across the border, no big deal).

>From a shape file that I got from New Hampshire, the bounding box is as follows:

745473.8751627404, 72029.90624999696, 1242053.0000937672, 1023283.999999998

(The coordinate system info above is from the prj file.)

So for a spot near the southern border, I am expecting a northing close to 72030 (72,030), but I am getting 21966.03 (21,966).

My easting numbers are closer but not right on.

(I am using proj rel. 4.7.1, 23 September 2009, which came with ubuntu 12.04.)

If someone can see what I am doing wrong, I would appreciate some guidance.

Thanks,

Rick Graves

Hey,

Sorry to trouble you, but I still have a couple of states for which I need to get proj.4 working. Â This time, it is Wisconsin.

I am starting with the Western most point in the state. Â If you plug the following into maps.google.com, you will see it:

45.64120292600006, -92.88943290699996Â 

I downloaded the shapefiles from the state web site. Â In the shapefile, the minimum X point is this:

294822.7664999999, 578184.1052999999

Here is the metadata from the prj file:

PROJCS["NAD_1983_HARN_Wisconsin_TM",
GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983_HARN",
DATUM["D_North_American_1983_HARN",
SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],

PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-90.0],
PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.9996],
PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",0.0],
UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

I initialized proj as follows:

proj +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0.0 +lon_0=-90.0 +k=0.9996 +x_0=-4480000.0 +y_0=520000.0

When give proj this:Â 

-92.88943290699996 45.64120292600006

I get this:

-4705175.18 Â  Â  5578245.14

But I am expecting this:

294822.7664999999, 578184.1052999999

I assume I am not initializing proj correctly. Â 

If someone could spot my mistake, I would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Rick Graves

Hello Rick,
I think you have just switched the values of x_0 and y_0, since x_0 should be False_Easting and y_0 should be False_Northing.

With Proj 4.8.0, I get

C:\Windows\System32>proj +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-90 +k=0.9996 +y_0=-4480000.0 +x_0=520000.0 -v

#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-90 +k=0.9996 +y_0=-4480000.0 +x_0=520000.0
# +ellps=WGS84

-92.88943290699996 45.64120292600006

294824.82       578245.14

which is at least near your expected result. (Maybe I made some other mistake.)

I would prefer to give the +ellps explicitly, but the default seems to be what you need, or nearly so.
(Not much difference between the WGS84 and the GRS_1980 ellipsoid.)

And I think +k_0 is now the recommended parameter name instead of +k, but it seems that +k still works.

Subject: [Proj] proj4 specifications for a rotated latlon grid on a sphere?
Message-ID: <50291AF5.6090207@ifg.uni-tuebingen.de>

Dear PROJ4 users,

I have a rotated latitude-longitude grid with coordinates of the north 
pole POLE_LAT=39.25 and POLE_LON=-162.
The data are on a sphere with radius 6371 km. Is it possible to define 
proj4 specifications for this grid, so that I can make
coordinate transformations? Most interesting for me would be how to 
specify the towgs84 parameter.

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Best regards,

Dear users of PROJ,

I have a data set on a perfect sphere with radius 6371 km. The "projection"
is latitude-longitude, so the data practically are unprojected.

I need to transform the coordinates of the points in my data set from the sphere
to WGS84. For that purpose I need the +towgs84 parameters for my sphere, which I
do not know. Does someone have a clue how to get these parameters?

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Best regards,

Martin

I need to convert the coordinates of the points in my data set from this

Subject: [Proj] proj4 specifications for a rotated latlon grid on a
 sphere?

Hello Martin. 
In some GIS software, it would indeed be possible to rotate
a graticule via +towgs84 parameters with huge rotations.
But I think Proj.4 (like most GIS software) uses a simplified,
linearized implementation of the rotations, assuming they
are small (up to 5 or perhaps 10 arc seconds).

But you can rotate a graticule on a sphere by using Proj.4
twice. Let's try it for the point lat = 80, lon = 0 on the rotated
grid. First, project to an auxiliary stereographic grid:

>proj +proj=stere +lon_0=0 +lat_0=90 +a=6371000 +b=6371000

0    80

0.00    -1114780.55

Next, inverse project back to long/lat using a _different_
instance of stereographic:

>proj +proj=stere -I +lon_0=-162 +lat_0=39.25 +a=6371000 +b=6371000

0.00    -1114780.55

162dW    29d15'N

That's the corresponding long/lat on the plain graticule. 
(I haven't tested if this works on or near the south poles
 of the graticules.)

I have assumed that the prime meridian (zero longitude) of
the rotated graticule goes south from the rotated north pole.
If it doesn't, you can model its direction by changing the
value of lon_0 to something non-zero in the first definition. 

It may be possible to chain the forward and inverse
projection together into a single command line by using
a pipe, but I don't remember the syntax for that.

Martin,
I am sorry, but the best you can do is to ask the data provider, not us. 

However, if the data is meteorological, I am pretty sure that
you should do nothing at all to convert to WGS84 long/lat. 

For other kinds of data, some transformation may be needed,
perhaps converting from geocentric to geodetic latitude. But
only your own data provider can tell you what you must do.

Mikael,

>Â I think you have just switched the values of x_0 and y_0, since x_0 should be False_Easting and y_0 should be False_Northing.

How could I make such a mistake!

I appreciate your help.

Also, I will go with +k_0.

Thanks,

Rick

Hello Rick,
I think you have just switched
the values of x_0 and y_0, since x_0 should be False_Easting and y_0 should be
False_Northing.
Â 
With Proj 4.8.0, I get
Â

Â 
which is at least near
your expected result. (Maybe I made some other mistake.) 
Â 
I would prefer to give
the +ellps explicitly, but the default seems to be what you need, or nearly so. 
(Not much difference
between the WGS84 and the GRS_1980 ellipsoid.) 
Â 
And I think +k_0 is now
the recommended parameter name instead of +k, but it seems that +k still works.

Suppose you have a point A on the sphere, in regular (lat,lon) coordinates.  Let point N be your north pole, and P be your "new" north pole.

Compute the azimuthal distance from P to A.  This is your new latitude.  Look up the Haversine formula.

To get your new longitude: you will need to measure the angle between your line from P to A, versus some reference great circle.  I do not have the time to figure that one out right now.  But I'm sure a little research on Wikipedia can do it.  Remember that a great circle can be specified by the vector (point on the sphere) perpindicular to it.  For example, the equator is specified by the point at the north pole.

Proj.4 isn't really the appropriate tool for what you want.

Dear users of PROJ,

I have a data set on a perfect sphere with radius 6371 km. The "projection"
is latitude-longitude, so the data practically are unprojected.

I need to convert the coordinates of the points in my data set from this
latlon projection to another latlon projection of the same sphere. The target
latlon projection is rotated, it has its north pole at 39.25 latitude and -162
longitude. Is there a way to make the conversion with proj?

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Best regards,

Martin

That's interesting, Hermann, I didn't know about ob_tran. 

After some googling, I found an older post, also by you, where
you also used the flag

    -m 57.2957795130823

which seems to be needed to get degrees instead of radians.

See 

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2011-October/005906.html

and

and also

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2010-June/005234.html


On the related topic, here is a reference saying that meteorological
long/lat data on a sphere needs no datum shift to WGS84:

Hello Martin, in principle this should be a job for proj's ob_tran 
transformation

ob_tran : General Oblique Transformation
         Misc Sph
         o_proj= plus parameters for projection
         o_lat_p= o_lon_p= (new pole) or
         o_alpha= o_lon_c= o_lat_c= or
         o_lon_1= o_lat_1= o_lon_2= o_lat_2=

but I am afraid that the way the parameters are to be fed to proj is 
different from the convention used in meteorological gridded data that I 
suppose you are using, there was some past discussion here:

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2010-June/005234.html
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2011-October/005913.html

please report on any success. Anyway the idea proposed by Mikael may be 
a good workaround which is worth tesating,

A decent datum transformation program should be able to transform from 
ellipsoid-ellipsoid, ellipsoid-sphere, sphere-ellipsoid, sphere-sphere. I 
don't know if PROJ.4 can do this, but it should not be too difficult to 
implement this in the code.

A transform from spherical to ellipsoidal coordinates is not necessary for 
some kinds of data, like meteorological data?

Hmm..... let's take a test point, say lat=50d; lon=10d; h=120m; on the 
Normal Sphere with a (rounded) radius of 6371000 meters. If I transform this 
to the WGS84 ellipsoid with translations 0, rotations 0, scaling factor 0, 
then I get the coordinates:
lat'=50.1892244; lon'=10; h'=5558.1 m.
I should say that about 5.4 km height difference and around 21 km difference 
in northerly direction (with respect to the WGS84 ellipsoid) is quite 
significant.
Possibly a bit too much to ignore, even for meteo applications.

I'd argue a "transform from spherical to ellipsoidal coordinates is not 
necessary for some kinds of data, like meteorological data" because a 
spherical earth is a fiction.  A spherical model may be used for databases 
or processing simplicity (ignorantly, IMHO), but it's impossible that 
meteorological (or any other) data finding its way into the database is 
based upon a sphere.  Where would that spherical data come from?  Not GPS. 
So, the way to undo this ignorance is to treat (so-called) spherical data as 
ellipsoidal and not apply any datum shift.  Two wrongs in this case make a 
right (well, almost, because the audit trail suffers).  -Noel

lat'=50.1892244; lon'=10; h'=5558.1 m.
I should say that about 5.4 km height difference and around 21 km difference
in northerly direction (with respect to the WGS84 ellipsoid) is quite
significant.
Possibly a bit too much to ignore, even for meteo applications.

Well, I could be wrong, but I think that meteorologists locate their 
sensors, and thus the sensor data, by ordinary WGS84 long/lat (not
sure about the kind of height).  Then, what they say is roughly, 

"Okay, let's all pretend that these long/lat (and height) 
 values refer to a perfect sphere with radius = 6371 km." 

Then, they can use spherical projections (like Web Mercator) and
do whatever computations they want on a sphere. Distances computed
on this sphere will vary by up to +/- 0.5 percent from true distances
on Earth, but I don't think they care. 

The 21 km displacement you mention is what the meteorologists 
would get if they their long/lat values really did refer to a
true sphere of radius 6371 km, georeferenced by GPS for example,
but I don't think that's what they do.

Dear users of PROJ,

I have a data set on a perfect sphere with radius 6371 km. The "projection"
is latitude-longitude, so the data practically are unprojected.

I need to transform the coordinates of the points in my data set from the 
sphere
to WGS84. For that purpose I need the +towgs84 parameters for my sphere, 
which I
do not know. Does someone have a clue how to get these parameters?

Any suggestions will be appreciated.

Best regards,

Martin



Reply:

A decent datum transformation program should be able to transform from 
ellipsoid-ellipsoid, ellipsoid-sphere, sphere-ellipsoid, sphere-sphere. I 
don't know if PROJ.4 can do this, but it should not be too difficult to 
implement this in the code.

A transform from spherical to ellipsoidal coordinates is not necessary for 
some kinds of data, like meteorological data?

Hmm..... let's take a test point, say lat=50d; lon=10d; h=120m; on the 
Normal Sphere with a (rounded) radius of 6371000 meters. If I transform this 
to the WGS84 ellipsoid with translations 0, rotations 0, scaling factor 0, 
then I get the coordinates:
lat'=50.1892244; lon'=10; h'=5558.1 m.
I should say that about 5.4 km height difference and around 21 km difference 
in northerly direction (with respect to the WGS84 ellipsoid) is quite 
significant.

Hi Again,

I am struggling to locate a copy of the NTv2 file for Clarke 1880 Cape 
Datum to WGS84

I have not had any luck with either Google, or the contacts mentioned in 
the article pointed to (below) by Mikael, so please could someone give 
me a link to download from, or perhaps send it to me via 
transferbigfiles.com or similar method.

I have no idea how big, or what extents are in these NTv2 grid files, as 
I have never used them before.

To this end, my area of interest is in Maputo (Mozambique), and 
Mozambique apparently uses Clarke 1866 (not 1880) - but the surveyor 
"swears blind" that the coords are on "1880" and not "1866".

This begs the question:
Do the extents of this Clarke 1880 NTv2 grid stop at the South African 
border (some 50Km west of my area of interest), or do they cover Maputo 
sufficiently?


Thanks & kind regards,
Zoltan

Indeed, I forgot to mention this switch. Sorry.

 From my .bash_history, I see that I have also been using:

Zoltan,



All of the MoÃ§ambican borders were surveyed by British Royal Engineers in the early 1900's and therefore ONLY the borders are on the Cape Datum, Clarke 1880 ellipsoid.  In regards to the interior of the of the country, all native classical triangulation was indeed referenced to the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid for the Tete Datum of 1960, the Madzansua Datum of 1904, and the Observatorio Campo Rodriques Datum of 1907.



The "Arc of the 30th Meridian Survey" did not touch the country.



In 1995, Norway Mapping did a comprehensive readjustment of the country called MOZNET/ITRF94.



As of September 1999 when I wrote my Grids & Datums column on the country, no geoid had been computed for the country.  Your best bet is likely EGM96 or a variant thereof for a guess of the geoid there.

... which was re-observed in 2011  by a MoÃ§ambique/Portuguese mission (I participated on it) but don't know if the results are already available.

Be aware that there are large differences (~1 meter) between EGM96 and EGM2008 solutions in the central part of MoÃ§ambique. I had a paper where that is clearly shown but don't find it anymore.

Thank you all very much for your replies. I tried the suggestion of 
Herman Peifer and it worked perfectly.
The only thing is, as Herman has already noted, that to get get the 
coordinates in the rotated grid one has to use
invproj, and to get the coordinates back to longlat one has to use proj.

Best regards

Hey,

The good news is that Oregon is the last one I need to get working. Â The bad news is I do not have it working yet.

Here is the metadata from the .prj that I got from the state:

PROJCS["NAD_1983_Oregon_Statewide_Lambert_Feet_Intl",
GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",
DATUM["D_North_American_1983",
SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],
PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic"],
PARAMETER["False_Easting",1312335.958005249],
PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],
PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-120.5],
PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_1",43.0],
PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_2",45.5],
PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",41.75],
UNIT["Foot",0.3048]],
VERTCS["NAD_1983",
DATUM["D_North_American_1983",
SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],
PARAMETER["Vertical_Shift",0.0],
PARAMETER["Direction",1.0],

I initialized proj as follows:

proj +proj=lcc +lon_0=-120.5 +lat_0=41.75 +lat_1=43.0 +lat_2=45.5 +x_0=1312335.958005249 +y_0=0.0 +units=ft

I assume something is not right.

In http://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/, I picked the Eastern most point in the state, 45.614818, -116.463726, and verified in maps.goole.com.

From the state's shape file, I picked the point touching the bounding box on the Eastern side, 1005007.55709, 1323046.51837 (1,005,007, 1,323,046), so these are the numbers I am expecting from proj.

When I give this to proj,Â 

-116.463726 45.614818

I get:

5338087.78 1434192.31 (5,338,087 1,434,192)

As you can see, my numbers are not close.

I would be grateful if someone would help me initialize proj correctly.

Thanks,

Rick Graves

I think there are two things wrong:
1. Your false easting is here given in feet while I believe proj always
wants meters.  The number is about 400000m.  (See
http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms).
2. You didn't include an ellipsoid or datum so I'm surprised that proj
worked at all since I get an error without +datum=NAD83 or +ellps=GRS80.

However, correcting both of those, I get  X=2344859.57 ft, Y=1434192.31 ft,
which isn't what you want either.

Now I want to know what I am missing!  Let's hope someone cleverer than me
answers.

Carl,
In fact, I don't think you are missing anything.

I made a quick back-of-an-envelope calculation - not using
proj, just a plain calculator - starting with the projection
origin, assuming 111120 meters per degree of latitude,
and 111120 * cos(lat) meters per degree of longitude.

For the test point, I got

Easting = 1408985 ft
Northing = 2341613 ft.

That's close enough to your (Carl's) result, with my simple method.

I may have made a mistake, but Rick: could you double-check your expected coordinates - I am pretty sure they are wrong.

Mikael Rittri

Mikael and Carl,

Maybe there is a problem with the Oregon shape files, or maybe I made an incorrect assumption about the contents.

The Oregon redistricting web site is down for me at the moment:

www.leg.state.or.us/redistricting/

But the Oregon shape files are available here:

http://www.srrproject.org/resources/redistricting-shapefiles/


(Click on Oregon to get the link. Â If you do not instantly know which one is Oregon, you can hover the mouse and a tip will display telling which state is under the pointer. Â Oregon is on the West coast just North of California.)

The zip for Oregon includes two sets of files,Â Congressional_Districts.* and Congressional_Area_Changes.*.Â 

I assumed that I should go with the latter file.

I ran diff against the two .prj files, and there is no difference.

However, I just now discovered that the contents of the shapefiles are radically different. Â Here are the bounding boxes:

Congressional_Districts

(183987.16863517463, 88653.9580052495, 2345137.542322829, 1677526.0958005222)


Congressional_Area_Changes

(427663.998031497, 172986.72867454588, 1005007.5570866163, 1488902.549212602)


Sorry for being a beginner, but is there something I should know to do with these two files? Â Or should I be asking Oregon what is the deal?

Thanks,

Rick

Rick,
I don't know about the shapefiles, but you could try this Proj.4 definition

  +init=epsg:2992

which I think will be equivalent to Carl's definition.

(I'm not sure how you can verify that it works, but maybe you
can compare the Oregon data location with other data sources.)

Mikael and Carl,

Maybe there is a problem with the Oregon shape files, or maybe I made an incorrect assumption about the contents.

The Oregon redistricting web site is down for me at the moment:

www.leg.state.or.us/redistricting/<http://www.leg.state.or.us/redistricting/>

But the Oregon shape files are available here:

http://www.srrproject.org/resources/redistricting-shapefiles/

(Click on Oregon to get the link.  If you do not instantly know which one is Oregon, you can hover the mouse and a tip will display telling which state is under the pointer.  Oregon is on the West coast just North of California.)

The zip for Oregon includes two sets of files, Congressional_Districts.* and Congressional_Area_Changes.*.

I assumed that I should go with the latter file.

I ran diff against the two .prj files, and there is no difference.

However, I just now discovered that the contents of the shapefiles are radically different.  Here are the bounding boxes:

Congressional_Districts
(183987.16863517463, 88653.9580052495, 2345137.542322829, 1677526.0958005222)

Congressional_Area_Changes
(427663.998031497, 172986.72867454588, 1005007.5570866163, 1488902.549212602)

Sorry for being a beginner, but is there something I should know to do with these two files?  Or should I be asking Oregon what is the deal?

Thanks,

Rick

Carl,
In fact, I don't think you are missing anything.

I made a quick back-of-an-envelope calculation - not using
proj, just a plain calculator - starting with the projection
origin, assuming 111120 meters per degree of latitude,
and 111120 * cos(lat) meters per degree of longitude.

For the test point, I got

Easting = 1408985 ft
Northing = 2341613 ft.

That's close enough to your (Carl's) result, with my simple method.

I may have made a mistake, but Rick: could you double-check your expected coordinates - I am pretty sure they are wrong.

Regards,

Mikael Rittri

Hey,

The good news is that Oregon is the last one I need to get working.  The bad news is I do not have it working yet.

Here is the metadata from the .prj that I got from the state:

PROJCS["NAD_1983_Oregon_Statewide_Lambert_Feet_Intl",
GEOGCS["GCS_North_American_1983",
DATUM["D_North_American_1983",
SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],
UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],
PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic"],
PARAMETER["False_Easting",1312335.958005249],
PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],
PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",-120.5],
PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_1",43.0],
PARAMETER["Standard_Parallel_2",45.5],
PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",41.75],
UNIT["Foot",0.3048]],
VERTCS["NAD_1983",
DATUM["D_North_American_1983",
SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137.0,298.257222101]],
PARAMETER["Vertical_Shift",0.0],
PARAMETER["Direction",1.0],

I initialized proj as follows:

proj +proj=lcc +lon_0=-120.5 +lat_0=41.75 +lat_1=43.0 +lat_2=45.5 +x_0=1312335.958005249 +y_0=0.0 +units=ft

I assume something is not right.



I think there are two things wrong:
1. Your false easting is here given in feet while I believe proj always wants meters.  The number is about 400000m.  (See <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms> http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/GenParms).
2. You didn't include an ellipsoid or datum so I'm surprised that proj worked at all since I get an error without +datum=NAD83 or +ellps=GRS80.

However, correcting both of those, I get  X=2344859.57 ft, Y=1434192.31 ft, which isn't what you want either.

Now I want to know what I am missing!  Let's hope someone cleverer than me answers.

Mikael and Carl,

From the correct shape file, the point touching the bounding box on the Eastern side isÂ 2345137.5423228294, 1430204.1095800549. Â Comparing these with numbers from proj with the lat/long inputs, the easting is within 0.1%, and the northing is within 1%, which I believe is close enough (for points picked from on line maps).

>Â you could try this Proj.4 definition:Â +init=epsg:2992

The following two return the exactly same numbers when I inputÂ -116.463726 45.614818:

proj +proj=lcc +lon_0=-120.5 +lat_0=41.75 +lat_1=43.0 +lat_2=45.5 +x_0=400000 +y_0=0.0 +units=ft


proj +init=epsg:2992


Now I have to figure out how to merge the change file coordinates into the original file!

Thanks for solving the problem!

Rick

Hi All,
This issue goes on, slower than a snail.
I have finally managed to get some source and target points from the 
original surveyor.

BM1

	

2872274.540m

	

49717.410m

	

7128571.659m

	

450273.237m

	

4275103.524m


I load my source image that is on Lo33 Clarke 1880 into QGIS and hover 
the mouse over BM1, a nicely painted white target.
I get:    -49717.33   -2872272.46  which is good on the eastings, but my 
source image is 2m north of this value from the surveyor. For the 
moment, so what.

I then run:
ogr2ogr -f "DGN" -dsco "3D=YES" -s_srs "+proj=tmerc +lon_0=33

My UTM 36S WGS84 coordinate for BM1 is now:
450288.88   and   7128578.76    and this puts my transformed image 15m 
to the east and 7m to the north of the Surveyors value.

My question is:
Did I specify the s_srs and t_srs parameters correctly
Can I be certain that the SA.gsb grid was used?

I have no idea how the original surveyor got his source and target 
values for BM1, as I have no access to this person.

Zoltan

Yes, they go up to 33E which just covers Maputo, and when I load the

Hello Zoltan,

As far as I can see, yes (for what it's worth).

> Can I be certain that the SA.gsb grid was used?

I don't know if there is some tracing or debugging mode of ogr2ogr or gdalwarp that says
whether an NTv2 grid was used, since points outside the grid are silently non-datumshifted
(at least in Proj 4.8.0, I think).

However, for your point, I can verify that it was used:

With cs2cs, I get

> cs2cs +proj=tmerc +lon_0=33 +a=6378249.145 +b=6356514.966398753 +nadgrids=SA.gsb +to +init=epsg:32736

-49717.33 -2872272.46

450288.90 7128578.77 0.00

(when I have SA.gsb in the right directory), which is just a few centimeters from your results.
If I remove the +nadgrids parameter, or use the alaska.gsb instead, I get the result

450303.95 7128642.46 0.00

It is hard to know what's wrong, but maybe the SA.gsb grid shift file is not very accurate outside
South Africa, even though it extends outside the borders. The corrections outside South Africa
may have been computed from extrapolation rather than measurements.

(For example, I have noticed this for the conus grid shift file for NAD27: it has been extrapolated
to cover Cuba but is quite bad there.

So if I use +datum=NAD27, I get the default datum shift +nadgrids=@conus, at alaska, at ntv2_0.gsb, at ntv1_can.dat, and

> cs2cs +proj=longlat +datum=NAD27 +to +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84

-75 20

74d59'57.145"W 20d0'1.783"N 0.000

But if I use a datum shift that is more accurate on Cuba ("NAD27 to WGS 84 (88)", EPSG:15978), I get

> cs2cs +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk66 +towgs84=2.478,149.752,197.726,0.526,0.498,-0.501,0.685 +to +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84

-75 20

74d59'58.961"W 20d0'2.043"N -21.720

Horizontally, these differ by 53.4 meters.)

Anyway, back to Africa. If we don't trust the SA.gsb, we can try with the datum shift "Cape to WGS 84 (2)", EPSG:1129,
from the Directorate of Surveys and Land Information, Cape Town. "Residuals should not exceed 15 metres", says EPSG,
but I think they do.

> cs2cs +proj=tmerc +lon_0=33 +a=6378249.145 +b=6356514.966398753 +towgs84=-134.73,-110.92,-292.66 +to +init=epsg:32736

-49717.33 -2872272.46

450283.06 7128577.97 17.72

Or we can try with the datum shift "Cape to WGS 84 (1)", EPGS:1128, from U.S. Defense Mapping Agency TR8350.2,
September 1987, with accuracy 9 metres (confidence 67 percent, I think).

> cs2cs +proj=tmerc +lon_0=33 +a=6378249.145 +b=6356514.966398753 +towgs84=-136,-108,-292 +to +init=epsg:32736

-49717.33 -2872272.46

450286.20 7128578.80 17.88

Unfortunately, it seems that neither of these would make you very much happier.

As a last resort, if you have more examples of source and target points that are representative for your area of interest,
one could use the SEVENPAR program from Killetsoft to compute a local 3-parameter or 7-parameter transform.

Actually, it is possible to use Proj.4 to compute a local 3-parameter transformation from
your single test point, but I have no idea how accurate it would be for the rest of your data.
By assuming the same height above the ellipsoids for your test point, I get the 3-parameter
transform

    +towgs84=-144.47,-128.70,-288.68

which is tailor-made for your single test point, so:

 > cs2cs +proj=tmerc +lon_0=33 +a=6378249.145 +b=6356514.966398753 +towgs84=-144.47,-128.70,-288.68 +to +init=epsg:32736

 -49717.410    -2872274.540
