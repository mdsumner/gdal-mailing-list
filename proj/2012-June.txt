Done. I merged the trunk from revisions 2190 to 2211 inclusive. Those 
revision goes a little bit before the JNI fixes, since it contains the 
following commit (which I presumed was intended to be in the 4.8 branch):

r2195 | warmerdam | 2012-03-13 23:47:22 +0100 (Mar 13 mar 2012) | 1 ligne
add some missing items of 4.8.0 news

This has the side effect of including also the following commit. I 
presumed that it would not hurt, but we could revert that specific 
commit if it shouldn't go to the 4.8 branch:

r2196 | warmerdam | 2012-03-14 02:27:57 +0100 (Mer 14 mar 2012) | 1 ligne
avoid using macro expansion directly in #include to simplify code

Subject: [Proj] New omerc approximations of Denmark System 34
Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD49391CC848@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello,

I have tried to implement the two Denmark System 34 (S34) projections for Jutland and Zealand.
I managed to approximate Kristensen's rotated Transverse Mercator approximations [1]
by using +proj=omerc with alpha and gamma (new in Proj 4.8.0). Although I have made an
approximation of an approximation, I think the accuracy isn't worse, and possibly slightly
better for Jutland. The main advantage is that one can use Proj.4 directly, without Kristensen's
final rotation of the projected plane, which Proj.4 doesn't support.
     This may be a bit late, since System 34 is no longer recommended, but I post my
definitions here in case someone has a use for them:

System 34 for Jutland:

proj +proj=omerc +lonc=9.46 +lat_0=56.13333333 +x_0=-266906.229 +y_0=189617.957 +k=0.9999537 +alpha=-0.76324 +gamma=0.0 +datum=WGS84

System 34 for Zealand:

proj +proj=omerc +lonc=11.81 +lat_0=55.3333332 +x_0=-118947.024 +y_0=101112.545 +k=0.9999855 +alpha=1.190005 +gamma=0.0 +datum=WGS84

These will give an x-axis going eastward, which gives negative x-coordinates in Denmark,
and a y-axis going northward.  Traditionally, the positive x-axis points westward for these
systems, but I think the x-axis is usually flipped to go east in WMS, for example.

The official claim by KMS is that these coordinate systems are not properly defined
projections, and should be transformed via polynomials from ED50/UTM or ETRS89/UTM
coordinates. So, the polynomials will handle both the map projections and the datum shift [2].

However, in the beginning, the two projections seem to have been designed as some
kind of oblique Mercator projections, both with the central line azimuth near zero, and
with grid north along the oblique central line [3].
The advantage of the oblique central lines is that the grid lines of both systems are nearly
parallel. Indeed, they two coordinate systems nearly coincide, with a maximal difference of
about 60 m. The intention was that the coordinates should be similar to an earlier projection
that covered both Jutland and Zealand, at least similar enough that the same division into
map sheets could be used [4].

So omerc (Hotine oblique Mercator) from WGS84 works fine as an approximation, thanks to
the ability to specify both alpha and gamma separately. The worst errors I have seen, compared
to an official online converter [5], is 33 cm for Jutland and 21 cm for Zealand, but I haven't made
very many tests. However, my implementation for Jutland differs at most 30 cm from Kristensen's,
and my implementation for Zealand differs at most 6 cm from Kristensen's, so his accuracy
estimates should be roughly true for my implementations as well.
Kristensen writes [1]:
    Jutland: average error in x: 11 cm, in y: 14 cm, worst error 48 cm in Skagen.
    Zealand: average error in x: 5 cm, in y: 9 cm, worst error 18 cm.

This is an interesting approximation!
BTW, I haven't seen your reference [5], the online converter.
I believe it is:
http://valdemar.kms.dk/trf/

Furthermore I would like to add that I found at last the original 
polynomials at the Kort og Matrikelstyrelsen (KMS) site.
The KMS conversion tool source code has been put online and the System34 
conversion polynomials can be found in the file tcts_u.c, distributed from:
https://bitbucket.org/KMS/trlib/src/b02ad5890f03/TR_SRC/tcts_u.c
This url will undoubtedly change or disappear, in that case search for:
KMS / trlib
Geodetic transformation library from the National Survey and Cadastre, 
Denmark

You could examine the complete source code, but I noticed that CS-MAP from 
Autodesk has a neat implementation.
Look at:
http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/csmap/sandbox/RFC2/Source/CS_sys34.c
and you'll also need at least:
http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/csmap/sandbox/RFC2/Source/CSsys34KMS.c
plus the KMS file mentioned above.

Also Kai Borre has some sort of an approximation for System34.
See the files:
  s34j2utm.m
  s34s2utm.m
  s452utm.m
  utm2s34j.m
  utm2s34s.m
  utm2s45.m
in the folder:
http://kom.aau.dk/~borre/geodesy/


Hope this info can be of some help to users of DK System34.

Well, I tested out the same code base in with a wrapper for c# in proj4 and
it works fine.  I am going to process it on the server instead.  If anybody
knows why this didn't work in the Proj4 C API, I would still love to know.

Hello,

if I correctly remember there was some special trick to be done with the "longlat" projection
before you could use the output... the long and lat result was divided by the ellipsoid axis
or something... so basically you should do the reverse.. check the source code to find out
more..

According to http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/pj_transform ,

  "geographic locations need to be passed in radians, 
   not decimal degrees, and will be returned similarly."

I haven't heard that this differs between the APIs.

Assuming these are in radians, multiplication by 180/pi gives

Longitude: -102.4357 (decimal degrees)
Latitude: 38.2595

which is in Colorado, but quite near Kansas. I think you didn't
give the projected coordinates of the test point, so I can't
see if the radians-to-degrees conversion is all that is missing.

Greetings,
   We have discovered a bug in the rHEALPix projection that causes lon/lat's in the polar regions to be incorrectly projected if the polar regions are shifted.  I have written detailed documentation on the bug, so please reference this for more information.  I have created a patch that fixes the bug as well as provides the test plan and supporting source.  I have also made available the binaries for running the tests for the HEALPix and rHEALPix projections (64-bit).  To test the bug, I've included the source to a standalone C application with an included script that should compile on a 32-bit or 64-bit system.

Subject: [Proj] Limitation of omerc in Proj 4.8.0: the alpha must point in a
 northish direction
Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD49391F6C99@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello,
I discovered an unexpected behaviour of the new omerc implementation of Proj 4.8.0,
and I want to warn others about it. But I don't think it needs to be fixed, as long as you
are aware of it.

In the old omerc implementation (Proj 4.7.0), you got an error message if alpha was
exactly -90 or 90 degrees. Now, you don't get the error message, but the results are
unreliable. What's more, the results are unreliable unless alpha points in a northish
direction. I mean, alpha values in the open interval -90 to 90 degrees are okay (and
also if you add +/-360 degrees), but not southish values.

Example: the omerc approximation of the Madagascar projection:

>proj +proj=omerc +lat_0=-18.9 +lonc=44.1 +alpha=18.9 +k=0.9995 +x_0=400000 +y_0=800000 +gamma=18.9 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-189,-242,-91 +pm=paris +units=m +no_defs

44.1 -18.9

400000.00       800000.00

This seems to work as expected; the central point in Long/Lat is projected to False Easting
and False Northing.

But let's add 180 degrees to both alpha and gamma. That should effectively be the same
projection, I would think (or possibly rotated 180 degrees around the central point).

>proj +proj=omerc +lat_0=-18.9 +lonc=44.1 +alpha=198.9 +k=0.9995 +x_0=400000 +y_0=800000 +gamma=198.9 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-189,-242,-91 +pm=paris +units=m +no_defs

44.1 -18.9

-4643955.76     -13932189.21

Not what I would expect. As far as I can understand, these weird results appear when alpha
is southish (in the closed interval 90 to 270). The omerc of Proj 4.7.0 did not behave this way.

But as long as you know about it, the behaviour is tolerable. After all, the initial line leaves the
central point in two opposite directions, so you just have to choose the northish one for alpha.
(All predefined omerc instances in the nad/epsg file have a northish alpha, I think.)

I finally got around to playing with this again. Installed Visual Studio C++.
And complied the current proj4 binaries using nmake. I've also installed
MinGW.

I'd like to recompile Eric Millers proj_api.dll VBA linker. Wonder if you
(or anyone) would mind providing instruction on how to use your makefile to
produce the proj_api.dll. Aside from changing the following:

EXTRA_INCLUDES = -I. -I../proj-4.4.7/src
to
EXTRA_INCLUDES = -I. -I../proj-4.8.0/src

--target=i386-mingw32
to
--target=mingw

and removing --mno-cygwin 

I've added the path C:\MinGW\bin as an Environment Variable.

Do I need any other files, or to move any files?
What do I type? mingw32-make ?
Thanks.

Steve,

I haven't used that library for some time. But, if you want to compile it with VC, you don't want to include anything having to do with MINGW.  So, probably a separate Makefile is in order.  VC comes with the NMAKE tool to perform the make operation. But, you'll probably need a few more changes to the makefile.  You might look at the Makefile.vc that ships with proj.4 for an example of how a library is built with VC.  Although, that is probably more complicated than this case warrants.

I've now copied proj.lib and proj_i.lib to c:\MinGW\lib

And from the command prompt
dlltools -U -d proj.def -l libproj_api.a
and put libproj_api.a in c:\MinGW\lib too. Is that right?

But when I type 
MinGW32-make makefile all
I still get errors such as
dllwrap: no export definitions file provided.
Creating one, bur that may not be what you want
loads of undefined references and 
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status.
dllwrap: gcc exited with status 1
mingw32-make: *** [proj_api.dll] Error 1

What have I missed ? please
Many thanks.
