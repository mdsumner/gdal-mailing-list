Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Build problems with GEOTiff and PROJ
Message-ID: <006e01c24245$509c1c60$0b6410ac@broszengineering.com>

I've compiled and installed PROJ.4, built from the latest stable source
using GCC 2.96 on Mandrake 8.2. Install went good, and ldconfig -v shows a
functional link to the library. I went with the default install location,
and added the appropriate path into lib conf:   libproj.so.0 ->
libproj.so.0.3.1

When attempting to build GEOTiff with the --with-proj, the configure script
fails to find the proj libraries. Here's the error, verbatim:

[...]
PROJ_HOME=yes, but either projects.h or libproj.a not found!
checking for pj_init in -lproj... (cached) no
checking for projects.h... (cached) no
[...]

When giving a path to the proj library, I was still unsuccessful. Does
GEOTiff need to be built against the PROJ source? I've been assuming that it
was merely looking for the location of the directory.

Any suggestions on where I might look to remedy this problem?

Regards,
Nathan

Nathan,

The "(cached) no" can result from doing a configure with an old
config.cache around.  I would suggest removing it and seeing if the
problem still remains.

If that still fails, delete config.status again and configure with
"--with-proj=/usr/local" and see if that works.  If not, verify that
you have an installed /usr/local/include/projects.h, and
/usr/local/lib/libproj.a.

Hello, Paul

You will find that the parameters you mentioned, and a host of others, are 
used only with specific projections. The file PROJ.4.3.pdf , Table3, 
defines a number of them in the context of a specific projection. Each 
projection has it's own requirements. I have no idea how complete this list 
is; I suspect it's not complete at all.

Mike

Yes, it is possible including datum transformation:

GaussBoaga fuso Est (Rome40/GB/Zone2) to Lat/Long with datum tranformation:
cs2cs +init=epsg:26592 +towgs84=-225,-65,9 +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84

GaussBoaga fuso Ovest (Rome40/GB/Zone1) with datum transformation"
cs2cs +init=epsg:26591 +towgs84=-225,-65,9 +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84

Hope this helps,

Hi.
Why conversion from Lat\Long to mercator are some different in proj4 and
mapinfo.

int fwd(double &x,double &y)
{
    projUV d;
    d.u=x*DEG_TO_RAD;
    d.v=y*DEG_TO_RAD;
    d=pj_fwd(d,handle);
    if(d.u==HUGE_VAL)
      return -1;
    x=d.u;
    y=d.v;
    return 0;
}

char* v[]={"proj=merc","ellps=WGS84","lon_0=0E"};
int c=sizeof(v)/sizeof(char*);

handle=pj_init(c,v);

x=30.524608;y=50.412181;
fwd(x,y);

I get 
x=3397983.8192243
y=6485018.0866892
but in MapInfo I get 
x=3397798.14
y=6485002.45
so difference between conversion is
dx=185.67
dy=15.63
How can I fix it?

Eugene,

The exact projection definition in MapInfo is quite obscure, by checking
mapinfo.prj and looking at the definitions, i find that MapInfo (6.5) uses
NAD27 datum by default for mercator as opposed of WGS84 you specified to
Proj. You would have to modify mapinfo.prj to change this to WGS84

Unfortunately the documentation for the MapInfo datum definition codes has
become pretty obscure too, here's the only place where i can find it, is
suppose MapBasic documentation might help too.

http://testdrive.mapinfo.com/mapxhelp/map00772.htm
http://testdrive.mapinfo.com/mapxhelp/map00035.htm

Maybe you can check if this solves the puzzle ?

Good luck,

Bart Adriaanse

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] installing datum-shift files on HP-UX
Message-ID: <200208202045.NAA17081@bilby.ucsd.edu>


Gentlemen:

I have installed PROJ 4.4.5 on an HP-Unix system. The install had one
problem: the ASCII datum-shift files in nad were not copied to src/nad
and so were not installed in the /usr/local/share/proj area--so I
moved these files after the regular install, and ran "make install" in src/nad
with no problems. However, there seems to be a hitch in the programs'
finding the datum-shift files: cs2cs only does so on the second and later
coordinate pairs (but then gives the right answer), and nad2nad fails:

	%cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=NAD27 +to +proj=latlong +datum=NAD27
	-117d 30d
	117dW	30dN 0.000

	%cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=NAD27 +to +proj=latlong +datum=NAD83
	-117d 30d
	*	* 0.000
	-117d 30d
	117d0'2.901"W	30d0'0.407"N 0.000

	% nad2nad -i 27 -o 83 -r conus
	Rel. 4.3.3, 23 Sept. 1995
	<nad2nad>: 
	datum file: conus, failed: No such file or directory
	program abnormally terminated

to demonstrate that the files are there, here is an  ls  and the line in
my .cshrc file:

	% ls -l /usr/local/share/proj/co*
	-rw-rw-r--   agnew      264392 Aug  6 21:05 /usr/local/share/proj/conus
	% fgrep PROJ ~/.cshrc
	setenv PROJ_LIB /usr/local/share/proj

I'd appreciate any suggestions.

And, three miscellaneous comments:

	1. In the (generic) INSTALL file the instruction to use ./configure
should I think be ../configure

	2. What is the third output value from cs2cs?

	3. The Oxford English Dictionary (which I can get online) does
not have gradian. As this is probably new, redundant with existing usage, and
misleading (radians are not involved) shouldn't it be deprecated?

	Thanks for producing such a useful system--I have already used it
to solve a mystery with some Arc/Info files (which claimed to contain projected
coordinates that used WGS84 but actually used Clarke 1866)--now, if I
can just get the datum shifts to work...

Message-ID: <3D6604EA.9020204@inogs.it>

Hi to all,

  this is my first experience with cs2cs so please be patient. I'm 
trying to shift coordinates between two different datums: wgs84 and 
Roma40 using a 7 parameter transformation.

cs2cs -vErs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 \
  +to +proj=latlong +ellps=intl\
  +towgs84=-85.88,-28.85,+49.67,-1.003,-2.383,-1.808,+27.82 \
   ap

The ap file is this:

# Abbazia Pisani
45d37'01.767"N 11d51'25.843"E 77.79

My output (Linux RH 7.3) is this:

# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +ellps=intl
# +towgs84=-85.88,-28.85,+49.67,-1.003,-2.383,-1.808,+27.82
#--- following specified but NOT used
# +ellps=WGS84
# Abbazia Pisani
45d37'01.767"N 11d51'25.843"E 77.79     45d36'59.373"N  11d51'26.646"E 77.740


The 7 parameters I have are:
Tx:  85.88
Ty:  28.85
Tz: -49.67
Rx: -1.003"
Ry: -2.383"
Rz: -1.808"
K: 27.82

The shifted lat/lon pair are quite right, the point should be at 45d36'59.372"N (error 0.001") and 
-00d35'41.752" (Roma40 datum counts longitude from Monte Mario, 12d27'08.400"E =:-). Subtrating cs2cs output from Monte Mario longitude I get 0d35'41.750" (error 0.010", strange) but the real problem is height: 77.79 is the ellipsoidal height over WGS84 and the above sea level height of my point, Abbazia Pisani, is 32.71 m.

WHERE AM I WRONG?

I played a lot with the signs of the 7 parameters and this is the closest result I get. Does anybody else have problems like mine with datum shifts?

Thanks for your help and for the big job you have already done.

Dear Roberto,

It appears that you are not considering the Geoid model that is appropriate
to your datum shift.  Try going to the www.NIMA.mil web site and
downloading EGM96 (Earth Gravity Model 1996), which will give you
transformation parameters to go from WGS84 Datum ellipsoid height to "local
mean sea level."  On a good day with clear skies, and if you went to church
last Sunday, your geoid-corrected "elevation" may match local data within a
meter or so.

Such a correspondence can occur if the original 7-parameter transformation
utilized the same geoid model when solving for those parameters.

Also, be aware that a transformation can not yield coordinates that are
more accurate than the original coordinates.  Just because you have old
coordinates of Abbazia Pisani does not mean that the original survey was of
First-Order geodetic accuracy in Latitude, Longitude, and elevation.
Furthermore, how good is the geoid model for Roma 1940 Datum?  I did not
know that one existed.  If it did not exist, how did you get the ellipsoid
height of Abbazia Pisani?

With all our computerized "gizmos" and "whatchamacallits," we continue to
be (often) faced with the conundrum that "you can't get there from here !"
PROJ4 is a very nice cartographic / occasionally geodetic utility.  It's
not a geodetic panacea.

Cliff Mugnier

The 7 parameters I have are:

Tz: -49.67
Rx: -1.003"
Ry: -2.383"
Rz: -1.808"
K: 27.82

The shifted lat/lon pair are quite right, the point should be at
45d36'59.372"N (error 0.001") and
-00d35'41.752" (Roma40 datum counts longitude from Monte Mario,
12d27'08.400"E =:-). Subtrating cs2cs output from Monte Mario longitude I
get 0d35'41.750" (error 0.010", strange) but the real problem is height:
77.79 is the ellipsoidal height over WGS84 and the above sea level height
of my point, Abbazia Pisani, is 32.71 m.

WHERE AM I WRONG?

I played a lot with the signs of the 7 parameters and this is the closest
result I get. Does anybody else have problems like mine with datum shifts?

Thanks for your help and for the big job you have already done.

Dear Clifford,

  thanks for your answer but now I'm even more confused. I got the 7 
parameters from a sheet issued and SOLD by IGM (istituto Geografico 
Militare) where they tell me that Abbazia Pisani is located at
phi, lambda (geographic, datum Roma40) = Norhing, Easting (Gauss-Boaga) 
= phi, lambda (geographic, WGS84) = Norhing, Easting (UTM-WGS84).
They say also that Abbazia Pisani is located at 32.71 m above sea level 
= 77.79 ellps. height.
The 7 parameters come from the same sheet
AFAIK the 7 parameters transform should bring my point from one datum to 
another, it shouldn't know anythink about geoid.

But I made another test:

cs2cs -rs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84\
  +to +proj=latlong +ellps=intl \
  +towgs84=-85.88,-28.85,+49.67,-1.003,-2.383,-1.808,-27.82 \

  +towgs84=-85.88,-28.85,+49.67,-1.003,-2.383,-1.808,-27.82 \
  +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84

where aa contains my damned Abbazia Pisani coordinates in WGS84:

45d37'01.767"N 11d51'25.843"E 77.79

...and to my surprise the output is:

45d37'1.805"N   11d51'25.842"E -276.471

I thought the output should be pretty the same of the input or... am I 
wrong again?

Roberto,

For the inverse, you have to change the sign of the components for the
translations AND for the rotations.  The scale factor is one minus the
reciprocal.  Once you do that, then you should get sub-millimeter precision
in duplicating what you started with.

Also, note that there are two different conventions for the sense of the
rotations.  The correct way is that used by NIMA as defining the WGS84
Datum (Counter-clockwise rotations as in vector mechanics and physics).
The ITRF people in Paris confused the math and they use clockwise
rotations.  What Firenze uses depends on whether they use American GPS
software or French/Swiss software ...

So when you diddle with the parameters you were sold; you SHOULD have been
provided at least ONE test point to validate the math model you choose to
use (PROJ4), versus what the results should be.  The parameters are
intended to be used from Latitude, Longitude, ellipsoid heights to
Latitude, Longitude, ellipsoid heights.  The relation with elevation is
dependant on geoid models (at both ends of the transform).

Make sense?  I hope so; if not, continue asking questions.

The parameters I have should bring me from local datum (Roma40) that is

about geoid (AFAIK).

The geoid stuff is quite complicated and I know that many people are 
deep inside this matter. From my point of view if I run a program with 
some input and then again requiring the reverse transform I should 
return to the same starting point. So either I called the program with 
wrong parameters or it is buggy :-)

Now forget Abbazia Pisani (near Padua by the way..) and try this:

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84\
  +to \
  +proj=latlong +ellps=intl \
  +towgs84=10,20,30,1,2,3,44 \
  bb | \
cs2cs +proj=latlong +ellps=intl\
  +towgs84=-10,-20,-30,-1,-2,-3,-44 \
  +to \
  +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84


cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84\
  +to \
  +proj=latlong +ellps=intl \
  +towgs84=10,20,30,1,2,3,44 \
  bb | \
cs2cs -I +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84\
  +to \
  +proj=latlong +ellps=intl  \
  +towgs84=10,20,30,1,2,3,44

The bb file is:
11 45 77

My output is:

10d59'55.09"E   45d0'2.796"N 15.661
11dE    44d59'59.939"N 637.364

So:
1st:) The two outputs are different.
2nd:) Both are wrong.


Maybe I did not understand the syntax or my cs2cs is broken...


Any hints?

Roberto,

As Clifford suggests, PROJ.4 knows nothing about different geoid models.

You do not need to reverse the sign of the +towgs84 parameters when reversing
the direction of the transformation, so the second form you suggested (above)
is correct.  This is handled internally by PROJ.4.  The parameters should
always be expressed in a form suitable for transforming from the datum in
question to WGS84 (hence "towgs84").

That said, the parameters are clearly not being correctly inverted internally
since the elevation comes out so far from where it is supposed to be.  I will
file a bug report in bugzilla on this, but I can't promise when I will get to
fixing it. Feel free to register with bugzilla and add yourself to the cc list
so you will be notified when the bug is fixed.

   http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=194

Overall, I don't know why you can't get the correct output value, but I
imagine it is because a different mechanism is being used by IGM to express
the 7 parameters than PROJ.4 is expecting.  PROJ.4's 7 parameter datum shift
code is based on NIMA Geotrans, and apparently matches the 7 parameter parameters
as expected for method 9606 in the EPSG database.  However, there are many other
ways of expressing the transformation.  A bit more detail is available at:

   http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/gen_parms.html#towgs84

However, basically, if it doesn't work I have no idea how to transform the
parameters into a useable form.  I am sure the list would appreciate your
summarizing if you do find a solution.

Good luck,

This is not a problem. Basically having translation, rotation and scale 
means trying only 8 different parameter sets. The problem is that I 
cannot convert back again to the starting point, even using a 3 
parameter transformation.

At present I'm playing with the source code (so I must go deep inside 
the problem, deeper than I supposed and wanted to do...). I'm trying to 
understand if the problem is in the to/from WGS84 functions or in the 
geodetic/geocentric one.

Trying a wgs84 to ellps=intl with +towgs84=0,0,0 and back again restores 
latitude and longitude with a small error in height (1 cm) so I suppose 
the trick is hidden in the WGS84 functions...

Roberto:

	This is not a bug, at least not a deep one.
	
	The problem is that you have applied the scaling parameter twice;
	if you set this (the 44 in the +towgs setting) to 0 there is no
	problem (inverse of forward is the original). So, it should be set
	to -44 in the inverse to give the right answer. Since a scale
	change (mostly) inflates the Earth, the problem shows up in the
	height.
	
	I do see errors in the forward/inverse pair as the scale factor exceeds
	50 ppm, but not for 44 ppm.

A correction to my earlier posting (implicit in Prof. Mugnier's earlier
comment):

If the scale factor in the forward direction is sc, the scale factor
in the inverse should be

     1.e6*(1.0 -  1./(1+(sc/1.e6)))

which means that, for example, a scale factor of 200 (ppm) needs -199.96
for the inverse. The forward/inverse test then does well even for such
larger values of sc.

Frank,

  maybe I got the solution.

 From 
http://www.posc.org/Epicentre.2_2/DataModel/ExamplesofUsage/eu_cs35.html 
I got the formulae that I supposed you used in pj_transform.c.

I changed x_out calculation from

  x_out = M_BF*(       x[io] - Rz_BF*y[io] + Ry_BF*z[io]) + Dx_BF;

to

x_out = M_BF*(       x[io] - Rz_BF*y[io] + Rx_BF*z[io]) + Dx_BF;

in pj_geocentic_to_wgs84()

and in the same way
/*            x_out = M_BF*(       x[io] + Rz_BF*y[io] - Ry_BF*z[io]) - 
Dx_BF;
 */
            x_out = M_BF*(       x[io] + Rz_BF*y[io] - Rx_BF*z[io]) - Dx_BF;
in pj_geocentic_from_wgs84()

Now my test

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84\
 +to \
 +proj=latlong +ellps=intl \
 +towgs84=10,20,30,1,2,3,444 \
 bb | \
cs2cs -I +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84\
 +to \
 +proj=latlong +ellps=intl  \
 +towgs84=10,20,30,1,2,3,-443.80295 (thanks to Duncan Agnew)

with the bb file being:
11 45 77

gives:
11d0'0.001"E    45d0'0.001"N 77.024

Now I will go on playing with my Abbazia Pisani point, trying to add a 
longitude constant shift to output coordinates in some way as the Roma40 
datum counts longitude starting from Monte Mario :-(

Tanks to the whole community for all the help you sent so quickly. I did 
not send my solution to bugzilla because I'm not (yet!) used to it.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Converting to Finnish National Grid Coordinate System (KKJ)
In-Reply-To: <3D6B3FDA.9050104@inogs.it>
Message-ID: <Pine.SGI.4.44.0208271428010.9482-100000@beautiful.cs.hut.fi>

Hello,

I got my hands on a data cable for my Garmin GPS receiver a couple of
weeks ago and wrote a program that reads the position from the GPS device
and displays it on a GeoTIFF map. Everything I know about coordinate
transformations is what I have read from the Internet during these weeks.
Currently, my program uses

- GARNIX / LIBGEO [1] to retrieve the position and convert it to the
Finnish grid coordinate system (KKJ)

- libgeotiff / libtiff [2] to display the map and my position on the map

While trying to find another coordinate conversion library that could read
all the parameters required for the conversion from an EPSG database [3],
I run into the PROJ.4 library.


The KKJ grid coordinate system and the parameters I have used are briefly
described in this document:

http://www.nls.fi/kartta/julkaisu/kkj.html

As you can see, the coordinate system is based on ED50 coordinates, but
after doing the Transverse Mercator projection, the projected coordinates
should be transformed with 2-dimensional Helmert transformation. I think
that many programs ignore the final 2-dimensional transformation,
resulting in poor accuracy. I'm not sure if there are any parameters in
PROJ.4 that could be used to specify the 2-dimensional Helmert
transformation.


Here's what I have tried:

1) Change the EPSG database to include the ED50 datum shift:

# KKJ / Finland Uniform Coordinate System
<2393> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0.000000000 +lon_0=27.000000000 +k=1.000000
+x_0=3500000.000 +y_0=0.000 +ellps=intl
+towgs84=-93.477,-103.453,-123.431,-0.246,0.109,0.068,-2.062 +units=m
no_defs <>


2) Run cs2cs:

>cs2cs -v +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +init=epsg:2393 coordinates
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +init=epsg:2393 +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0.000000000 +lon_0=27.000000000
# +k=1.000000 +x_0=3500000.000 +y_0=0.000 +ellps=intl
# +towgs84=-93.477,-103.453,-123.431,-0.246,0.109,0. +units=m +no_defs
#--- following specified but NOT used
# +068,-2.062
3531710.65      7074338.84 -8.973


3) Do the 2D Helmert manually:

		x = 7074338.863;
		y = 3531709.713;

		y -= 3000000;

		double a = 1.0000007515;
		double b = 0.0000043933;
		double dx = -61.5805;
		double dy = 95.6691;

		x2 = (a * x) - (b * y) + dx;
		y2 = (b * x) + (a * y) + dy;

		y2 += 3000000;


This gives me exactly the correct result (I checked from the example at
http://www.nls.fi/kartta/julkaisu/kkj.html ), except that

1) For some reason PROJ.4 truncates the towgs84 parameter to 41
characters(!), and more importantly,

2) I don't want to do the 2D Helmert transformation manually.


What would you suggest?


Btw, I think it's quite amazing that cs2cs gives wrong results if I enter
latitude and longitude in wrong order even when I specify which one is
which (with N and E). It could at least display some warning message.


Thanks,

Seppo Enarvi

Probably this formula is wrong. Anyway it is diffrent from the formula I 
found in

http://www.nls.fi/kartta/julkaisu/kkj.html

and that agrees with the original version of the program. Please forget 
my preceding e-mail to this list.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Roberto
