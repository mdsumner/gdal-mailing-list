Subject: [Proj] Aruba projection
Message-ID: <4610C45A.40206@3dsite.nl>

Hello list,

I have GIS data from Aruba, an island in the dutch antilles (above 
venezuela)

In MapInfo this data shows up as "non-earth(meters)"
the bounding box is approx.:

1784, 2558 to 25233, 27400

I think it's a stereographic projection.

Is there anyone out there that nows the parameters for this local 
projection used on Aruba?

Kind regards,

Milo van der Linden

I don't think that PROJ.4 supports Transverse Mercator (South
Orientated).

Hello Milo,

I once used GIS data from Bonaire. We didn't manage to obtain any projection
information or parameters, so that we had to fall back to rubbersheeting.

Good Luck!

Milo,
 
Details and parameters of the Aruba Datum of 1951 and the Aruba Transverse Mercator Grid are in my "Grids and Datums" column of "Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing," July 2002, pp.653-654.  A pdf file of the column may be downloaded from www.ASPRS.org/resources/grids.  The other datums and grids of the Netherlands Antilles are included therein also.
 
A Stereographic projection is a good guess for a Dutch Colony, but it really is a TM - it surprised me, too.

Dear Clifford,

I am speachless, this is exactly what I need! There was absolutely no 
place on the internet where I could find this, we even contacted Aruba 
authorities, but they haven't answered up to now. I am now going to 
implement these parameters into my projection-conversion to get them to 
GoogleEarth. Once I got them all in line, I will report the resulting 
proj4 string back to the mailing list.

Again, thank you so very much and I hope Steffen can also benefit from 
your knowledge.

If at any point in time you need someone to research exotic datums and 
projections for you, I would be happy to volunteer! It seems like a 
dreamjob to travel the world for that purpose ;)

Kind regards,

Milo van der Linden

Subject: [Proj] Aruba projection
Message-ID: <461425D2.1070003@3dsite.nl>

Hello fellow geographyls!

For my Aruba projection I currently have:

    +proj=tmerc +lat_0=12.5201 +lon_0=-69.9929406 +k=0.996632 +x_0=10000 
+y_0=15000 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-266,112,-360,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs

When I use it in my conversion software, I still get a small shift upon 
the aerial-photo's in Google Earth of approx. 10m.

Any suggestions on which parameter to fine tune in order to get it right 
on the spot?

Kind regards,

Milo van der Linden

Subject: [Proj] Decimal degrees to Albers conversion
Message-ID: <REVELATIONolkDTM9wG0000006c@benchmarkrs.com>

I have a C# application that takes, as user input, decimal degrees at need
to be converted to Albers coordinates.  How would I do about doing this?  I
was hoping I could find a third party COM/.NET object to do this, but the
only one I could find was Franson and it would not convert to Albers.  Does
anyone know of the equation or object to make this conversion, or how I
would go about executing proj or cs2cs from my code?  I have been searching
for the past couple of days with no avail.

Thanks in advance,
Jim

If you're using the API, you have to convert lat/long coordinates to
radians before a transformation.  Similarly, results that return
lat/long return radians.  The API has some constants defined for this
purpose (DEG_TO_RAD, RAD_TO_DEG).  The function pj_is_latlong will tell
you if a projection definition is lat/long if you need to find out at
runtime.

My latitude is 45, longitude -117.

I am also using a C# wrapper for GDAL/OSR that uses the proj.4 library to
convert coordinates.  It is only thing I could get to work in an ASP.NET
application.

Thanks; it helps to include all that info in your problem description.  I
assumed you were using the command-line tools and making the common error

I think Eric's suggestion is very likely to be relevant.  Since this is a

Thanks for all of your help.  After looking at the method signatures I
realized that I was switching the latitude and longitude around.  Stupid
rookie mistake.  Everything seems to be converting fine now.  Thanks again.
You guys are great.

Jim -

Thanks; it helps to include all that info in your problem description.  I
assumed you were using the command-line tools and making the common error
confusing the latitude (the Y coordinate) with the X coordinate (input
should be X, Y or longitude, latitude).

I think Eric's suggestion is very likely to be relevant.  Since this is a
problem in some code you've written, could you post the code snippet that's

Hi,

I am trying to go from Irish Transverse Mercator to IrishGrid75 Ireland
using GDAL C# and EPSG codes.

The code is like this:


            double[] xyz = new double[3];

            OGR.SpatialReference inp = new OGR.SpatialReference(null);
            OGR.SpatialReference outp = new OGR.SpatialReference(null);


            int stat1 = inp.ImportFromEPSG(2157);   // Irish Transverse
Mercator
            int stat2 = outp.ImportFromEPSG(29903); // IrishGrid75 Ireland

            OGR.CoordinateTransformation tra = new
OGR.CoordinateTransformation(inp, outp);

            xyz[0] = 600000.0;
            xyz[1] = 700000.0;
            xyz[2] = 22.22;

            tra.TransformPoint(xyz);

I think the problems is with ImportFromEPSG because both istat1 and istat2
is 6 after execution. How to initialize the EPSG codes ?

I am resending this request beacuse I have not had any feedback on my
previous request.

What is the problem?
(Sorry I can't help with C-sharp stuff anyway but here's something else 
that may be important:)
Those codes should work but to be clearer about what you're doing it is 
more obvious to enter the projection in PROJ.4 syntax IMHO. In particular, 
Irish Transverse Mercator uses the WGS84 ellipsoid while Irish Grid uses 
the Modified Airy, so you will need some datum transformation parameters 
with the Irish Grid projection to get an accurate transformation. I 
suggest:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=53.5 +lon_0=-8 +k=1.000035 +x_0=200000 +y_0=250000 \
+no_defs +a=6377340.189 +rf=299.3249646 \
+towgs84=482.530,-130.596,564.557,-1.042,-0.214,-0.631,8.15 +to_meter=1

Those parameters are published by both Ordnance Surveys (ROI & NI) as 
having an accuracy of approx. 0.4m throughout Ireland.

Interesting anyway; I didn't know anybody was actually using Irish 
Transverse Mercator for anything yet!

Hei Bjørn,
 beklager sent svar, men dette har vært en meget travel dag (som vanlig...)
Sendte spørsmålet ditt videre internt i går, men ingen har benyttet C++ (?)
interfaced til gdal. Vi bruker stort sett proj.4 direkte som 
kommandolinje "proj"
eller via C biblioteket.

Om du ikke får noe svar ville jeg prøvd å sjekke ut brukermanualen for 
proj, og
se om du kan teste ut en konvertering fra kommandolinja.
Som jeg sa i går så benytter ikke proj EPSG kodene, men det skal være
mulig å finne hvilke proj parametre du må spesifisere ved å sammenligne
EPSG definisjonen med proj manualen.

Beklager at jeg ikke kan være mer konkret akkurat nå.

mvh,
Frank

I am trying to convert from ITM to IG using EPSG codes but when trying to
initialize with the EPSG codes (ITM=2157 and IG=29903) I get error code 6.

The ITM has the following definition:

<2157> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=53.5 +lon_0=-8 +k=0.999820 +x_0=600000
+y_0=750000 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs  <>

IG has the following definition:

<29903> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=53.5 +lon_0=-8 +k=1.000035 +x_0=200000
+y_0=250000 +a=6377340.189 +b=6356034.447938534 +units=m +no_defs  <>

These definitions I have found in a file with name EPSG downloaded from
the proj-4.50 project.

Bjørn,

You don't indicate what the transformed result is or why you think there
is an error.  But if ImportFromEPSG() is failing (result 6 is
OGRERR_FAILURE) then it is likely because the EPSG .csv files aren't
being found.  One way around this is to set the GDAL_DATA environment
variable to point to the directory where the files like pcs.csv and gcs.csv
live.  In the source distribution they are in the gdal\data directory.

I think you can also do something like:

   Gdal.PushFinderLocation("C:\\gdal\\data");

or

   Gdal.SetConfigOption( "GDAL_DATA", "C:\\gdal\\data" );

though my csharp-gdal-fu is weak.

Subject: [Proj] invproj call
Message-ID: <87abxdrr3q.fsf@patagonia.sebmags.homelinux.org>

Hi,

I've only recently started using proj4 tools directly.  I need to do an
inverse projection (back to lat lon geographic coordinates) from an Albers
equal area projection.  The projection details for the source are:


projection="Albers Conic"
lat_0=45
lon_0=55
lat_1=40
lat_2=50


No other information is provided, but I assume WGS84 datum.  So I wrote
the invproj call like:


invproj +proj=aea +lat_0=45 +lon_0=55 +lat_1=40 +lat_2=50 +datum=WGS84


but I'm getting some strange results, as if the data have been shifted
more than I would expect.  Is my call correct based on the given input?
Thanks in advance for any comments.


Cheers,

Seb

Frank,
I have been trying what you suggested but no luck. I added the code line
"GDAL.gdal.SetConfigOption("GDAL_DATA", "D:\\gdal-1.4.0\\data");", also
tried Gdal.PushFinderLocation with no luck before calling ImportFromEPSG.
In this directory is all files from the source distribution data
directory. There is no EPSG file in this directory. I did find one EPSG
file in the source distribution for "proj-4.5.0\nad" catalog.
I copied this file to "D:\\gdal-1.4.0\\data" but still no luck. When
stepping though code line "OGR.CoordinateTransformation tra = new
OGR.CoordinateTransformation(inp, outp);" I get an
"AccessViolationException was unhandled" error.
The expected result is Easting:200049.410 Northing: 200049.410

Frank,
The expected result is Easting:200049.410 Northing: 199965.743 (sorry,
typo error in my previous answer)
I forgot to mention that I still get returncode 6 from ImportFromEPSG.
Also adding the EPSG file for both ITM and IG.

Bjørn,

Did you try using ImportFromProj4 with more success?
You should also test with a file monitoring tool (like SysInternals
filemon) to see the expected location of the epsg file.

Best regards,

Tamas

Bjørn

Note that OGR's ImportFromEPSG() method does not read the PROJ.4 epsg
init file.  It reads the gcs.csv and pcs.csv files from the GDAL
distribution ... a more direct dump of the EPSG parameters.  Adding a
new projection to the PROJ.4 epsg file won't generally help OGR.

As Tamas suggests, I'd encourage you to directly import as a PROJ.4
string.

Subject: [Proj] GK31_Tirol (Austria)
Message-ID: <0003E83C.461FB308@dvise.alpstein.de>



Hello,

I have to deal with data from Austria which is in GK31_Tirol.
We preprocess our data with ESRI and use postgis (and so proj4)
for our web applications.

Our web application must convert GK31_Tirol to WGS84 for
GPS tracks and kml exports.

We transformed some coordinates succesfully with ESRI's ArcMap.
But proj and cs2cs give me different coordinates.
The coordinates ESRI produces match e.g. Google:
http://maps.google.de/maps?f=q&hl=de&q=47.487218+12.254853&layer=&ie=UTF8&z=16&ll=47.486948,12.254992&spn=0.009295,0.013003&om=1
(street crossing)

The point was digitized with projection GK31_Tirol
and then converted with ESRI.
(GCS Transformation using MGI_To_WGS_1984_3 which lists exactly the same
parameters as the towgs84 parameters used below.)

I'm interested in the transformation GK31_Tirol to WGS84 in postgis.
I always got a significant shift with proj4 (see below).

Thanks for your help.

cheers
Jens Schwarz

Just out of curiosity, will OSR convert a shapefile from one projection or
coordinate system to another projection or cordon system?  If not, what
other options/tools are available for me to do this?  I am writing a Web
application in C#, so something in .NET would be extra helpful, if not, I
can always invoke a commandline tool; speaking of that, which one would I
use?  I have a shapefile that is in Albers Equal Area that I need to convert
to Mercator that I can lay on top of Virtual Earth, any ideas?

Jens,

The keyword is +towgs84, not +towgs!  With this fixed I get the same
result as ESRI.

To reproject shapefiles, you could use e.g. ogr2ogr from the OGR package

http://www.gdal.org/ogr/

or shpproj from shapelib:

http://www.gdal.org/ogr/

The boundaries of the zones (Strefa) in the Polish 1965 Roussilhe 
system extensively discussed on this list in 2005-2006 are highly irregular.

Given the lat/lon (Krassovsky ellipsoid) of an arbitrary point in 
Poland between 49N - 55N and 14E and 24E, how can I determine in 
which zone the point lies so that the different false eastings and 
northings in each zone as well as the parameters for the GK piece in 
zone 5 can be used to get the Roussilhe E/N values using either 
sterea or Otto van Vlijman's version?

This is a classic "point in polygon" problem, but where can one get 
the 5 polygons (ArcGis Shape Files for the zones perhaps) with 
accuracy sufficient to use with the 1:10000 maps with minimum error 
at zone boundaries?  Alternatively, where can I find a file of 
coordinates in lat/lon or E/N for the corners of the whole collection 
of 1:10000 maps?

My knowledge of Polish unfortunately is nil, but a reference would be 
appreciated none the less.

I would love to have them too :). AFAIK no such free dataset exists.
You may ask at CODGiK [1] or GUGiK [2], if they have such data for sale
or who might; if they speak English.

At best I could find info like this on the CRS portal [3]:

latitude limits of zones

zone I:   48°55' N ... 52°20' N
zone II:  51°20' N ... 54°30' N
zone III: 52°10' N ... 54°50' N
zone IV:  48°45' N ... 53°20' N
zone V:   49°20' N ... 51°20' N

longitude limits of zones

zone I:   18°00' E ... 24°10' E
zone II:  19°00' E ... 24°00' E
zone III: 14°05' E ... 20°00' E
zone IV:  14°15' E ... 19°05' E
zone V:   18°20' E ... 19°40' E



or in the EPSG database [4]:

area_code=	1515 (Poland - zone I)
area_name=	Poland - zone I
area_of_use=	Poland - southeast - south of 52 deg 20 min North and east
of 18 deg East.

Jim,

As mentioned, you can use ogr2ogr at the commandline.

You can also implement something similar in C#.  Of key interest would be
the Transform() method on the Geometry class.  You pass in an
OSRCoordinateTransformation object and the geometry is transformed in
place.

The shapefile driver for OGR supports writing features back where they came
from so you should be able to iterate through the shapefile reading features,
doing the Transform() on their geometries, and then using SetFeature() to
write the feature and it's geometry back in the file.

All of this isn't really very PROJ.4 oriented though.  If you need followup
help the place to go would be the gdal-dev list.

Best regards,

If the zone (Strefa) boundaries were straight lines, I wouldn't have 
had to post my query in the first place. I got them from the Geodeta 
2000 Nr. 4 article and tried them first, but the ambiguities when the 
very curved borders are approached in a lat/lon sweep make them 
unusable. Also the map numbers are duplicated in each zone to some 
extent, making them useless too.  Since the people who will be using 
my free software are unlikely to be willing to pay for something 
special, it doesn't look hopeful.  A similar problem arose with the 
older Japanese GK Bessel based grid system where things change along 
prefecture boundaries, but at least with that system, lat/lons and 
grid coordinates are unambiguous.

hi jens,

you are writing of "GK31_Tirol" which means Gauss-Krüger M(eridian)31. 

but be aware where your data is in Tirol:

   North-Tirol is in GK28 (Meridian 28)
   East-Tirol is in GK31 (Meridian 31)

you can have a look at my homepage, where i prepared the parameter (inclusive towgs-parameter) for the 3 meridians in austria in wkt-format.

Subject: [Proj] Projection file --> proj string
Message-ID: <005b01c77ee3$96fd5810$6501a8c0@jim>

I'm trying to convert a shapefile using ogr2ogr that is in Albers, and comes
with the following projection file contents.

Projection    ALBERS

Zunits        NO

Units         METERS

Spheroid      CLARKE1866

Xshift        0.0000000000

Yshift        0.0000000000

Parameters

 46  0  0.000 /* 1st standard parallel

 48  0  0.000 /* 2nd standard parallel

-109 30  0.000 /* central meridian

 44 15  0.000 /* latitude of projection's origin

600000.00000 /* false easting (meters)                                  
0.00000 /* false northing (meters)                                      

I am new at the whole proj thing, but I figured out how the utility works
with proj strings, but when I convert this to WGS84 it puts the geometries
in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico.  

For the source SRS I am using:
+proj=aea +lat_1=29.5 +lat_2=45.5 +lat_0=23 +lon_0=-96 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0.0
+ellps=GRS80 +units=m +datum=NAD83 +no_defs

For my destination SRS I am using:
+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +no_defs

How would I convert my source SRS string to use the information from the
projection file?  Or, is their way that I can just pass in the projection
file name or something?

Thanks in advance,
Jim

Hello,
Is there anyone who can tell me more about the geodetic 
datum KS 42, which may or may not be the same thing 
as KS 42/83.  

It seems to be used in Germany.  

The only hard facts I have found on the web 
is a 3-parameter transform at 
http://www.semtech.com/pc/downloadDocument.do?navId=H0,C1,C193,P2675&id=
843
which says

region         datum  Reference  ID   dX       dY         dZ
Germany (FRG)  KS42   KS         16  22.8615  -114.7262  -95.8874

but I cannot use this without knowing the ellipsoid 
size and shape.  And I would also like to know the 
accuracy of the transform, and a more official source 
for the datum. 

Best regards,
   Mikael Rittri, Carmenta AB, Sweden

a good site for such information is http://crs.bkg.bund.de/crs-eu
It takes getting used to, but there are many informations
concerning europe crs's.

For your special case, select "CRS Description" in the menu
on the right and then "national CRS". Select "Germany" in the
list or on the map. The next page contains "DE_42/83/GK_3"
as CRS, which seems to be the one you've searched for.

Hope that helps,
Uwe

cs2cs works now. I didn't see that the parameter is called towgs84 for proj and towgs for cs2cs.

I need it in postgis. I don't know if it would be enough to set the cs2cs parameter string as proj4text there.
I'll ask their mailing list.

As we're running web applications, we're also using the javascript port of proj.
The cs2cs port isn't there yet.

hi helmut,

thanks for you help.
the homepage gave me useful information.

I still have some todo's to succeed with gk31 (see my other mail).
Don't know if it would have been better to use utm or another gk.
But source data is gk31. Seemed to be the easiest way.

Jens,

It is towgs84 everywhere.  Is there some documentation in conflict with this?
If so, let me know and I'll fix it.

You should be able to use the same coordinate system in proj4text
as you used on the cs2cs commandline.

Ah, well the javascript library is a completely different implementation so
you do have to be wary about compatability issues.

Message-ID: <6fb81fc70704201232j46a4e7a0s7f26a7f60434ec91@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I've been using proj.4 for a few months, and I'm pretty happy with it
but today, I tried to create a port for the OpenBSD OS, hence I tried
to run 'gmake check' which fails.

I've then tried 'make check' on my linux box, but it fails as well.

The failure always happens on './testntv2'.

Google didn't help, any hints ?

Cheers.

The 'testvarious' test is failing too.

Is it a bug and should I report it to the Bugzilla engine or is it
rather inaccuracies ?

Benoit,

The testntv2 failure is expected because you likely don't have the NTv2
file.  I'm not sure why testvarious is failing though it seems to do so
for me too.  Feel free to file a bug on that.

Best regards,

I've been looking for this "NTv2" file on the repo [1] but couldn't
find it ? Any hints ? Note that we add the content of
"proj-datumgrid-1.3.tar.gz" to the nad directory before configuring
and compiling.

Ok. What relevant information should I add with the bug-report ?

Benoit,

It isn't distributed with PROJ.4 nor does it live in the repository.
I think there is some license restriction about redistribution or
perhaps it was just to big for me to host in CVS, I can't recall.
You need to contact someone in the Canadian government to get it.
This might be covered in the FAQ or perhaps the mailing list archive.

The error report, operating system, and PROJ version it occured with
should be sufficient.  Since I can already reproduce it I don't need
a huge amount of supporting info.

Frank,

Importing as a PROJ.4 string is working fine. Thank you !
Where can I find documentation on syntax for proj4 string. eg:
+units= xx, what are the available units?

proj ignores towgs84 (as far as I can reproduce it):

proj +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel +lat_0=0 +lon_0=13.333333 +k=1.000000 +x_0=0 +y_0=-5000000 +towgs84=577.326,90.129,463.919,5.1366,1.4742,5.2970,2.4232 -r<<EOF

proj +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel +lat_0=0 +lon_0=13.333333 +k=1.000000 +x_0=0 +y_0=-5000000 -r<<EOF
> 47.487218 12.254853

-81265.97       261441.61

But:

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel +lat_0=0 +lon_0=13.333333 +k=1.000000 +x_0=0 +y_0=-5000000 +towgs84=577.326,90.129,463.919,5.1366,1.4742,5.2970,2.4232 -r<<EOF

-81220.59       261502.07 -47.76

I couldn't get the right result with proj, only with cs2cs (and your help).
I wondered if/how postgis decides when to use proj or cs2cs.

I tried to do it brute force and did the following in postgis:

select * from spatial_ref_sys where srid=31255;

 srid  | auth_name | auth_srid | srtext |           proj4text

                                          +x_0=0 +y_0=-5000000
                                          +towgs84=577.326,90.129,463.919,5.1366,1.4742,5.2970,2.4232


select AsText(Transform(PointFromText('POINT(47.487218 12.254853)',4326),31255));

                  astext
-------------------------------------------
 POINT(3933583.45695887 -3371941.86007218)

I'm confused as it's not right and not the same as proj on command line.

Bjorn,

To list units run "proj -lu" in the comand line.
Other list options area -le for ellipsoids and -lp for projections.
You can find proj dodumentation in http://proj.maptools.org/

Hi there.

I have some co-ordinates in NZMG (X,Y Co-ordinates) and I wish to convert 
them into Lat Long so I can map them on maps.google.com.

Can someone give me any help or examples on how to do this?

Thanks
Craig

Hi Craig

You can use the LINZ site to convert between NZMG and WGS84.

The link is:

http://www.linz.govt.nz/apps/coordinateconversions/index.html?Advanced=0

Depends how many you need to do?

Quite a few more than 5 .. is there a cs2cs command line I can use instead 
or alike?

Thanks

Hi Craig

Of course there is, try the following:

cs2cs +proj=nzmg +datum=nzgd49 +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 -f "%.6f"

This will put you into manual input mode. If you have them all in a
file with coordinate pairs on separate lines then just redirect the
file in like so:

cs2cs +proj=nzmg +datum=nzgd49 +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 -f
"%.6f"  < nzmgcoords.txt > wgs84coords.txt

The above will give you the lat longs in decimal degrees with 6
decimal places, if you require degrees minutes and seconds just remove
the -f part at the end.

The above command works for me on linux should work on windows
(shudder) but not sure.

FWIW, from a GRASS-GIS NZMG location using the 7-parm transform (same as
"proj -ld" shows) I get the following for the cs2cs "from" part:

GRASS 6.3> g.proj -jf
+proj=nzmg +x_0=2510000.0000000000 +y_0=6023150.0000000000 +a=6378388 +rf=297 +no_defs +towgs84=59.47,-5.04,187.44,0.47,-0.1,1.024,-4.5993 +to_meter=1.0

Which is well tested & known to work well with about 4m accuracy (fine for
use with Google maps).

using +datum=nzgd49 should give this part:  ("proj -ld")
   +towgs84=59.47,-5.04,187.44,0.47,-0.1,1.024,-4.5993

but perhaps not the needed false eastings and northings?? (+x_0 and +y_0)
same for +a and +rf??

It is simpler to just use the EPSG code, +init=epsg:27200

# NZGD49 / New Zealand Map Grid
<27200> +proj=nzmg +lat_0=-41 +lon_0=173 +x_0=2510000 +y_0=6023150 +ellps=intl +datum=nzgd49 +units=m +no_defs  <>


do use the LINZ online conveter to convert some test points & test your
cs2cs string before trusting the bulk conversion.



If you want 10-30cm accuracy you will need to use the LINZ NTv2 distortion
grid instead of the 3 or 7 +towgs84 params, as follows:

+proj=nzmg +x_0=2510000.0000000000 +y_0=6023150.0000000000 +a=6378388 +rf=297 +no_defs +nadgrids=/usr/share/proj/nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb +to_meter=1.0

(change /usr/share/proj/ to where you keep the grid file; download
from ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/ or LINZ's website)

it should do.

+a and +rf are supplied by +ellps=intl of course,

$ proj -le | grep intl
     intl a=6378388.0      rf=297.          International 1909 (Hayford)

Google Maps is not lat/long WGS84 AFAIK. It is a Mercator, details [1]
(was alredy mentioned on PROJ list).

Yes, it's a command-line tool called pgsql2shp and it's part of the standard
