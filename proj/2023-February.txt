Hi

due to problems in https://proj.org, I went to read documenation at
https://osgeo-proj.readthedocs.io/ ... and the surprise was that it
redirected to https://pointcloud.org/ Is that intentional (it looks like)
and temporary?

Another topic: in the applications, for instance
https://pointcloud.org/en/9.1/apps/projinfo.html , the parameters with two
dashes (like ?spatial-test) appears with a single long dash, instead of two
dashes. Later below it appears correctly with two: --spatial-test
I was confused (my memory is not great). I assume that the formatting is
done automatically, but it would be clearer with the actual symbol in case
anybody copy-pastes it.

Cheers.
Javier

Yes, Howard is currently experimenting with RTD & DNS with a domain he 
has full control on to know what to ask exactly to OSGeo's DNS provider, 
so that ultimately proj.org can be aliased to the RTD version.

I see this is the same with the proj.org version, so not a RTD specific 
thing. Will be fixed per https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/3604

Sorry for the mix up. I was testing a RTD deployment using pointcloud.org <http://pointcloud.org/> as the domain this morning. It is an OSGeo-hosted domain that isn't really being used for anything else. This was in preparation for a motion to migrate proj.org <http://proj.org/> to do the same when the PSC makes the motion and votes, etc.

Search is not working in proj.org (https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/issues/3549).
It does work in readthedocs, so Kristian suggested just to wait for the
migration.

No problem about that, just wanted to confirm that it was under the radar.
Thanks Howard for doing that work. Testing with that domain is a good idea.

Thanks Even. Very quick fix!

I was going to see how the new option `smartquotes = False` changes the
format, and I realized that
there are no build tasks on the PR. Is that because of the "Doc:" in the
commit message?
(One motivation (not the only one) to move to readthedocs was to see the
documentation of the PRs?)

Cheers.

Thee are build tasks. You probably just to click the "Show all tasks" 
link to see them. As it touches only the doc/ subdirectory, only the 
jobs related to doc building are triggered.

Subject: [PROJ] Motion: Migrate proj.org to ReadTheDocs
Message-ID: <16A9CDD0-F6FD-46EB-A9F2-189FE3F9CC77@hobu.co>

All,

I would like to motion to migrate proj.org <http://proj.org/> from our self-managed GitHub Pages-based deployment to one based on ReadTheDocs (RTD). The new deployment will host multi-versioned content all the way back to 5.0 thanks to Mike Taves. 

As I mentioned in a previous email, the RTD deployment is temporarily pointed at https://pointcloud.org <https://pointcloud.org/> to simulate a domain deployment on OSGeo's DNS infrastructure. When the motion passes, we will simply move the pointer to proj.org <http://proj.org/> The deployment currently has RTD's ad network enabled, but this will be removed once the sponsorship purchase process completes its move through OSGeo. The migration to RTD brings us some useful benefits such as documentation rendering in PRs, convenient multi-versioned doc hosting, and a reduction of our volunteer time consumed by documentation system management. 

PROJ's docs are comprehensive, thorough, and beautiful, and they rival the Snyder book for projection math, examples, and graphics. Thank you to all of the contributors who have helped bring PROJ's docs forward to a much better place [1].

It sounds totally reasonable, the benefits seem cool, and the demo looks
great.
However, I'd like to know a bit more about what is involved with using RTD
for proj.org.

A few years ago, I had a less than great experience with RTD due to
instability and lack of ability to be able to fix underlying issues with a
highly constrained environment. I have found not using it to be a painless
experience. However, it seems like they have been actively developing it
and it does have some nice features. So, it is likely worth trying out.

First of all, good job on this Howard and Mike. Thanks for taking the lead and following through with both the admin and grunt work!

I too am +0 for this but it can easily be turned into a +1:

RTD is great and the doc versioning is a killer feature. In light of Alan?s previous experiencing I?d like to have a basic contingency plan in case RTD turns out to not be great fit for the project in the long run. Returning back to GitHub Pages is the obvious solution to that problem. How big a pain is it to redirect proj.org <http://proj.org/> away from RTD again if things turn south?

Alan,

I think the situation has improved significantly as far as customization of the build environment on RTD in the past couple of years. PROJ has a complex documentation build setup ? we build the library, run doxygen over it to generate breathe content, and we have a very large pdflatex output. All of these components are handled by current RTD, which supports running your own Python environments along with providing the ability to modify the ubuntu- and conda- based documentation building environment. It wasn't painless for us either, but after some iteration, Mike and I got it to a workable solution. You can follow our journey getting it going for PROJ in the ticket https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/3538

Kristian,

We could go back to what we have now ? a self-hosted GitHub Pages setup ? by reenabling it and moving the DNS pointer. The downside of that it is more work to maintain going forward, updating it for anything but simple things must be done by people in the know, and multi-version docs would need to be hand-rolled. 

As far as I'm concerned, our proposed RTD implementation is better than our hand-crafted setup in all dimensions at this point. The biggest risk is the viability of RTD going forward, but that is a shared risk in the same way GitHub was before Microsoft bought it. Even so, if it went away, we could roll our own infrastructure as we have been doing.

I'm not PSC so I know I don't get to vote, but:

I am unclear on if this means we are relying on non-Free software, vs
something osgeo could host entirely with Free software and is just going
to pay for service.  If it involves non-Free software I am -1.

I am -1 on any ads appearing, even for a brief time, on anything pointed
to officially (vs a staging/proof-of-concept server).  Ads are one
thing, but presumably these are targeted ads that are privacy invasive.
I am guessing this is in the US and hence no rules but it strikes me as
bad practice for osgeo to operate/condone anything that isn't also GDPR
compliant.  Same thing for google analytics (or anything that leads to
data being captured by a company that engages in invasive advertising).

The service infrastructure of RTD is not completely open source, but quite a bit of it is. Most of its CPU and network is donated. See https://readthedocs.org/sustainability/ for details.

I think people might not realize how much positive impact RTD has had on open source documentation infrastructure. PROJ was using an adaptation of the RTD theme when I first released the Sphinx-based docs. A very large number of open source projects leverage it to provide document generation and hosting. There's a safety-in-numbers aspect to RTD as well as the fact that it works very well in comparison to running your own thing. That consumes contributor effort and doesn't benefit from a larger audience having shared experience with RTD as opposed to individual custom setups like we have with PROJ. I totally get that this is the same argument for GitHub, and people have just as big a problem with that too...

As far as ads go, does your ad blocker not work for some reason? :) We can wait to move the DNS until OSGeo completes the purchase to allow us to shut off the ads.

Also not a PSC member but it is Open Source, see https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/open-source-philosophy.html

And OSGeo, via the PROJ project will be subscribing to a Gold Membership so there won't be ads. We are just awaiting OSGeo 2023 Budget approval before starting the Gold Membership.

My ad blocker works fine, and I even use uMatrix.

To me not contributing to or endorsing the privacy-invading ad world is
an ethical matter, and I've seen lots of people without adequate
blockers.  I admit that I'm somewhat of an outlier.

Waiting until payment seems like a good move.

It seems RTD has improved quite a bit over the last few years as far as the
control over the environment and there is a path to revert back to GitHub
pages if necessary. It is used by many projects in the open source
community, so if something goes wrong, there will be a solid community base
experiencing the same issues. Hopefully that leads to quick resolutions if
any issues arise.

Just to add a technical note for RTS, I tried implementing RTD for
PROJ a few years ago, but ran into a blocker. There was no
hooks/ability to modify the artefacts after they were built, which is
required to publish JSON schema in a custom path. This is now overcome
with pre/post build jobs [1] available since April 2022.

Interacting with RTD for the past month has been mostly positive.
There is plenty of development flexibility, e.g. finding specific
versions of Doxygen from conda-forge. I've encountered a few random
build failures, but nothing too bad (these happen on other CI
infrastructure too).

Having read their documentation I withdraw my comments about ads.   They
are apparently the 1 in 10000 that does not have ads based on tracking
and I'm glad to see it.

I do think google analytics should be turned off.

Subject: [PROJ] Wrong geoidgrids no longer causing error
Message-ID: <CAC7nBy7PeTotxeW7kSVkTS=-Q+P8zzm2TNvT7X2z40ntPntW3A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

could you pls help deciding if this is a bug or feature?

I want to move a piece of code from Python 3.10 to 3.11 and updating the
pyproj version made a unit test that tests for a failure not to work
anymore, as what was a failure before no longer seems to be it.

The code - note that geoidgrids egm96_25.gtx is intentionally wrong and
doesn't exist:

from pyproj import Transformer,CRS

crs_current = CRS.from_proj4('+proj=tmerc +lat_0=51 +lon_0=0 +k=1 +x_0=0
+y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +geoidgrids=egm96_25.gtx +vunits=m +no_defs')
crs_4326 = CRS.from_epsg(4326)
transformer = Transformer.from_crs(crs_current, crs_4326, always_xy=True)

When running this piece of code in Python 3.10 + pyproj 3.3.1 (=proj 8.2.0)
results in an exception:

>>> transformer = Transformer.from_crs(crs_current, crs_4326,
always_xy=True)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File
"/home/istvan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyproj/transformer.py",
line 573, in from_crs
    return Transformer(
  File
"/home/istvan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyproj/transformer.py",
line 310, in __init__
    self._local.transformer = transformer_maker()
  File
"/home/istvan/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/pyproj/transformer.py",
line 97, in __call__
    return _Transformer.from_crs(
  File "pyproj/_transformer.pyx", line 1003, in
pyproj._transformer._Transformer.from_crs
  File "pyproj/_transformer.pyx", line 1073, in
pyproj._transformer._Transformer._init_from_crs
  File "pyproj/_transformer.pyx", line 809, in
pyproj._transformer._Transformer._initialize_from_projobj
pyproj.exceptions.ProjError: Input is not a transformation.: (Internal Proj
Error: pipeline: Pipeline: Bad step definition: proj=vgridshift (File not
found or invalid))

Which is IMHO the right behaviour, as the given geoidgrids is wrong.

But when running with Python 3.11 and pyproj 3.4.1 (=proj 9.1.0) this
doesn't cause any exception and the returned transformer is happily
transforming coordinates.

Is this a bug or a feature? Shall I create a new issue in the tracker to
"restore" the old behavior - to make a wrong input result in an error?

Thanks,
Istvan

Message-ID: <AM0P192MB04829A295976F90C3538C720EFA49@AM0P192MB0482.EURP192.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM>

Dear list members,

I work at Dutch NMA responsible for the Dutch national CRS named RDNAP. We recommend the use of PROJ for coordinate transformations, as it uses our official transformation to ETRS89 from EPSG.

  *   Horizontal: https://epsg.org/transformation_9282/Amersfoort-to-ETRS89-9.html (and https://epsg.org/transformation_9281/Amersfoort-to-ETRS89-8.html)
  *   Vertical: https://epsg.org/transformation_9597/ETRS89-to-ETRS89-NAP-height-2.html (and https://epsg.org/transformation_9283/ETRS89-to-NAP-height-2.html)

However, I noticed that at the moment PROJ doesn't by default use the transformation we recommend for transformation to ITRF2014.

RDNAP to ETRF2000:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:7931 -d 9
The result is in accordance with our official transformation:
52.000000000 5.000000000 43.0000 2023.00

RDNAP to WGS84:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:4326 -d 9
The result is a null transformation in accordance with our recommendation:
52.000000000 5.000000000 43.0000 2023.00

RDNAP via ETRF2000 to ITRF2014:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:7931 -d 9 | cs2cs epsg:7931 epsg:7912 -d 9
The result is a time-dependant transformation in accordance with our recommendation:
52.000005512 5.000008256 43.0197 2023.00

RDNAP to ITRF2014:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:7912 -d 9
The result is a null transformation, which is not what we recommend:
52.000000000 5.000000000 43.0000 2023.00

I assume that the best way to fix this is to ask EPSG to link RDNAP to ETRF2000 instead of the ETRS89 datum ensemble. Would that indeed solve the problem in PROJ?

Kind regards, Jochem

To answer my own question (so next time I run into it I can find my answer
:) ) - this specific transform doesn't rely on the geoidgrids parameter, as
it is an xy transform only, and geoidgrids is for z. So quite probably what
happens here is that the older version just tried to load the nonexistant
file but didn't actually used it afterwards, and the new one doesn't even
try to load it as it can decide it is unnecessary.

You didn't mention which PROJ version you use. But starting with 9.1.0, 
here's the result I get:

$ echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | PROJ_NETWORK=ON

[...]
52.000004918??? 5.000008844 43.001783708 2023.00

This is the first pipeline suggested by projinfo -s epsg:7415 -t epsg:7912:

unknown id, Inverse of RD New + Amersfoort to ETRS89 (9) + Inverse of 
ETRS89 to NAP height (2) + Null geographic offset from ETRS89 (geog3D) 
to ETRS89 (geog2D) + ETRS89 to ETRF2014 + Conversion from ETRF2014 
(geog2D) to ETRF2014 (geocentric) + Inverse of ITRF2014 to ETRF2014 (2) 
+ Conversion from ITRF2014 (geocentric) to ITRF2014 (geog3D), 0.102 m, 
Netherlands - onshore, including Waddenzee, Dutch Wadden Islands and 
12-mile offshore coastal zone., at least one grid missing

PROJ string:

 ? +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg

So this kind of works, but using the ETRS89 -> ETRF2014 direct 
transformation, not through the ETRF2000 -> ETRF2014 one you expect, 
which is quite logical since NAP height is only linked to ETRS89.

I wouldn't say "instead", but "in addition". There should likely be a 
ETRF2014 to NAP height transformation, and a Amersfoort to ETRF2014 one 
(that could be a concatenation of Amersfoort to ETRS89 (9) + ETRS89 -> 
ETRF2000 + ETRF2000 -> ETRF2014? or Amersfoort to ETRS89 (9) + ETRS89 -> 
ETRF2014 depending on your preference)

Dear Even,

Sorry, I was using PROJ 8.2.1 as I didn?t expect the PROJ behaviour had changed since that version (see updated command results below).

We use the ETRF2000 realisation like most other NMAs, as this is recommended by EUREF for georeferencing, not ETRF2014! Therefore, ETRS89 should not be transformed to ETRF2014 with a null transformation. The correct transformation routes are:

  *   RD -> Amersfoort -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2000 -> ITRF2014
  *   NAP -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2000 -> ITRF2014

I expected this could be achieved by changing the Amersfoort-ETRS89 transformation to Amersfoort-ETRF2000 ?instead? in EPSG. I don?t understand what advantage a transformation to the ETRS89 datum ensemble ?in addition? to a transformation to the specific ETRF2000 realisation in EPSG would give.

In PROJ 9.1.1. RDNAP to ITRF2014:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:7912 -d 9
Gives:
52.000004918 5.000008844 43.0018 2023.00
This should be:
52.000005512 5.000008256 43.0197 2023.00
Like RDNAP via ETRF2000 to ITRF2014:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:7931 -d 9 | cs2cs epsg:7931 epsg:7912 -d 9

In PROJ 9.1.1. RDNAP to WGS84:
echo 128410.0957 445806.4960 -0.4754 2023.00 | cs2cs epsg:7415 epsg:4326 -d 9
Gives:
51.999999889 5.000000153 -0.4754 2023.00
This should be:
52.000000000 5.000000000 43.0000 2023.00
Like RDNAP via ETRF2000 to WGS84:

The null transformation between ETRS89 and ETRF2014 comes with the 
definition of the datum ensemble ETRS89 (cf change

Changing from ETRS89 to ETRF2000 could (potentially) negatively impact 
workflows RDNAP to ETRS89 that behave properly currently. Anyway you can 
simulate that by hacking your proj.db and modifying the existing records 
or adding ones to see the effect of your changes

If you only specify EPSG:4326, the vertical transformation is not used, 
so you get the following pipeline:

unknown id, Inverse of RD New + Amersfoort to WGS 84 (4), 1 m, 
Netherlands - onshore, including Waddenzee, Dutch Wadden Islands and 
12-mile offshore coastal zone.

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline
 ? +step +inv +proj=sterea +lat_0=52.1561605555556 +lon_0=5.38763888888889
 ??????? +k=0.9999079 +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel

To get a 3D transformation, you need to specify EPSG:4979 as target:

unknown id, Inverse of RD New + Amersfoort to ETRS89 (9) + Inverse of 
ETRS89 to NAP height (2) + ETRS89 to WGS 84 (1), 1.002 m, Netherlands - 
onshore, including Waddenzee, Dutch Wadden Islands and 12-mile offshore 
coastal zone., at least one grid missing

Message-ID: <DCAB46FA-17DC-4C78-A25F-08130EA2D1EC@gmail.com>

All,

We are closing in on March 1st which is the release date of both PROJ 9.2.0 and PROJ-data 1.13.
In preparation for the final releases I have uploaded release candidates for both packages.

Download the archives here:

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-9.2.0RC1.tar.gz
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-9.2.0RC1.zip 

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-data-1.13RC1.tar.gz
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-data-1.13RC1.zip

The PROJ release includes a number of improvements, new features and bug fixes. See the release notes below.

The PROJ-data release adds the following transformations grids:

- American NADCON5 grids
- An updated version of no_kv_arcgp-2006-sk.tif
- Slovenian geoid model SLO-VRP2016/Koper

Please test the release candidates and report any issues you may find with them. Either here
on the mailing list or on GitHub.

     fail instead of opting for the next best transformation.

     With ONLY_BEST=YES a transformation will fail if a needed grid is unavailable.

     The option can be toggled in proj.ini and with --only-best in cs2cs.

     of an official one (#3624)

 + Well-Known Text improvements

   o Support WKT:2019 COORDINATEMETADATA[] construct (#2711)

   o implement alterCSLinearUnit for CompoundCRS (#3325)

   o Implement alterCSLinearUnit for BoundCRS (#3327)

   o Added PJ_TYPE_DERIVED_PROJECTED_CRS (#3488)

   o Added support for ISO19111 CoordinateMetadata class (#3562)

   o WKT1 parser: Support inf as inverse flattening value (#3626)

 + PROJJSON

   o Version number changed to 0.6

   o Added an additional optional source_crs property in abridged_transformation (#3454)

   o Added support for ISO19111 CoordinateMetadata class (#3562)

 + C/C++ API

   o C API: add proj_get_domain_count(), proj_get_area_of_use_ex() and proj_get_scope_ex() (#3588)

   DEPRECATIONS

   The following functions have been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

   o C API function proj_rtodms. Use proj_rtodms2 instead (#3431)

   o C experimental API function proj_create_conversion_tunisia_mapping_grid().
     Use proj_create_conversion_tunisia_mining_grid() instead (#3559)

  o Implemented stricter matching by name to avoid false positives (#3487)

  o Improved numerical accuracy of the meridian length calculations and its inverse (#3516)

  o Added PROJ_IGNORE_CELESTIAL_BODY=YES environment variable that allows better matching of
    non-earth shaped ellipsoids to other celestial bodies (#3569)

 Bug fixes
 ----------

 o rtodms(): fix potential buffer overflow not dealt with (#3441)

 o NetworkFile::open(): fix memory leak in unlikely error code path (#3443)

 o When importing LOCAL_CS["foo"], generates a non-empty name for the datum (#3491)

These two archive are empty.

Note the extremely small size compared to earlier releases:

Hi,

FYI, sqlite 3.41.0 has just been released yesterday, and I've noticed it 
causes a major performance regression with PROJ which I've reported to 
https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/bcc4375032

Hopefully there will be a fix on SQLite side in a bugfix release. 
Otherwise we might have to workaround the issue on PROJ side.

That?s unfortunate. Let?s wait and see how the SQLite team reacts. They?ll probably have it fixed 3.41.1 in which
case I don?t think we need to give it any special treatment.

I will check that. This kind of risk is exactly the reason I asked the question here, before I send a request to EPSG. Thanks!

The problem is not the null transformation between the ensemble and its members, but that the transformation route through ETRF2014 is recommended. In my opinion, the route trough ETRF2000 should be the default. Not only for the Netherlands but, for Europe in general.
Thus ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2000 -> ITRF2014 instead of ETRS89 -> ETRF2014 -> ITRF2014. What makes PROJ choose the latter?

PROJ can only infer pipelines with at most one intermediate CRS. If you 
want ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2000 -> ITRF2014, you need an explicit 
concatenated operation chaining the 3 individual steps.

In fact, in PROJ the ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2000 -> ITRF2014 route gives identical results to ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2014, and this also has only one intermediate CRS:



projinfo -s epsg:7931 -t epsg:7912

Operation No. 1:

unknown id, Conversion from ETRF2000 (geog3D) to ETRF2000 (geocentric) + Inverse of ITRF2014 to ETRF2000 (1) + Conversion from ITRF2014 (geocentric) to ITRF2014 (geog3D), 0 m



projinfo -s epsg:8403 -t epsg:7912

Operation No. 1:

unknown id, Conversion from ETRF2014 (geog3D) to ETRF2014 (geocentric) + Inverse of ITRF2014 to ETRF2014 (2) + Conversion from ITRF2014 (geocentric) to ITRF2014 (geog3D), 0 m



If it is not the number of steps, what makes PROJ not choose ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 -> ITRF2014 but  ETRS89 -> ETRF2014 -> ITRF2014 instead? And what would need to be changed in the database to change that transformation route?

It appears that the authority in charge of ETRF and ITRF made sure that 
additivity works.

That will make you smile (or not), but I believe it is lexicographic 
order.? ETRF2000->ITRF2014 and ETRF2014->ITRF2014 have both the same 
extent and advertized accuracy (0 m!), so when combined with the 
preliminary ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 or ETRS89 -> ETRF2014 null transformation 
steps which are deduced from the definition of the ETRS89 assemble using 
its 0.1 m accuracy, the resulting pipelines ETRS89 -> ETRF2000 -> 
ITRF2014 and ETRS89 -> ETRF2014 -> ITRF2014 have both the same extent 
and advertized accuracy (0.1m) (if you look at projinfo -s ETRS89 -t 
ITRF2014? --3d output, you'll see that the one using ETRF2000->ITRF2014 
is the 3rd one). So PROJ, when having to sort results, chooses the 
pipeline whose name is the greater given lexicographic order, and 
ETRF2014 > ETRF2000 according to that criterion. The preference for the 
higher lexicographic order has been chose because typically EPSG adds 
new transformations FOO (X) and FOO (Y) with increasing numbers, and all 
other things being equal, it can makes sense to use the more recent 
records. Obviously that's not always what you want, but that's slightly 
better than a dice roll, at least that's deterministic, which is what 
you need for a sort algorithm.

So what would be needed here for what you want would be to register a 
ETRS89 to ITRF2014 transformation, typically by copying the ETRF2000 -> 
ITRF2014 Helmert transformation and assigning it an accuracy slightly 
less than 0.1 m (I guess exactly 0.1 m would also work, because PROJ 
will normally favor pipelines that have less steps than other ones, all 
other things being equal, but that should be tested, especially in 
complex pipelines mixing horizontal & vertical transformations)

The Windows builds are failing because it is missing
PJ_TYPE_DERIVED_PROJECTED_CRS. Linux builds seem to work fine.

Ignore the last part about the Windows builds. All should be good to go.

All,

A few issues were reported in 9.2.0RC1. They?ve been fixed and I?ve prepared a second release candidate.

Download it here:

https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-9.2.0RC2.tar.gz <https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-9.2.0RC2.tar.gz>
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-9.2.0RC2.zip <https://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-9.2.0RC2.zip>

Hopefully no further problems are found but don?t hesitate to report them if you find any issues. As usual
they can be reported here on the mailing list or at the issue tracker on GitHub.

/Kristian

PSC Members,

No problems have been reported with 9.2.0RC2 so I motion that it be
promoted to the final release.

I'll start with my +1.
