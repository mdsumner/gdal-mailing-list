Subject: [PROJ] ESRI:102655 - z-axis in meter insted of us-ft
Message-ID: <ca71e91b-d74d-1a8c-8c9a-0c21724c9ea0@yellowscan-lidar.com>

Hi there!

I am using proj c++ api and I have the follwoing question:

When using ESRI:102655, it look like it do not convert the vertical axis 
to us-ft. My program output the |z| in meters.

If I generate the proj4 string via |proj_as_proj_string|, I retrieve the 
following string :

+proj=lcc +lat_0=36.6666666666667 +lon_0=-105.5 +lat_1=37.2333333333333 
+lat_2=38.4333333333333 +x_0=914401.828899998 +y_0=304800.6096 
+datum=NAD83 +units=us-ft +no_defs +type=crs

Then, if I add |vunits=us-ft |to the projString, I get the expected 
result (z in us-ft!)

Is that a bug or am I doing something wrong ?

Best,

Kilian

Well, this is even worse than that. You should consider that whatever value you get as the z is 
undefined. ESRI:102655 is a projected 2D CRS, so there is no Z axis. PROJ transformation 
code might do things on the z value (or not), but you shouldn't rely on that

If you want a reliable behaviour regarding the Z axis, you need to build a CompoundCRS if the 
Z value is an elevation related to a VerticalCRS, or a Projected 3D CRS if it relates to an 
ellipsoidal height.

Caution: ingesting such a string with +vunits=us-ft will be understood as a CompoundCRS 
with a VerticalCRS with a unknown datum (hint: look at the output of projinfo on such a 
string). Any transformations done with that will never apply any geoid model or other 
transformation of the Z value, except basic unit conversions. So you might be off several tens 
of meters.

Hi,

btw, I'd like to inform you that this transformation is also recognisa as

We can change the current info, but the above suggested text doesn't make sense to me. You 
have to choose between public domain or CC BY. This can't be both ("public domain" has a 
precise meaning in copyright law. The closest to public domain in the Creative commons field 
is CC0:
https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). And if it is CC BY, who is the copyright

The grid is already registered for that transformation in the PROJ database:

Message-ID: <VI1PR05MB702389AD14DD2AD2D02032A9979A0@VI1PR05MB7023.eurprd05.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

In many places we still need to support the old KKJ (EPSG:2393) system. The National Land Survey of Finland (Maanmittauslaitos) provides a TIN network and affine transformation for each triangle for converting between ETRS-TM35FIN and KKJ. This is the preferred and most accurate way to convert to and from KKJ. More information and the plain text data files can be found from NLS website though only in Finnish but you should be able to get the idea https://www.maanmittauslaitos.fi/kartat-ja-paikkatieto/asiantuntevalle-kayttajalle/koordinaattimuunnokset

My question is, is this kind of transformation something that could be implemented inside PROJ at some point in the future? I don't know if this kind of thing is used anywhere else so it might be that this has very little use outside of Finland.

If this isn't viable, are there any plans about plugin support for PROJ? It would be cool to be able to implement custom steps and represent them as part of the normal PROJ pipeline to implement special needs :-)

Thanks!

Best regards,

I'm currently working with National Land Survey of Finland to bring those transformations 
into PROJ. So stay tuned. Should come in coming weeks / months. Triangulation-based 
transformations are likely of interest in other cases too as a number of grid-based 
transformations come initially from triangulations.

I can see pros & cons to a plugin approach. From a community point of view, plugins tend to 
"isolate" people. Sometimes what one thinks to be a custom need can be useful for others.

Hi Even,

You working with NLS sounds really wonderful! This is great news :-)

Is there somewhere I could follow progress on this? Is there any way I could help to make this happen?

I agree with your comment about plugins. But still, sometimes they would be very handy. :-)

All,

The release of PROJ 7.1.0 is coming up on July 1st. We can’t have a new release without at
least one release candidate. I have prepared release candidates for both the PROJ and PROJ-data
packages. Download them here:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-7.1.0RC1.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-7.1.0RC1.zip
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-data-1.1RC1.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-data-1.1RC1.zip

As usual everyone who uses PROJ is encouraged to try out the release candidates and report
back their experiences either here on the mailing list or in the issue tracker on GitHub.

As I will go on my summer vacation this weekend Even will do the finishing touches on this release.

There are unstable symbols:

_ZL21approx_e_fwd_internal5PJ_LPP8PJconsts._GLOBAL___projections_tmerc.cpp_FB5499C7_0x31c32e46ecd103d0.ifunc at Base

These get added with new hex values for every build.

Should these be exported?

Kind Regards,

Bas

No, they are internal symbols to tmerc.cpp

There are due to 2 functions tagged with

These results do not match those obtained with an explicit formulation of this CRS:

$ cs2cs +init=epsg:4326 +to +proj=igh +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs wgs.md
-1499101.98 1669792.36 0.00
19480910.89 0.00 0.00
16105847.11 3896182.18 0.00
12540237.72 6049791.84 0.00
-14174481.82 5536683.82 0.00

The differences are all with easting coordinates, making me suspect that something was amiss with lobe definitions. Therefore I went checking in the database:

spatialite> SELECT text_definition FROM projected_crs WHERE code=54052;
PROJCS["World_Goode_Homolosine_Land",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Goode_Homolosine"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",0.0],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian", 0.0],PARAMETER["Option",1.0],UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

The "Goode_Homolosine" projection name refers to this class:
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/46c47e9adf6376ae06afabe5d24a0016a05ced82/src/projections/goode.cpp

It defines no lobes and does not correspond to any of the projections proposed by Goode. I believe this CRS WKT should instead refer to the actual Homolosine for land masses, identifiable with the long name "Interrupted Goode Homolosine" and the short id "igh":
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/f3561e5749fefd957f67cc631378d1c39161a310/docs/source/operations/projections/igh.rst

Also inquiring the database, one can note the Oceanic version also referring to the rogue lobe-less projection:

spatialite> SELECT text_definition FROM projected_crs WHERE code=54053;
PROJCS["World_Goode_Homolosine_Ocean",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",637137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Goode_Homolosine"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",0.0],PARAMETER["False_Northing",0.0],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian" ,-160.0],PARAMETER["Option",2.0],UNIT["Meter",1.0]]

In this case the right projection should possibly be the one named "Oceanic view":
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/blob/2e5470387df8c713af18e601c0e6a4b352294556/docs/source/operations/projections/igh_o.rst

I hope this makes sense. Thank you.

Hi Even,

that was really fast, thank you. I should now help with the testing, at least these CRSs.

You didn't specify which PROJ version you use, but I suspect this must be PROJ 4 or 5 from 
the debug traces.

With latest PROJ, it will return an error in that situation (at least on a case where I tried to 
simulate yours)

With PROJ master:

$ echo -50 -50 | cs2cs +proj=longlat +nadgrids=ntf_r93.gsb +to  +proj=longlat +nadgrids=null
*	* inf

vs PROJ 4.9.2

$ echo -50 -50 | cs2cs +proj=longlat +nadgrids=ntf_r93.gsb +to  +proj=longlat +nadgrids=null
50dW	50dS 0.000

Subject: [PROJ] How to write LAS points in N-E CRS
Message-ID: <CADRrdKtGtnY-31V7oixF0D76o6A=heDu+oJYw7ak1EdTr2SDTQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am writing a LAS file using a Northing-Easting CRS (EPSG:2384 for
instance).

I am not sure in which order I should write the point coordinates:
northing-easting-up or easting-northing-up.
* The first option (northing-easting-up) is "consistent" with the
definition of the CRS. However it needs to understand the axes of the CRS
(is this only possible in WKT2?), and operate the values to display them on
the screen. Otherwise you will see a reflected image.
* The second option (easting-northing-up) is much easier to represent in
the screen. And seems to be what many programs are doing/expecting.
However, it is inconsistent with the CRS definition.

I don't find anything about that in LAS specs.

What should I do?

Should I write the WKT string in WKT1 or WKT2 format? if WKT1, with or
without axes?

The same question could apply to ShapeFiles.

projinfo EPSG:2384 -o WKT1:GDAL
WKT1:GDAL string:
PROJCS["Xian 1980 / 3-degree Gauss-Kruger CM 117E",
    GEOGCS["Xian 1980",
        DATUM["Xian_1980",

            AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],

Javier,

Unfortunately there are not many satisfactory answers for you. The 1.4 LAS specification is deficient in that it says nothing about allowing any future versions of WKT, and it should be assumed that clients are only going to be able to consume WKT1:GDAL when writing data. I have attempted to start the wheels in motion to spin up the committee for another revision of the LAS specification to address this issue [1]. LAS 1.4 is going to be especially challenging in situations where orthometric data are written into time-dependent coordinates because there will be no way to communicate it. With the NGS delaying their rollout in the US, the immediate pressure caused by this need may have lessened, however.

I think the pragmatic answer to your question is to chose the latter approach, and then deal with the consequences once it is possible to more accurately model the axes in WKT2.

Shapefile .prj uses ESRI WKT1, which is even older than GDAL WKT1 
and has no way to convey axis definition. The tradition seems to 
always write coordinates in easting, northing  / longitude,latitude 
order even when the full EPSG definition mentions the reverse 
order.
