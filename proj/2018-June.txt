Based on the activity criteria, I think it is only fair to include Kurt Schwehr
In the PSC as well. Over the last 6 to 12 months Kurt has done a
tremendous job on improving the robustness of the PROJ code base
as well taking on the dirty job of improving the overall state of the
code.
So if Kurt is interested, I would like to nominate him as a
member of the bootstrapped PSC.

+1 on Howard's suggestion for a PROJ PSC

and

+1 for Frank's third scenario ("We might want to consider the MetaCRS
"experiment" to have run it's course and not worked out particularly well
and dissolve MetaCRS other than perhaps as a potentially mailing list for
coordination of related projects, and proceed with PROJ.4 as an independent
project with it's own PSC, etc.").

Especially, I think we should keep the MetaCRS mailing list (or something
equivalent), since I believe it to be the right place to discuss, develop
and (to some degree) distribute test and validations material for
transformations. I do not think we have seen much development in the IOGP
GIGS test material the last few years, so it is probably not terribly well
curated for the moment. Compiling an alternative, with wider coverage and
in a more accessible format, will be of interest to any provider of
transformation software, not just PROJ.

Subject: [Proj] Migration from travis-ci.org to travis-ci.com
Message-ID: <2999508.QGZ0W74Rr0@even-i700>

Hi,

Thanks to OSGeo financial support, repositories under the OSGeo github 
organizations have now a maximum 13 concurrent jobs available on travis-ci.com

Note that the builds are now on the .com domain, and no longer on the .org. 
This is related to their on-going migration from the .org to the .com. The 
logs of the builds on .org are still available, but no new builds won't be 
triggered on the .org now.

So head to:

	https://travis-ci.com/OSGeo/gdal/
	https://travis-ci.com/OSGeo/proj.4/

Awesome. That should speed things up a bunch! Thanks for taking care of this.

Maybe related to this change, I have noticed that the website is not being deployed properly at the moment. That is, it isn’t being deployed at all. Previously this has been caused by failure to generate the PDF docs but I can’t find any hints in the logs that that is the problem. I am wondering if maybe the switch to the .com domain has had an effect on the deploy key or something like that?

ah indeed, they warned me that the settings are lost during the migration, so 
they key should be re-installed / re-generated.

I indeed see 2 (hidden) encrypted environement variables at
https://travis-ci.org/OSGeo/proj.4/settings
but none at
https://travis-ci.com/OSGeo/proj.4/settings

Looking at travis/add_deploy_key.sh, I guess they are the secret elements to 
be able to decode the encrypted RSA private key associated with the "proj.4 
deploybot" fake user.

It looks like it is Howard that has the needed elements to reinstall them.

All,

https://proj4.org/community/rfc/rfc-1.html <https://proj4.org/community/rfc/rfc-1.html> proposes the rules and guidelines under which the PROJ Project Steering Committee will operate. The substantive text of the RFC is from MapServer's document [1], which has guided the MapServer and GDAL projects for more than ten years.

I'll start with a +1 to approve.

Howard

I suggest to correct the specific term CVS to the more generic VCS. But
otherwise, I'm +1.

+1 Frank

I would suggest the "It is anticipated that separate “committees” will
exist to manage conferences, documentation and web sites. That said, it is
expected that the PSC will be the entity largely responsible for creating
any such committees." could be omitted since I don't really think we
anticipate that in the context of a smallish project like PROJ.

Best regards,
Frank

That's all fine - I was just wondering if the metacrs notion extended to
proj operating as part of osgeo in a legal sense, in terms of being able
to process contributions as 501c3 etc.

Sure, that's also fine, and separable from the legal organization
question.


I have been dealing with proj for a very long time, and am glad that it
is continuing in a healthy manner.

Dear Howard,

can you provide the units for a "very long time"?

Unfortunately what I see is a visionless PSC. I see developers and I see a
respected cataloger of grids with knowledge of algorithms.
What I don't see is a vision for the future, lists of requirements,
representatives of the user community and a lack of Product Management
processes including the method of choosing PSC members. Where are the
requirements for a PSC? What talents do you need for an effective PSC?
Currently I see a stampede, let's act before we think, let's vote before we
decide the rules. When I see program management like this I automatically
expect long term failure. If you are not inclusive you omit the majority of
interested parties. I have no interest in joining the PSC. I have over 55
years of developing, using, maintaining Projection software within batch
and real-time mapping and  navigation software. Much of my software was
distributed with DOD, DMA and Minerals Management. Some of it came back to
me after I moved to a Major Oil Company. Derivatives still exist in
military equipment. Some small piece ended up in the first commercial GPS
system.

The Oil industry has problems with all current commercial Projection
software because of fundamental problems related to legal ownership as
things change.

So you can continue on with this process with or without thinking, the
choice is yours,

Huw James

Huw,

Howard's proposal is following the pattern for a variety of other projects
in the open source geospatial world.  The RFC speaks briefly to some
expectations, but there is also a broader "defacto practice" for project
management within OSGeo and in the broader open source world.  I think it
is valuable to think of this as formalizing a few parts of that - in
particular a mechanism to resolve disputes should they arise.

I think Howard, Even, Kristian and others have expressed useful future
directions here on this list, and in the "GDAL Barn Raising" initiative.
Also the overall goal of the project is on the web page "a C API for
software developers to include coordinate transformation in their own
software.".

For a relatively modest sized open source project, expecting formal program
management in the sense it is "enjoyed" by better funded projects and those
done in other development context is - IMHO - impractical. The PSC exists
to ensure that interested developers who want to contribute can do so on a
fairly even playing field, and with a mechanism to resolve radically
incompatible approaches.  That aside, things will mostly move forward
according to the needs of developers who contribute and as the first order
users of PROJ are mostly developers themselves I think that can work
reasonably well.

I also don't think that this is happening in a "stampede".  Aspects of this
have been a topic at conferences for many years, and it is following a well
established pattern.

Note that legal ownership of the code is still in the hands of the original
developers (as is the default with copyright) and use rights are implicit
in the open source license it was contributed under.  The PSC exists to try
and manage a consensus model around the development of what will hopefully
be the most widely accepted branch of the software.  Ultimately forking can
still happen.

Trying to provide a little Emeritus institutional memory to justify my
presence on the PSC. :-)

Best regards,
Frank

It is my understanding that OSGeo isn't a non-profit 501c3, but instead is a 501c4, which means its contributions are generally not deductible. That status wasn't settled when MetaCRS was formed. PROJ itself had never incubated into OSGeo, and PROJ has never had governance beyond a benevolent dictator (Frank).

Hi,

to conclude that thread, we finally decided for Google Test. Now both 
integrated with automake & cmake.

Folks,

I'm declaring the motion to form the PROJ PSC under RFC 1
https://proj4.org/community/rfc/rfc-1.html passed. As described in the
RFC, substantive changes, improvements, infrastructure modification,
or incompatible behavior choices should follow the RFC process going
forward.

I will follow up with a motion to the OSGeo MetaCRS list detaching
PROJ from its governance prerogative.

Howard

Thanks Even, Mat, and all,

I will keep writing more tests as I get time.

For the record, code in gdal-autotest2 is under Apache 2.0.  When I commit
that code to PROJ it will still be copyright google, but it will be under
that PROJ license as documented in
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/COPYING

I will follow the file top comment style that Even did in basic_test.cpp.

Subject: [Proj] Lagrange Polyconic Inverse Projection
Message-ID: <CAJ==wh7sHVrrs=ksfLZr-D2rQ1UwuVHMJkt2uwJikink9v3xbQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
sometimes I look into the source code of the proj4 to get an
inspiration for my own private project.

This time I needed the Lagrange Polyconic Inverse Projection, which is not
included in the proj4 source code, so I wrote it myself.

I want to contribute the code to you (see attachment), perhaps somebody
finds it useful. I tried to adapt the coding style to the original file,
but I never compiled it.

If someone Needs support, please contact me.

Sorry for my english, Michael.

Thank you, Michael!

I’ve added your code in this pull request on GitHub https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1058
If the tests pass I’ll merge it into master.
