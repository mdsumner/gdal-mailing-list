Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Conversion between Geographic CS's
Message-ID: <3D9B94F6.5090202@iscte.pt>

Hi.

First of all, I must say I have never used PROJ.4 before. I am posting 
to this list because I am a user of PostGIS, which uses PROJ.4 to 
perform transformations between Coordinate Systems (CS).

In PostGis, there is a transform function that is supposed to transform 
between any kind of CS. As far as I have understood, the conversion 
between projected CS's works fine, but now I am trying to convert 
between geodetic CS's and everything is going wrong...

So, my questions to you would be:
- is it possible to convert between geodetic CS's?
- is this very different from converting between projected CS's?

I am sorry to post such a simple question, but I don't seem to 
understand much from the online documentation...

Bye and thanks in advance

Luis,

By geodetic, I gather you mean lat/long coordinate system normally in degrees
based on an ellipsoid and a datum?

These would normally be described in PROJ.4 with a "known" datum like:

  +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84

or with a user defined datum (3 or 7 parameter transform) based on an
ellipsoid defined something like:

  +proj=latlong +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=2,5,-15

I hope this helps.

Best regards,

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] datums transormation and dX dY dZ values
Message-ID: <001e01c26aa6$1ba811b0$cbfb623e@laptop>

Hi all
I'm not a very expert in datums shift and projections so, eventually, I'm sorry for my basic question.  
I have a map where are drawed the grids in two different datums Gauss Boaga (Rome 40 datum) and UTM (eur50 datum). I'm not sure that parameters (dx dy dz) for the datum shift indicated in the internal datum tables or epsg or NIMA  tables are very good for my little area of work so I would like know if is it possible desume (and in which way) my user defined dx dy dz for the molodensky datum shift R40 --> ED50  directly from the two grids drawed onto map or if I need of other parameters?
Many thanks in advance.
Giorgio.

Luis,

I have moved this discussion to the PROJ.4 mailing list, since that is
more appropriate.

PROJ.4 is indeed a C library and you are certainly welcome to prepare a
patch yourself.  If so, please attach the completed and tested patch to
the bug report and I will (after a bit of review) apply it to the core.

If you want to do this, please prepare the patch against the current CVS
version of PROJ.4.  Various information about PROJ.4, including anonymous
CVS access to the source is available at:

   http://www.remotesensing.org/proj

One concern I have is whether the prime meridian should be considered to
have any relationship to longitude parameters for a projection.  For
instance, if a TM projection uses a geographic coordinate system with a
Lisbon prime meridian, is the central meridian supposed to be specified as
degrees from Lisbon or Greenwich?  What is common practice?

For practical purposes in PROJ.4 I would have preferred that prime meridian
issues remain completely divorced from the projection routines (pj_fwd,
pj_inv) and only addressed at the point where transations are done from one
lat/long coordinate system to another.  But this sort of implies that all
longitude parameters to a projection with an alternate prime meridian are
implicitly relative to that pm ... that may be a peculiar convetion.

I would like the feedback of the PROJ.4 community on this issue before we
commit to an approach to prime meridian support.

Cursed colonial countries! :) Henceforth I am going to declare the 
Ramsey GEOGCS to be a GRS80 ellipsoid with Victoria as a the PRIMEM!

PROJCS["Portuguese_National_Grid",GEOGCS["GCS_Lisbon_Lisbon",DATUM["D_Lisbon",SPHEROID["International_1924",6378388,297]],PRIMEM["Lisbon",-9.131906111111112],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["False_Easting",200000],PARAMETER["False_Northing",300000],PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",1],PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",1],PARAMETER["Latitude_Of_Origin",39.66666666666666],UNIT["Meter",1]]

This example appears to use the declared PRIMEM (Lisbon) as the 
parameter in the Transverse_Mercator projection following. Personally, I 
think that makes sense -- the GEOGCS is declared because it 
contextualizes the planar projection which follows, both in terms of 
ellipsoid used and also in terms of origin of parameters.

This is an easy question , I think. Both alternatives are possible, but, 
as far as I remember, both EPSG and the ISO TC 211 (which deals with GI) 
speak of the 'greenwich longitude', which, in the case of the lisbon 
meridian, and as you can check in 
http://gdal.velocet.ca/cgi-bin/csv2html/TABLE=p_meridian/CODE=8902/, sth 
like -9.07. This means that this meridian is west of greenwich.

Seems a good idea to me.

Yes, it's better to do it that way.

Anyway, in the meantime, I would like to take a look at the code to see 
if I understand it. Would you kindly point out what is function that 
addresses GCS to GCS conversion?

Luis,

If this is the case, the pj_fwd() and pj_inv() function which map from
projected coordinates to lat/long in the same GCS would need to take
the prime meridian into account as well.  As I think about it, this isn't
really such a terribly hard thing to do and would be worthwhile to avoid
disconnects with EPSG, ISO and OGC standard data models.

> Anyway, in the meantime, I would like to take a look at the code to see

I believe you will want to insert the prime meridian support in
pj_transform() in src/pj_transform.c.  Depending on our approach above,
the pj_inv() and pj_fwd() functions may also require prime meridian support.

I would suggest that the prime meridian should be parsed out by pj_init()
and placed as a new field in the PJ structure defined in projects.h.  Perhaps
just under the "int islat_long" flag.

Best regards,

Here's my two cents worth of opinion on this topic:

The defining parameters of a classical horizontal geodetic datum are:

Astronomic Latitude of the origin,
Astronomic Longitude of the origin,
Ellipsoid Semi-major Axis,
Ellipsoid Semi-minor Axis or Reciprocal of Flattening,
Astronomic Azimuth from origin to another point,
Deflection of the Vertical in the N-S direction,
Deflection of the Vertical in the E-W direction,
Ellipsoid Height of the origin,
Elevation of the origin (or Geoid Height/separation)

The first five of the above are ALWAYS defined.  The remainder are used
with mature datums that generally have been through at least one iteration
within a country.  Many times they are equated to zero, at least on the
first set of datum defining parameters.

Now please notice the second parameter listed above.  It is the Astronomic
Longitude of the origin.  If that value is zero for a country, then by
definition it is that country's Prime Meridian for that country's datum.
Therefore, ALL cartographic coordinate systems that are on that datum use
that point as the Prime Meridian.

However, if a classical datum DOES use a Prime Meridian other than the
Conventional International Origin (CIO) corresponding to Herstmonceaux
Castle at Greenwich, England; a geodetic transformation from that classical
datum to say, WGS84 Datum requires a FOUR-parameter shift.  The fourth
parameter then is an initial rotation about the polar axis to come into
coincidence with Greenwich.

The most common "other" Prime Meridians used are Paris & Ferro (Canary
Islands), but over a dozen of others exist.  As more individuals from all
over the world become users of this "PROJ4" system; the need for such
accommodation will certainly increase.

The primary coordinate system within a country is the DATUM.  Projections
are ALWAYS secondary whenever coordinate precision of a position is better
than 100 meters. In other words, if tens of meters or meters make a
difference in the data set; you have to worry about this stuff.

So there.  Whew!

Just as an aside from the original author of proj.4:  prime meridian has no place
in
proj.4.  Any offsets in longitude due to variations in coordinate system "prime
meridian" should be taken care of externally with adjustments to "lon_0"
parameter.

My probem is that I view the projections and their math as pristene entities  and
not disturbed with regtional egos and their arbitrary orientations of coordinate
systems.

I know my advice will be ignored but I could not resist expressing my displeasure
with the inclusion of PM code within the proj.4 library.  PMS, if you will.

You cite the srtext definition in the spatial_ref_sys table:

However, when I looked at the definition found in 
http://gdal.velocet.ca/cgi-bin/csv2html/TABLE=p_meridian/CODE=8902/, the 
value for the prime meridian is -9.0754862. Which one is right? I don't 
have the EPSG data here to check it out (I have no application to read 
an Access DB... What idea is this to publish EPSG data in Access format?)

Louis,

The definition for the Lisbon Prime Meridian in EPSG is declared to be
in sexagesimal degrees (DD.MMSSsss) so the value of -9.0754862 should
be interpreted as -9d7m54.862s or -9.0 - 7.0/60 - 54.862/3600 which
works out to -9.13190611111 which closely matches the WKT definition which
is in decimal degrees.  Lots of gotchas in extracting data from the EPSG
tables!

Note that I think Pauls point in quoting the WKT was to show that the
Central Meridian parameter to the Transverse Mercator projection (which was 1)
is likely relative to the Lisbon prime meridian, not to Greenwich, otherwise
the central meridian would be a long ways away from Portugal.  An unlikey
choice for a national coordinate system.

So based on that one example, I would say that the longitude parameters
for projections are usually expressed relative to the prime meridian of
the GCS, not greenwich.  Based on that we could say that the pj_inv() and
pj_fwd() function would not need to be changed as they operate in local
GCS space and are "unaware" of their prime meridian.  Furthermore, all
longitude parameters passed to PROJ.4 would be interpreted as relative to
the prime meridian in effect.  The +pm parameter would only be needed when
desiring to convert between different geographic coordinate systems.

 > What idea is this to publish EPSG data in Access format?

The use of Access makes it easy to implement a nice GUI front end, and to
more clearly express the connections in the data model.   I personally don't
like it because it depends on proprietary software, and puts non-Windows
users a step away from the original source data which is why I provide
a program for dumping the tables to text files for the use of libgeotiff
and GDAL.  However, there are good and practical (if arguable not good
enough) reasons why EPSG did as they did.

Gerald,

Certainly this is how people have dealt with this issue in the past, and it
works fine when PROJ.4 is just used for projections.

Well, the corruption started when I introduced support for converting
between different datums. At that point I was trying to make PROJ.4 into
a coordinate system conversion library rather than just a projections
library.  I can see why you feel that is a perversion of the original vision
of PROJ.4, and the focus of it's role, but that is the danger of open source.
Your work can be adopted an taken in directions you never intended.

That said, I think PROJ.4 is serving an important function for lots of other
projects by taking on the larger role of coordinate systems conversion and
that integrating that task in one library rather than two layered libraries
has some benefits.

Your advice isn't exactly disregarded ... your vision messages cause me lots of
angst!  It just that user demand (and my own needs) has led me to take PROJ.4
in a different direction than originally intended.  Obviously we all owe you
alot as you did all the hard work ... the stuff that I am far from competent
to do.  But in the end, I will still pursue the features I think are useful
and needed.

When the late John P. Snyder and I started corresponding, cartography was
still just a hobby for the Chemical Engineer and datum transformations were
an oddity in Geodesy that was rarely encountered outside of Military
Geodesy.  The Navy Transit Doppler satellite program was still classified
(WGS72), and every country in the world was still doing classical geodesy
with theodolites except for the militaries of the U.S., U.K., Canada, and
Australia.  The "distinction" between Cartography & projections versus
Geodesy and datums was quite clear.

Times have changed, and "GIS" people don't only want to work in one
reference frame - the digitized paper map.  People want to make a
connection between their digitized/scanned data and stuff they can gather
themselves with a shirt-pocket satellite receiver.  People have always
wanted to do that sort of thing; the difference is that they can now go out
and purchase the hardware tools that are in stock on someone's store shelf!

Times change, and old traditions (and software) must yield to reality or be
left in the dust.

I generally remain silent on changes to proj.4 and try to limit comments to
places where I feel things are going a little too astray.  But in all cases, please
take the comments as friendly suggestions.  I consider the version of proj.4
you and your group is distributing yours and these suggestions are only to remind
you that I'm still looking  over your shoulders.

Hi Giorgio,

I think that

cs2cs +init=epsg:26591 +towgs84=-225,-65,9 +to +init=epsg:23032

should do the job (R40 --> ED50).

Note that epsg:26591 does not contain the Rome datum, that's why
I used '+towgs84=-225,-65,9' here.

The underlying values are stored in the PROJ4 source code (nad/epgs file)
and 
/usr/local/share/proj/epsg
or whereever you installed PROJ4.

Note also that GRASS's [mrs].proj do not (yet) perform datums shift except
for NAD, at time (I hope) the code upgrade is ongoing within the
GRASS 5 libraries.

Hope this helps, please verify above with some known points
and post the results.

Best regards,

# f: Monte Mario (Rome) / Italy zone 1
# t: ED50 / UTM zone 32N
cs2cs +init=epsg:26591 +towgs84=-225,-65,9 +to +init=epsg:23032

Herstmonceux Castle is in Herstmonceux, Sussex (50.9N 0.3E), which is

The Royal Observatory was originally in Greenwich; it moved to
Herstmonceux shortly after WW2, but the meridian stayed put.

lon_0=5.38763888888888 k=0.9999079 x_0=155000 y_0=463000

ellps=bessel

At the time i checked this (over a year ago) i remember there was a problem
with the 5/7 parameter datum shifts, i discussed this with frank, who may
have fixed that in a later release. (?)

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Problem in geodesic to planar conversion
Message-ID: <sdaffcdd.068@isagri.fr>

I want to convert geodesic coordinates from a GPS to planar coordinates in Lambert 2 étendu system. So my GPS coordinates are in WGS84 geodesic system and when I apply my projection, the planar coordinates result are the same as I have my GPS coordinates in a NTF geodesic system and my planar coordinates are approximatively 40 meters horizontal shift.


My question is, how can I specify the source geodesic system in start of proj ?

The use of proj :

static char *parms[] = {"proj=lcc","ellps=clrk80","lat_0=46d8'0.0\"",
                                       "lon_0=2d20'14.025\"","lat_1=41d33'37.00\"",
                                       "lat_2=47d41'45.65\"","x_0=600000.0","y_0=2200000.0"};
    ...
    putenv ("PROJ_LIB=C:\\Temp\\proj-4.4.3\\ess");
    if (ref = pj_init(sizeof(parms)/sizeof(char*), parms))
       {
       data.u *= DEG_TO_RAD;       // latitude
       data.v *=  DEG_TO_RAD;      // longitude
       data = pj_fwd(data, ref);
       ...


Thanks to help me

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Elliptical orthographic projection ?
In-Reply-To: <sdaffcdd.068@isagri.fr>
Message-ID: <4.3.2.7.2.20021025161154.03ef9d98@localhost>

Hello all !

First I'd like to thanks the developers & contributors to this library that 
saved me quite a lot of work !

I'm using Proj4 in an astronomy project where I'm actually going from the 
orthographic projection (as seen by my telescope) to a cylindrical 
projection. Unfortunatly elliptical projection is not available for the 
orthographic projection and considering how flat is, for instance,  Jupiter 
(10%) the projection is lacking precision...

So the question is : Did anyone developed an elliptical orthographic 
projection that he would be happy to share or does anyone have some advices 
related to this problem ?


Thanks in advance,

			Xavier
