Hi,

Is there any importance for the order of the parameters in a projstring CRS
definition?

Is there a function that compares projstrings that takes into consideration
that two projstrings can be equal even if the strings are not exactly the
same?

Kind regards,
Idan

For a single step pipeline, no. But starting with PROJ 5, it you use a 
proj=pipeline, yes the order of steps matter.

For single-step proj strings and currently released versions, using GDAL with 
OSRImportFromProj4() + OSRIsSame() will do

If you use PROJ master, you can equivalently use 
proj_create_from_proj_string() + proj_is_equivalent_to(). Note that this will 
work as you mentionned only for single-step strings. (For multiple steps, this 
will mostly be equivalent to exact string comparisons)

Also remember to take pipeline globals into account: proj=pipeline
ellps=GRS80 step ... step... will set ellps=GRS80 for all steps due to the
definition being put before first step definition

Subject: [PROJ] Unable to load proj.dll in to MapInfo softver
Message-ID: <002501d4a35c$5685e040$0391a0c0$@posta.rs>

For the past period We used MapInfo 8.5, now we upgrade it to v17.1.0. In
old version of MapInfo we used proj4 ( <https://proj4.org/> PROJ - PROJ.4
5.2.0 documentation) opensource program to transform coordinate from Gauss
to WGS84 and reverse, but the same project issue doesn't work on new version
of MapInfo softver.
I recompile new version the opensource proj4 in x86, using VS17, but I still
have a problem to load in MapInfo v17.1.0, in this case MapInfo expected x32
library but when I put x32 library I have the same error.
Also I download OseGeo package x64 where is new x86 proj.dll but in that
case when I call this project MapInfo stop responding.



Help me If you can to solve this problem.

Message-ID: <CAB28AsjsOXKq1DTwrrvwLMEucu+5EFKQSfZdYXaVtr3bb_Ke4g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

It's my understanding that this is only possible with the Proj 5
pipeline API and the new helmert transform, but just in case:

Is it possible in proj v4 to define a custom projection, based on a
utm/tmerc projection, with a custom rotation applied? (and if so,
what's the syntax for this?)

Thanks!
Nyall

If omerc is the answer to the question have a look at this issue https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/523 <https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/523>
which goes into details with the quirks of this projection. I am afraid the documentation isn’t very helpful
at this time.

If omerc isn’t what you need, take a look at ob_tran: https://proj4.org/operations/projections/ob_tran.html <https://proj4.org/operations/projections/ob_tran.html>

Good Morning,

I need the compiled .dll for the highest versioning level of PROJ4 which I believe is Version 4.9.3.  Please let me know if this can be provided to me.  I have downloaded the source code but am uncomfortable compiling it.  The directions are not very clear to me.

Hi,

You can get the latest Windows binaries for 4.9.3 as well as for 5.2 from
the OSGeo4W setup:

You're welcome.
You could always use depends (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) to know a
DLL's dependencies.
OSGeo4W also downloads for you the dependencies along with the latest
version.
Thus I advise you to use the OSGeo4W installer.
As per your question, the x64 version depends on MSVCR100.DLL, which can be
downloaded also from here:
http://www.norbit.de/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/msvcrt/msvcrt2010/msvcrt2010-1.0.0-1.tar.bz2
(which would be the file that the OSGeo4W installer would download for you)

On a side note. I find that the DependencyWalker is horribly slow. I’m now using this one

 

https://github.com/lucasg/Dependencies

 

that is blazingly fast.

You're welcome.

You could always use depends (http://www.dependencywalker.com/) to know a DLL's dependencies.

OSGeo4W also downloads for you the dependencies along with the latest version.

Thus I advise you to use the OSGeo4W installer.

As per your question, the x64 version depends on MSVCR100.DLL, which can be downloaded also from here:

http://www.norbit.de/osgeo4w/x86_64/release/msvcrt/msvcrt2010/msvcrt2010-1.0.0-1.tar.bz2

(which would be the file that the OSGeo4W installer would download for you)

PSC members,

RFC3 about dependency management has been up for review for quite some time now. Since no comments has been reviewed since the last I update I regard this as ready for a vote by the PSC.

The RFC is available here: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1168 <https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1168> 

I’ll start with my +1.

Subject: [PROJ] Closing in on the release of PROJ 6
Message-ID: <2E885BB293AF0448A0181138489E9A0EAEFEDF90@S000014.PROD.SITAD.DK>

All,

Today we are one and a half month away from the scheduled release of PROJ 6. This release is going to be a giant leap forwards in terms of handling of CRS metadata and determination of transformations between systems. I am looking forward to the final release and all the new functionality it brings to the world!

With the release date closing in it also means that now is the time to wrap up any outstanding work that is left to do before release. I plan to the first release candidate February 15th, which leaves exactly one month to wrap things up. On GitHub I have catalogued issues I think thought be handled before the release. See the list here https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/milestones/6.0.0. It mostly concern updates to the documentation and the CMake build system. I would like to ask PROJ developers to please try to find the time to resolve those issues in time for the release candidate. If that is not possible we will need to consider postponing the release as I regard most of the issues in the list as blocking issues for the upcoming release.

Best regards,
Kristian

Subject: [PROJ] Do you use Chebyshev polynomial coeffiecient approximations
	in proj?
Message-ID: <2D4EF68D-D274-46F8-851B-26EBE90130F3@gmail.com>

All,

I am contemplating removing the Chebyshev polynomial coefficient
approximation functionality of the proj utility [0]. I suspect that it hasn’t
been used seriously by anyone for the last 20-25 years. Projections
aren’t that expensive to compute by modern standards so there is
simply no need to approximate them. So I’d like to remove the
functionality. There’s no need to waste ressources on maintaining
code and documentation that in all likelihood is not used anymore.

Before I go ahead and remove the code I want to check with the list
if anyone still has a need for this? If no-one responds positively to that
I am going to remove the code at the end of this week.

Just to react on this, and not on the Chebyshev specific case, coordinate 
transformation can be a significant CPU eater. For example in the case of 
gdalwarp, a piece-wise affine approximation is used by default to save CPU 
cycles and avoid doing coordinate transformation for potentially billion of 
pixels.

No objection from me. Never used it. Didn't know that it existed.

Hi,

there's a point that came to mind suddenly. About C99 adoption, that mean that 
we could use the 'bool' type in the C API for example. Do we want to do that ? 
The adverse consequence would be for third-party code using PROJ API and 
building with C89 only.

Well, we *could* do that, but since we already have a few functions that return int
instead of bool it would be more consistent to continue that pattern. I don't have
strong opinion on the matter. I am curious to know though if there is any users
of PROJ following the list that has a strict C89 requirement?

Hi,

there's a point that came to mind suddenly. About C99 adoption, that mean that 
we could use the 'bool' type in the C API for example. Do we want to do that ? 
The adverse consequence would be for third-party code using PROJ API and 
building with C89 only.

Most of the code is now compiled as C++ so probably not a big issue in practical terms. Also, we do run all code through several msvc versions on AppVeyor so any non-msvs compliant code we may write should be discovered quickly. Code not passing the tests on AppVeyor should of course not be merged.

As far as I understand the material from Microsoft, they support a large subset of C99 but some lesser used features aren’t available. Getting a list of exactly what is and what isn’t supported is not easy to find though.

Just to be clear, I have no intention of updating the RFC as it is now. I don’t think the concerns raised here are incompatible with the content of RFC3.

Yes and no. My point was that, in the current state of PROJ master, people can 
for example use a separately compiled PROJ with whatever "modern" compiler we 
require (or use a PROJ binary from their prefered packaging), but still 
wanting to use the PROJ C API with their own build constraints, like enforcing 
-std=c89 in their code base, and thus including proj.h with non-C89 features 
would break that.

RFC3 is fine for me as a general strategy. This is just a example of practical 
concrete decisions.
I've sticked to using int in the new C API I've added in cases where bool 
might have been used.

Thanks, Even, for elaborating on all the stuff I thought and meant, but
didn't mention. It was exactly my main concern, that the interface should
probably be kept C89(C90)-compatible for quite a while. The
library-internal code, since compiled as C++, can wiggle a lot more. All in
all going C++11 is a huge improvement, as long as we can keep the C ABI/API
reasonably stable/accessible from C and from projects expecting a C ABI.

RFC3 is perfectly fine as is, but proj.h and the ABI and API it exposes
needs special care. With that in mind, it is as Kristian indicates: A lot
of C99 considerations are more or less irrelevant now that we compile
everything as C++11.

Yes, I agree that we should stay on the conservative side with regards to the API. How about we set up tests on travis and appveyor that checks that the API can be used in a strictly C89 application? Perhaps also a similar thing for the C++ API.

I think it's very important that the library can continue to be used
from C.  But I wonder how much C89 matters, vs C99?   In headers,
though, I'm not sure how much more C89 hurts.

aren’t that expensive to compute by modern standards so there is
simply no need to approximate them.

Just to react on this, and not on the Chebyshev specific case, coordinate
transformation can be a significant CPU eater. For example in the case of
gdalwarp, a piece-wise affine approximation is used by default to save CPU
cycles and avoid doing coordinate transformation for potentially billion of
pixels.

So I’d like to remove the
functionality. There’s no need to waste ressources on maintaining
code and documentation that in all likelihood is not used anymore.

Before I go ahead and remove the code I want to check with the list
if anyone still has a need for this? If no-one responds positively to that
I am going to remove the code at the end of this week.

No objection from me. Never used it. Didn't know that it existed.

Subject: [PROJ] Help understanding grid files and +towgs84
Message-ID: <CAAi8Yg_Uy5uEEtR5PBaq1WuV7ZMEGKxiBU8KuNqHANzNx2t1dQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

So I'm mainly just trying to understand how and why this works just for my
own knowledge.

I'm currently working on a GDA94 > GDA2020 transform project and noticed
that the proj4 string that ships with everything (GDAL, QGIS, PostGIS) only
has +proj=utm +zone=55 +south +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs but in order
to get the transform to work correctly I need to add the grid to the source
and the +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 to the target (GDA2020) proj4 sring.

ogr2ogr command was:

ogr2ogr -s_srs "+proj=utm +zone=55 +south +ellps=GRS80
+towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs +wktext
 +nadgrids=C:\temp\GDA94_GDA2020_conformal.gsb"
-t_srs "+proj=utm +zone=55 +south +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0
+units=m +no_defs +wktext" out.shp in.shp

Now I'm just trying to understand mainly:

1) Why is +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 needed on the target? As if it's not there
it will just return the same values as the input
2) Why is that not included as default?
3) Is my understanding of the following correct?  Proj is really doing:
GDA94 -> WGS84 -> Shifted WGS84 via grid -> GDA2020?

Thanks,
Nathan

Hi Nathan,


1)      cs2cs, and the underlying pj_transform(), need this to know that it should do a datum-shift. You need either a +datum, +towgs84 or a +nadgrids parameter set on both source and target.

2)      Optimization – The alternative is to perform a 7-parameter shift for every possible coordinate transformation.

3)      Yes.

This all happen in parts of PROJ that can be considered legacy code. As you may know we are in the process of giving PROJ a big overhaul that, amongst other things, are meant to make things like this more transparent. From PROJ v. 6 and on your cs2cs call will internally be translated to something like

+proj=pipeline
+step +inv +proj=utm +zone=55 +south +ellps=GRS80
+step +proj=hgridshift +grids=C:\dev\proj-datumgrid\oceania\GDA94_GDA2020_conformal.gsb
+step +proj=utm +zone=55 +south +ellps=GRS80

which in my opinion is a lot simpler to understand.

Hello, 

1) if you do not specify any datum you have so called "floating datum"
... meaning that it will be in what ever datum the library thinks is
most suitable for the situation. It will and should not assume any datum
if it is not given ... this is better behaviour (than assuming WGS84 as
it used to be, which created problems, jumps, and misunderstandings) 

2) see above (it used to be default ... but it was removed since it
created strange shifts (jumps)) -- for example large maps do not care
about datums since smallest details available (at one pixel scale) are
much larger than largest datum shifts anywhere used! 

Janne.
