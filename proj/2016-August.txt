Hi everyone,

It's been a year since the last Proj release, I wonder if it is a good 
time for another release?

Thanks,

-jeff

Yes, please. Although the SONAME bump will require a rebuild of all
reverse dependencies.

A new GeoTIFF release would be wonderful too, but somewhat offtopic for
this list.

Kind Regards,

Subject: [Proj] Failing to correctly configure, compile and run Proj locally
Message-ID: <22441.50869.132000.72657@woitok.gmail.com>

Greetings,

having recently cloned Proj from the Git repository at

   https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4.git

I want to configure, compile, and use it only locally in my home direct-
ory.  For that I run the commands:

   $ export PREFIX=$HOME PROD=proj
   $ cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo  \
           -D CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE=OFF         \
           -D CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON \
           -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="$PREFIX"   \
           -D CMAKE_LEGACY_CYGWIN_WIN32=0      \
           -D CONVERT_DATA=ON                  \
           -D DATADIR="$PREFIX/share/$PROD"    \
           -D DOCDIR="$PREFIX/doc/$PROD"       \
           -D INCLUDEDIR="$PREFIX/include"     \
           -D LIBDIR="$PREFIX/lib"             \
           -D MANDIR="$PREFIX/man"             \
           -D PROJ_BIN_SUBDIR=bin              \
           -D PROJ_DATA_SUBDIR="share/$PROD"   \
           -D PROJ_DOC_SUBDIR="doc/$PROD"      \
           -D PROJ_INCLUDE_SUBDIR=include      \
           -D PROJ_LIB_SUBDIR=lib              \
           -LAH ..
   $ cmake --build . --target all --target install

Apart from plenty of warnings regarding the redefinition of the constant
"M_TWOPI", the compilation succeeds.  However, the resulting "proj" bin-
ary refuses to run  as long as  environment variable "PROJ_LIB" does not
explicitly hold the path to "share/proj/":

$ env|grep PROJ
$ proj +init=epsg:32661
Rel. 4.9.3, dd Month yyyy
<proj>: 
projection initialization failure
cause: no system list, errno: 2

program abnormally terminated
$ export PROJ_LIB=$HOME/share/proj
$ proj +init=epsg:32661
^D
$

Is there a way to  configure Proj in such a way  that it's not necessary
to correctly set environment variable "PROJ_LIB" at runtime?

Any pointers welcome :-)

Sincerely,
  Rainer

Subject: [Proj] Question on +czech option
Message-ID: <5450336.1470872925769.JavaMail.wam@elwamui-hound.atl.sa.earthlink.net>


I am wondering if the parameter/option +czech is working correctly. 

If anyone is unfamiliar with it, this option is used with +proj=krovak, the Krovak projection used in former Czechoslovakia (and current Czech Republic). 

The 'native' Krovak has positive south, west axes (given in that order according to EPSG). Many Czech users are happy to use east, north axes in order to use various software packages that don't support multiple axis directions. 

Using an input point of latitude = 50, longitude = 20, I got these results (point is a little nonsensical due to using Ferro prime meridian in the tests):

with czech (2065)
cs2cs +to +proj=krovak +ellps=bessel +pm=ferro +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0.0
          +lon_0=42d30'E +lat_0=49d30'N +k_0=0.9999 +czech +no_defs

   cs2cs - PJ lib: 1589829.67     864777.51
   forward 2065  :  864777.51    1589829.67 (Esri projection engine)

without czech (5211)
cs2cs +to +proj=krovak +ellps=bessel +pm=ferro +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0.0
          +lon_0=42d30'E +lat_0=49d30'N +k_0=0.9999 +no_defs

   cs2cs - PJ lib: -1589829.67   -864777.51
   forward 5211  : -1589829.67   -864777.51 (Esri projection engine)

So without the +czech option, we get east, north axes. With +czech, we get values in west, south axes order, rather than south, west. Is this correct behavior?

Melita,

I did a bit of digging into history and :

* +czech was introduced in 2006 per 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/d3506b59ebf799225600bab48e697f8ed6a2c1e9
-->The patch indeeds negates values

It was contributed by Martin Landa and Radim Blazek, 
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2006-April/002209.html, whom I'm 
CC'ing if they can have some clues to share.

I guess that proj natively always expected the first value to be something 
"horizontal" regarding the projection plane and the second value to be 
"vertical", and that +czech was an attempt of getting closer to the "native" 
Krovak convention while staying close to proj convention. So it is probably 
essentially a matter of documenting what the +czech parameter does.

* There's another switch that can be used to control axis order in a cleaner 
and more general way, and was introduced later (2010) in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/3405bf76e70d12df6b9dc0c9c129c7dc96918e8d

Playing it with it shows interesting results :

* axis=swu (south, west, up)

echo "20 50" | cs2cs +to +proj=krovak +ellps=bessel +pm=ferro +x_0=0.0 
+y_0=0.0 +lon_0=42d30'E +lat_0=49d30'N +k_0=0.9999  +axis=swu +no_defs

864777.51	1589829.67 0.00

* or equivalently, but more convoluted, +czech +axis=neu ("northing", 
"easting" since +czech already negated values) :

echo "20 50" | cs2cs +to +proj=krovak +ellps=bessel +pm=ferro +x_0=0.0 
+y_0=0.0 +lon_0=42d30'E +lat_0=49d30'N +k_0=0.9999 +czech +axis=neu +no_defs

864777.51	1589829.67 0.00

The Original Krovak projection from 1922 has south-west axes, some years ago they changed to north-east.
So says the EPSG Guidance Note 7-1 (IOGP Publication 373-7-2 – Geomatics Guidance Note number 7, part 2) in the Krovak chapter.

All,

In keeping with our annual(ish) release cycle corresponding around FOSS4G time, I'd like to get the ball rolling on a 4.9.3 Proj.4 release. There are release notes to write, a number of PRs to decide on merging [1] and any last minute items to attack.

The automated tests are currently passing for master for both Linux [2] and Windows [3].

I will produce a 4.9.3RC1 this afternoon, and we'll go from there. Please consider this your call for issues, updates, or fixes. 

Howard

All,

I have prepared a proj.4 4.9.3 RC1. At the moment it is simply a release cut from master. We still need to do the following:

1) Upgrade to EPSG 8.9 db
2) Prepare release notes
3) In/out decisions on existing PRs [1]

You can download it at http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.3RC1.tar.gz and http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.3RC1.tar.gz.md5

Hi Howard,

Thanks for the release candidate.

May I also request that proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 [0] is promoted to final 
along with the last proj-4.9.3RC?

proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 has been included in the Debian package since 
proj-4.9.0RC2, but most distributions still use proj-datumgrid-1.5 with 
proj-4.9.x.

The "CTable2" format grid shift files are a very welcome change from the 
not architecture independent format used in proj-datumgrid-1.5 and earlier.

No issues have been reported with the proj-datumgrid-1.5 upgrade to 
proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 in the Debian package which has been available for 
some time now, and included in Ubuntu since wily. I don't think there 
are any blockers to promoting proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 to final.

Thanks for publishing an early RC.  I'll be happy to test future RCs,
e.g. another after db update and merging of various PRs.

I locally upgraded the pkgsrc package, and it built and passed the
included-with-proj tests on NetBSD 7 amd64.  Also postgis 2.2.2, when
built against the RC, passes its own tests.

I also built under pkgsrc on OS X 10.9 (and hence with clang) and that
tested ok.

Note that pkgsrc is still using the 1.5 grids, partly becuase we have a
policy of sticking to releases unless doing so is really broken, and
partly because I wasn't aware of the 1.6 RC.

There is a stray patch in the package:

src/bin_geodtest.cmake and src/geodtest.c need to be added to the
release.  (The cmake build expects them.)

Thanks Howard.  Builds fine with MSVC 2015, through nmake.  One note is 
that the extra "._" OSX files are included in this archive, which should 
be removed for the final release archive.

The OSX cruft is reported in: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/401

I've also excluded it from the repacked tarball for the Debian package.

We can promote it, but surely there have been updates since 2012? I unfortunately do not know how this was produced, and I don't know how to refresh it with current grid files. Frank's original message pointing to it from April 2012 is here [1].

I'm happy to simply promote it, but is there is value in bringing it forward to 1.7 and including any updated grids? It will probably be another year before we have a proj.4 release unless some critical thing shows up, so it would be best to knock these things out while there's attention.

All,

proj.4 4.9.3 RC2 is now available [1]. It includes removal of the OSX cruft (I'm now using an Ubuntu container to generate the release), the EPSG data was updated to 8.9 (no substantive changes), and the distribution additions that Charles mentioned. Release notes and existing Pull Request decisions are yet to be done.

Additionally, I created a Dockerfile [2] that describes the process I used to generate the EPSG database updates. It produces the data for libgeotiff, proj.4, GDAL, and PostGIS if access to the ESRI FileGDB SDK is available before building the container.  I will also use the same container for generating releases (based on Ubuntu Xenial) unless someone chimes in with a reason why we shouldn't use that.

proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 is already three years more recent than 1.5 that 
most distributions are still using, so that upgrade is already very welcome.

Hopefully Frank will be able to clarify the process to create the 
proj-datumgrid distributions, or someone will need to reverse engineer it.

I guess the process involves using nad2bin from proj >= 4.8 to convert 
the .lla source to the ctable2 output format.

For the content of the files you probably need the government 
organisations of the countries in question that provide the source data, 
as a Dutchman I'm not too familiar with those for US/Canada/France/New 
Zealand. For the latter two I investigated the origin of their 
respective .gsb files as part of the discussion with the Dutch Kadaster 
when they published their grid shift files for The Netherlands 
specifically for PROJ.4.

The French grid is derived from public data, see:

  http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2008-July/003590.html
  http://www.stjohnspoint.co.uk/gis/france.htm

The New Zealand data should be public too, and probably originates from:

  http://www.linz.govt.nz/data/geodetic-services/download-geodetic-software

Let's first make 1.6RC1 one final, before worrying about 1.7. It's worth 
investigating whether the data for the US has changed or if the .lla 
files from 1.5 were used to create the ctable2 format binary files in 
1.6RC1 (which I suspect is the case).

For the long term viability of proj-datumgrid getting a more formal 
release process is a good thing. That includes documenting where the 
data comes from and how to update it.

The number of countries supported by proj-datumgrid is very limited, for 
every other country users need to obtain the grid shift files themselves 
(although I've packaged the Dutch grid shift files for Debian), e.g. 
using the links from the Grids documentation page:

  http://proj4.org/grids.html

An argument could be made to just drop the proj-datumgrid distribution 
and leave it up to users to obtain the data files. But I suspect the 
effort involved getting the data was the reason to bundle them in 
proj-datumgrids to save others that pain.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Howard,

regarding the EPSG 8.9 upgrade, it seems from 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/b2d1648195d5a2e3ea07015a7a60ee7ee04337b9 
there was an issue with the regeneration of the proj 'epsg' file from the 
updated csv files pcs.csv, etc... with the new Kyrgyzstan SRS. 

For example there's the following line in 'epsg':
# Unknown
# Unable to translate coordinate system EPSG:7686 into PROJ.4 format.

But with GDAL updated:

$ gdalsrsinfo EPSG:7686

PROJ.4 : '+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs '

OGC WKT :
GEOGCS["Kyrg-06",
    DATUM["Kyrgyzstan_Geodetic_Datum_2006",
        SPHEROID["GRS 1980",6378137,298.257222101,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","7019"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","1160"]],
    PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
    UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","7686"]]

So the definition in 'epsg' should be '+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs '

I've actually manually run epsg_tr.py on gcs.csv and I do get the expected:
# Kyrg-06
<7686> +proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs  <>

So it seems that for some reason epsg_tr.py in your process found the 7686 
entry in gcs.csv but wasn't able to resolve it as WKT / ExportToProj4.


Same for

# Unknown
+# Unable to translate coordinate system EPSG:7692 into PROJ.4 format.

$ gdalsrsinfo EPSG:7692

PROJ.4 : '+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=68.51666666666667 +k=1 +x_0=1300000 
+y_0=14743.5 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs '

OGC WKT :
PROJCS["Kyrg-06 / zone 1",
    GEOGCS["Kyrg-06",
        DATUM["Kyrgyzstan_Geodetic_Datum_2006",
            SPHEROID["GRS 1980",6378137,298.257222101,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","7019"]],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","1160"]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
        UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433,
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","7686"]],
    PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
    PARAMETER["central_meridian",68.51666666666667],
    PARAMETER["scale_factor",1],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",1300000],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",14743.5],
    UNIT["metre",1,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],
    AXIS["Easting",EAST],
    AXIS["Northing",NORTH],
    AUTHORITY["EPSG","7692"]]


Regarding the libgeotiff update, the updated pcs.csv, gcs.csv, etc... files have 
not been committed into SVN.

Thanks for the catch, Even. I have updated the process generating the codes, and it is now behaving as expected. I pushed the update to the Proj.4 repository, and they will be included when we issue a new RC.

To issue the new RC, we need some feedback. I am inclined to merge the following pull requests. Please provide feedback about these items if you have some:

> #400 -- Times projection implementation -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/400
> MERGE
> 
> #399 -- Eliminate load time non-computable initializers in healpix -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/399
> MERGE by Kristian/Thomas
> 
> #386 -- GIGS tests -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/386
> MERGE
> 
> #366 -- Fix +wgs84 parameters for 3844 (Romania) -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/366
> MERGE


The following pull request require some more discussion:

> #391 -- new projection function for Navionics Mercator -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/391
> NOMERGE. There's some controversy about the usefulness and validity of the the projection in the ticket. Micah pointed out there is one other example of a pure single-use projection in proj.4, which this would seem to be. I'd like to hear some support by others about including this before merging it.
> 
> #388 -- Transformation pipelines -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/388
> Contingent on Thomas and Kristian being ready to merge it. It is new functionality so its impact should be minimal.
> 
> #383 -- Add BETA2007 grid and change potsdam datum -- https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/383

As implemented currently it is a manual override of epsg, so it will be lost 
at the next EPSG upgrade. A cleaner solution with the current infrastructure 
would be to add the appropriate override in 
https://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/geotiff/trunk/libgeotiff/csv/pcs.override.csv and 
resync GDAL, proj with it.

proj 4.9.3RC2 is compiling successfully on our build machines.  Thanks!

There was some discussion of normalizing whitespace a few weeks back and
it was agreed not to do any blanket conversions from tabs to spaces in
source code.

However, with 4.9.3RC2, I note that some other whitespace irregularities
have crept into the repository.  I recommend that these be corrected
before release.

   DOS line endings:
     src/PJ_eck5.c
     src/PJ_eck4.c
     src/PJ_goode.c
     src/PJ_eck1.c
     src/PJ_isea.c
     src/PJ_fahey.c
     src/PJ_hatano.c
     src/PJ_vandg4.c

   Internal ^M
     src/PJ_eck1.c

   Trailing whitespace
     man/man1/cs2cs.1
     src/pj_factors.c
     src/pj_gridinfo.c

   Spaces followed by tabs
     src/PJ_aitoff.c

   Extra newlines at end of file
     src/pj_list.c
     src/pj_list.h

Of these, the only really objectionable ones are the DOS line endings
and the internal ^Ms.

Now might also be a good time to eliminate all such irregularites at
least within the C source code.  I might add to this list of candidates
for fixing:

   No newline at end of file
   Internal tabs within a line

Charles,

I made a pass through the code to attempt to clean up the issues you've identified:

I didn't notice, but I concur that the line endings issues should be
fixed.  I think it would be just as well to fix the other issues too.

I've just returned from my holiday so unfortunately I haven't been able to pitch in before now. For now I'll just voice my opinion on the open PR's, but please let me know if there's anything else I can help with.

#386, #399 and #400 were merged a few hours ago so no need to discuss those.

#366: If I understand correctly, to fix this properly you would apply an override to the EPSG-database scripts somewhere in libgeotif or GDAL. I guess that hasn't happened yet, so +1 on merging. Can someone add the override where it belongs so we don't have to deal with this the next time there's updates to the EPSG file?

#383 (and #371): I have no insight in the technical side of things here, but I suggest we close #371 since it is basically the same as #383, and merge #383 when ready.

#388: As Thomas has already stated on github, it is not ready to be merged yet. 

#389: +1 on the NOMERGE. The discussion on github makes it clear to me that this is a projection that is made specifically for one particular older proprietary software package which is not in widespread use (so it seems to me at least). On top of that the documentation of the projection is not very good or publicly available (apart from a PDF attached to the github discussion). The submitter of the PR has not been able to explain what the benefits of merging his additions are, except for making it easier for the Navionics company to maintain their codebase.


Before releasing it would be nice to have the option of not compiling the newly implemented self-tests into proj. Even pointed out some time ago that the size of the proj binary becomes quite large when the tests are included. I will try to do something about that in the next few days.

Matteo,

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/391#issuecomment-241672732

I understand your frustration. Please know that the consensus seems to be to not include the Navionics projection for this release for a number of resolvable reasons:

1) It is a proprietary projection that appears to be single-use within the context of Proj.4's ecosystem. There is some question about its rigor and validity, but that is beside the point considering it is in use already.
2) It is unclear if there is a lot of public-readable data at rest in this coordinate system
3) It is unclear who is benefitting by its inclusion in Proj.4 beyond Navionics

The first one is for the Proj.4 project to consider. Do we allow single-use projections? Inclusion of a projection into the codebase assumes the project is responsible for maintaining it going forward. As Thomas and Kristian recently experienced, there are a lot of these if you have to touch them all. 

The second one is for Navionics to answer. Are there (or will there be) open source software for reading data in Navionics format(s) that makes open source support of its projection a significant convenience factor for users? 

The third is related to the second. Is the inclusion of this projection is simply to ease Navionics use of proj.4 and maintenance of its software stack? If so, it seems too special for inclusion. If it is to ease the transition of letting users' data out of proprietary formats and access to that data to the open source ecosystem, the case for its inclusion is stronger. The ticket traffic on this aspect is ambiguous. 

If there is some consensus after more discussion, it is still possible to include this projection into the codebase in a future release. We want to be careful about tossing proprietary projections over the wall into Proj.4 without clear external use cases and when they appear to be single-use in the context of Proj.4 and its ecosystem.

I've read the document on the Navionics projection.  (I've already
criticized this document for giving a false description of the Mercator
projection.)

It seems that this "projection" is a true forward projection (from
geographic to Mercator), but substitutes an approximation for the
reverse projection.

The motivation for the approximation is not clearly spelled out --
perhaps it's to save CPU time, or perhaps whoever formulated the
projection didn't know how to invert it.  However, nowadays, I would say
proj.4 should err on the side of providing accurate results -- in
particular it should normally aim to have the round-trip error close to
zero.

Introducing a new projection inevitably incurs some ongoing maintenance
burden and so should be only be accepted it is meets some real need.
This projection, being a crippled version of Mercator, doesn't make the
cut.

Message-ID: <784DE465-555C-41D5-81DF-7802A4BC832D@hobu.co>

Proj 4.9.3 RC3 is now available. The following updates were made since RC2:

- self-test is opt-in rather than opt-out (means smaller binaries by default) https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/405
- whitespace normalization https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/402
- healpix init https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/399
- Times projection implementation https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/400
- GIGS test update https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/386

Should no significant issues be found in the next few days, I will put forward this release to the MetaCRS committee for a release vote.

Compiles okay and tests pass for me on windows. Build both with nmake/visual studio and cmake/mingw. I'm not near a unix computer this week, but I am sure someone else will cover that.

RC3 also builds fine on all release architectures in Debian, see:

  https://buildd.debian.org/status/package.php?p=proj&suite=experimental

Earlier rebuilds of all reverse dependencies in Debian with RC1 [0] 
revealed that gpx2shp needed a patch to handle the renamed PI defines in 
projects.h, this was fixed quickly and the patch has been forwarded 
upstream:

  https://osdn.jp/ticket/browse.php?group_id=1425&tid=36561

[0] https://lists.debian.org/debian-gis/2016/08/msg00011.html

Kind Regards,

Bas

Message-ID: <AC4C6B03-4049-457E-B4A3-E80EA6F94905@hobu.co>

I motion to promote 4.9.3RC3 to final release.

The 4.9.3 release is mostly a bug fix release with a refresh of the EPSG database, and it corresponds to nearly a year of pull requests and patches. Periodic releases are critical to the long term health of projects such as Proj.4. Proj.4 is currently on an "annual" release cycle, usually corresponding on or near the FOSS4G conference, and we look to keep with that pace unless some critical issue is identified.

I'll start with +1.

Since I have not had any time left for testing, I will refrain from voting
(+0). This should not be considered as an indication of distrust - I am
fully confident that the testing carried out so far is as good as it gets
... so feel free to consider this as any fractional or integral value
between (and including) +0 and +1.
