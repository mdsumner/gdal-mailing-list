The almost Lambert Conformal Projection, +proj=lcca, source code,
test script and documentation are available at:

http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze2hc4d/proj4/

The procedure only services the truncated series form of LCC to
satisfy conversions of some French, North African and near Eastern
interests.  It has only been tested for the northern hemisphere but
if anyone knows of any usage in the southern hemisphere, let me
know.

Please DO NOT use this projection for new applications.  It is
only for handling existing usage.

Please let me know of any problems or have any suggestions.

Thank-you.

Is the non-Snyder Oblique/Equitorial (EPSG 9809) done yet?  I noted
some discussion in mid-Feb about it but have not heard of any
results.

If nobody is working on it I may as well give it a whack as
two projections in the last three weeks has me on a roll.

BTW, EPSG is somewhat sloppy in their math and elide a good
deal of information.  Secondly, to discuss and refer to their
work I wish they would use equation numbers.

Gerald,

I am incorporating the lcca into the remotesensing.org version of PROJ.4
but when I run the test script I don't get a close match to the EPSG values
you list.  Should I?

warmerda at gdal2200[60]% sh ~/lcca.tst
forward projection of:

34d08'11.291 37d31'17.625
15713.70        623182.75

inverse check of forward

34d08'11.29100"E        37d31'17.62500"N


If I run the first step of the test script with -V I get:

Very interesting.  The results at this end from the script are:

[gie at localhost src]$ ./lcca
forward projection of:

34d08'11.291 37d31'17.625
15707.96        623165.96
EPSG guide 7, pdf p. 22 gives values of: 15707.96 623165.96

34d08'11.29100"E        37d31'17.62500"N
[gie at localhost src]$

Ahhhhhh---I see it. PUT "no_defs" in the script. "Spec'd but
not used".   <<------------------------

I will correct the lcca.txt script.

Your local datum overrode the +b facor.  Look carefully at the
beginning of the -V output.

As you will note, my machine matches exactly to the cm.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] PROJ 4.4.6 Release
Message-ID: <3E642872.7020609@pobox.com>

Folks,

I have decided to kick out a PROJ 4.4.6 release.  A tentative attempt at this
is now available for download from the PROJ.4 page at:

   http://www.remotesensing.org/proj

The NEWS file reports:

4.4.6 Release Notes
-------------------

  o Incorporated new lcca (Lambert Conformal Conic Alternate) projection from
    Gerald.

  o Updated 'espg' translation file for EPSG 6.2.2 with better support for
    prime meridians.

  o Added Prime Meridians via +pm command switch to cs2cs (and pj_transform).

  o Fixed bug with 7 parameter transforms.

  o Added 'esri' pseudo-epsg coordinate system file.

  o Cleanup so that PROJ.4 compiles clean as C++ code.

  o Added pj_get_def() to expand definitions of stuff like +init clauses.

  o Added a Krovak implementation (proj=krov).  Note this may change again
    in the next release.

Although not noted, this release also attempts to work well on Cygwin, and
includes more recent versions of the automake, and libtool files.   If no
problems are encountered I will announce the release more widely on the
freegis mailing list, and freshmeat.net.

Best regards,

Gerald,

Of course you are right.  I get matching results to the cm with the
no_defs as well.

The lcca projection has been committed to CVS and is in the 4.4.6 release.

Gerald,

I don't believe anyone is working on it, and I for one would be very grateful
to have it added.

I have been trying to get through the math and have made little
progress, so if you want to take a whack at it, please do.

Hello Frank,
Thanks for the effort. I have being waiting for this update. I will now
continue my work on the Proj4 and the COM wrapper.

Again, thanks.

Unfortunately, the math presentation in the EPSG Guide 7 is a
horror story.  First, be sure to get the pdf version as my browser,
and I suspect others also, make a mess of the html math. 
I do use the Guide as a reference when dealing with other sources
and in trying to determine which "version" to use.  Unlike 
Snyder-like sources, many are not suitable for program development.
This is the reason I now make sure I have a LaTeX document file
that I work from when doing the coding.

I hope that the readers of my pdf files find the math clear,
complete and unambiguous---something from which you can code a
procedure.  I limit the math to the kernel of the projection
and omit all claptrap associated with cadestral usage such
as false eastings, etc.. This is taken care of by the outer
layer of proj.  Also, the kernel is written for the unit
sphere or ellipsoid (a=1) so it ends up that the only thing
of concern is the eccentricity factor.

Hi Frank,

I've recompiled the files for Borland C environment for the
4.4.6 version. The code is now synchron with yours to set the
path I've implemented a new source file call pj_init1.c it is
very short and contains our discussed code to set the nad search
path via the "setfinder" function. I've have to do so, because
you can't  set a function prototype through a DLL.

For the library I've to add only the function

PJ * pj_init_plus_path( const char *definition, const char *aDataPath )

to the proj_api.h and the proj.def file.

But I lost the feature to set the absolut path in the tools proj, nad 
etc. May be it is usefull for this tool to establish a path switch ?

Bye Alex

The new library is initial tested for the Booland C++wrapper class and 
the Delphi API. I' will send a mail if the files are downloadable.

Here the code for pj_init1.c

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frank,

Do you know the difference between the contents of the epsg file and the
esri file?  It seems to me that the esri file contains most if not all
of the epsg codes, plus about a dozen ESRI-specific codes.

Can you, or someone else confirm that the esri file is just an older
version of the epsg file to which these 12 ESRI-specific codes have been
added at the end?  If that's the case then should we update the esri
file in the distribution to be based on the latest epsg file?

Thanks

Daniel

Daniel,

I think it was the guys at Refractions who contributed the esri file.  I
thought it had more than 12 extra coordinate systems but I think that was
due to my not realizing that most of the ESRI coordinate system difference
were due to ESRI using a more recent epsg database than I used to.

I don't know how Refractions derived the 'esri' file ... it may have been
generated from the actual ESRI .prj files for each system in which case it
may differ in meaningful ways from the values derived directly from EPSG.

I am hesitant to change the esri file myself.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <1046804050.1200.98.camel@localhost.localdomain>

When and if I finish up the alternate Oblique Stereographic I
will probably also release a new version of the *pristine* PROJ.4.
The naming obviously needs some difference so I will call my
release: PROJ.4_e.x.y.  The e suffix has an obvious source.

I have to do it this way as I am uncompromisingly against some
of the material in libproj because it has *nothing* to do with
cartographic projections.  For example, datum and geocentric
related code.  Also, the new _e releases will be clear of geodesic
and nad2nad material.  I may release a replacement for geod
using Vincente's method---slightly more accurate.  But for
nad2nad, I am not in a position (also read: not interested)
to properly maintain the tables.

There are a couple of items in OSRS's release that could be
considered legitimate additions to PROJ.4. One of them is the
alternate meridian option.  This is mainly a matter of lazyness
in altering +lon_0 but lot's of things cater to the lazy although
is is nice to have a list of alternate prime meridians.  There
may be other added projection options I am unaware of that may be
useful so I would appreciate being reminded of them.

Another item is making sure the code will compile under C++.
My problem here is I am totally ignorant of C++ so when I once
tried to force gcc C++ with all warning-complaint flags on to
compile a PJ_*.c file I got a warning I am total in the dark about.
If these test compiles kick something up that is documented in
Harbison and Steele. I'll try and fix it.

Lastly, distribution will have the sources divided among sub-
directories as per my working environment.  Putting all the
C files in one directory is overwhelming.  The subdirectories
are support, conic, cylinder, azimuthal, etc..  Pretty obvious.

Respond with complaints, barbs and criticisms.

I'd like to give you an improved ESRI file, Frank which *only* includes 
codes used by ESRI. Note that ESRI included most (but not all) of the 
EPSG codes in their coding scheme. They also seem to have tried to avoid 
collisions. There were somem problems in the last file I gave you with 
Stateplane projections in feet.

Thanks for this Paul.  Unfortunately I think I didn't formulate my
question properly earlier today.  What I'm trying to do is come up with
is a epsg file that will contain all the regular epsg definitions and
all the esri-specific projections.  This is so that our WMS clients can
talk to ESRI WMS servers which advertize custom EPSG codes like
EPSG:102009.

Looking more closely at the file you sent I notice that there are a
bunch of definitions outside of the 0-32767 range.  Do you know if it
would be safe to assume that any definitions inside the 0-32767 range in
the esri file are a subset of the ones in the epsg file, so to produce
my merged file for my WMS client I could use the latest epsg file from
PROJ 4.4.6 and append to it all definitions from the esri file with ids
above 32767?

I guess I could walk through the file and find out myself, but if you
know the answer to that question already then that would save me some
time.  :)

Thanks 

Daniel

As I recall, there are ESRI numbers sprinkled around a bunch of places, 
not necessarily all outside the 32767 range. I made a superset file 
once, and can do it again if needed. Frank wanted the domains completely 
separate though.

Paul,

I think you diffed against the old epsg file.  The one in PROJ 4.4.6 includes
a bunch of these codes (eg 2000) which are in EPSG 6.2.2 but not in the EPSG
4.3 from which the last releases epsg file was derived.

In short, if that was an automated process you raw, perhaps you could run
it against the new file (from the release or CVS).

I think I make a statement earlier today that I was on a roll.
Well as of this evening the forward for the alternate
Oblique Stereographic checks with the EPSG bench mark.

After checking with the general description from EPSG and one
of Snyder's books, the projection looked like another variation
on the work I did on Krovak.  So being a good thief I copied
the Krovak over, replaced the conic with the spherical 
oblique stereographic from Snyder and ... .

I think there might be a general routine here, like the oblique
stuff in libproj that will do the conformal sphere transform and
then call the spherical projection of your choice.  Hey, you folks
can cook up a bunch of new projections and give them names of
your choice.

Time to pull the switch and get ready for the "Daily Show."

That mathematical routine only applies to the Oblique Stereographic Double
(per the Canadian Maritime Provinces, such as Prince Edward Island).  I
believe the French Navy Roussilhe Oblique Stereographic is different, and I
know the Bulgarian Hristow Oblique Stereographic is quite different.  A
particular truncation of the Hristow is used for the "Romanian Stereo 70."
Others exist.

See "Zeitschriff fur Vermessungswessen," circa 1930s-1940s.

In regard to the "new" projections, the "double" technique with the
Gaussian (conformal) Sphere is about 100 years old ...

Like I said, there's are an infinite set of conformal solutions for
any basic type.  The request here was to solve the EPSG spec and that
one only.  As for Roussilhe and others, we'll cross those creeks when
we get there.  At least I have source equations for Roussilhe.

Point me to source material on the Bulgarian/Romanian projections and
I'll be glad to consider them.  So far none of my material even
whispers those names.  BTW: Hristow is Germanization of V.K. Khristov
a Bulgarian geodesist. (from Snyder).  Romania remains the home
of the equally mysterious Transylvanian Alps.

Of course, the Gauss transformation is aged.  What is amazing to me
is that outside of brief mention of it, its application is *not* well
discussed in any of the well known cartographic projection books.
Oft criticized Pearson was the only source of basic info on this
method and even his was not complete.

If the EPSG people would do just a modicum of work on these
projections they would recognize the similarities between Krovak
and the stereographic and thus make documentation similar.  As it
stands now, Guide 7 again presents a muddled set of equations
probably stripped from some obscure bureaucratic memorandum written
by someone reinventing the wheel.  I'm at least trying to put
some shiny hub caps on the wheels.

OK, List, what about it.  The main thing that spurred me on was that
proj wouldn't set an arbitrary limit of 6 characters, e.g. I live in
PL04KE, when outputting, like so many programs do, e.g. qgrid (which
is up for adoption) on debian.

Naturally, I don't have any burning need in mind, other than adding
another method to make sure the Martians can find me to

I would argue strongly against adding Maidenhead references to PROJ: it
really is apples and oranges. PROJ takes, as input and output, pairs
of real numbers: lat/long and x/y. The Maidenhead system encodes lat/long
into a (limited-precision) alphanumeric string, referring to a region,
not a point (the precision is extensible, I admit). There are very many
such regionalizations: Marsden squares, Flinn-Engdahl regions, the Military
Grid Reference System [based on UTM], the new US National Grid Reference
system, and on and on.

This is not to deny the value of having such routines, but they should
be kept separate from the proj and cs2cs routines, since their output is
a different kind of thing (and not invertible).

Hello Gerald,
Thanks for the updates and the great work.
I have just visited your site for the first time.

I must say that I am personally not impressed by your "Basic Concern"
section. You have expressed your views on this forum, but making it
a public compaign message seems a bit out of the way.

Frank could have renamed the library, in which case the original version
will continue to exist. In fact, there is no reason why you should not
maintain the original version and distribute it for anyone interested.

You or the Proj4 project may have some target, but Frank definitely also
have
some target like anyone here.
Modifications to satisfy the target is a natural thing and we should all
respect it.
If current Proj4 does not meet my target, I think I will fork it to get what
I needed.

I personally respect and admire you a lot for the great work done,
but reading the stuff there was not encouraging at all.
Please consider getting ride of it - this is my personal view.

Best regards,
Paul.

First, I do not consider the my web site very public as this mail
group is the only place it has be advertised.  I don't think Google
has picked it up yet.

I probably should rehack the comments on the index page as they are
not quite as clear as I would like.  My major concern is the lack
of structure of the software data base and the misconception that
cartographic projections, geodesy and datum applications are all
one item.

I would dearly like to see a good site for public distribution
of detailed information on cartographic projections; both
descriptive and computational.  I can understand and be equally
sympathetic to this attitude on the subject of geodesy and datums.
Again, and I can't emphasize this enough, the subject areas need
to be kept in their own pigeon holes so that the user need not be
confronted with a mass of unrelated information in his/her retrieval.

If proj4 does not satisfy your needs, then perhaps you are looking
in the wrong place.  If the need is not projection related then
why look in a projection library.  For example, translation of
geographic coordinates to geocentric x-y-z coordinates is not a
projection so why look in a projection library?

Lastly, I cannot run a proj.4 source by myself because of a lack of
resources.  Most importantly, I need a collection of critics who will
look at and use the material and subject it to critical tests for
accuracy and readability.  Secondly, being retired I do not have
a library card to get at potential sources.  Even if I did, it is
over 60 miles to Boston and would cost over $25US per trip---
public transportation or private car to say nothing of lost personal
time.  And even then a trip up there is not likely to yield an obscure
paper from the Czech Republic.

Going back to the web site and the editorial comments.  Remove it?
Change it?  I dunno.  It is still an issue I have not heard a
clear response to.

I don't think so. The epsg file gives all the definitions of ids within 
the epsg domain. The esri file gives all the definitions of ids within 
the esri domain.  The fact that the esri and epsg domains overlap does 
not make the individual domains any less distinct.

The ugrly compromise would be to just pretend the esri domain does not 
exist at all and dump their spare ids into the epsg file. Also dump all 
the half-assed temporary ids in there too, like the canadian lambert 
and the bc albers ids.  The way it would be one stop shopping, no line, 
no waiting.

I know it's bad in theory to do so, but we do distribute those flavours
of combined files on our download site for those who want their
MapServer-based WMS clients to talk to other canadian WMS servers, or to
ESRI WMS servers.  

If anyone needs them, the following files can be used as replacements
for the default 'epsg' file:

Base EPSG + a few custom canadian codes (42101, 42304, ...):
http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/mapserver/dl/proj4-epsg-with-42xxx.zip

Same as above plus the list of ESRI codes that you sent earlier:
http://www2.dmsolutions.ca/mapserver/dl/proj4-epsg-with-42xxx-and-esri.zip

Note that we do not want to encourage use of those canadian and ESRI
EPSG codes in WMS servers, we just provide them to allow WMS clients to
talk to servers that use those codes.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] PROJ tasks and routines
Message-ID: <200303071508.HAA06429@bilby.ucsd.edu>


Prompted by some recent comments, especially those by Gerald Evenden,
I'd like to offer one view of what PROJ does, and how those functions
might be embodied in software--recognizing that what may be easiest to use,
is not always easiest to learn. I hope this will provoke reactions, and
perhaps some ideas that can be used in any future documentation (the ones
here are available for use, if anyone likes them).

	First, definitions: PROJ is the package, proj and cs2cs are
the routines in it.

I would say that there are three different, though related, activities
covered by PROJ:

A. Projections

	This looks like:

                      ______________________
	             |                      |
	lat/long <===|  projection routine  |====> x/y
	             |______________________|

where the box can go either way. What is inside the box is software 
implementing a set of equations: the important point is that these are
nothing but mathematics, 99% devoid of empirical content about the Earth
(the 1% is that the 1/flattening is << 1).

B. Grids

	This looks like:

                      ______________________
	             |                      |
	lat/long <===|  projection routine  |====> x/y
	             |______________________|

where what is inside the box is software implementing a set of equations. If
this sounds a lot like (A), that is because it is, and with the same
equations (almost always). But there is a crucial difference, which Cliff
Mugnier has pointed out on a number of occasions: the parameters in
these equations (and sometimes the equations themselves) are set "by
definition" either by a government or a commercial firm. There is a
bit more empirical information here (specifically, ellipsoid parameters),
but mostly a lot of semi-arbitrary constants.

(And, there is also the difference that in (A) the x/y are usually in units
to be plotted (eventually), in (B) the x/y is, by design, close to actual
distance on the ellipsoid).

What is also set by legal definition is the *kind* of lat/long that
is legitimate to feed into the box: that is, the datum. This leads to
confusion with the next item:


C. Datums

	This looks like:

                      ________________________________
	             |                                |
	lat/long <===|  datum-transformation routine  |====> lat/long
	             |________________________________|

where now the software implements a quite different set of equations--in most
cases pretty simple ones (a rotation and translation, aka "7-parameter
Helmert") but occasionally more complicated (NAD27 <=> NAD83).  But the
parameters used are *very* empirical: somebody had to go out and make
measurements for each datum transformation, though once these measurements
are made it may also be the case that certain datum transformations are
taken as being defined. In thinking about the amount of empirical information
involved, it might help to realize that the parameters for
a datum transformation can be wrong, while a grid or projection can't
be: they are what they are. I happen to live in a place where the
datum transformations become wrong over time, because of plate tectonics.
(Of course the implementation of a grid can be wrong, but not the definition).

	Because grid definitions include a statement that the lat/long
should be "XXX Datum" I think there is a tendency to mix up (B) and (C),
and hence (A) (B) and (C), even though (C) is quite different from (A) and
(B). I think this tendency has influenced the evolution of the package--and
it has to be said that being able to do (B) and (C) fills a real need not
covered by other free projection software (eg, the Generic Mapping Tools).

	It would keep these distinctions cleaner if proj (the routine)
did (A) [and hence (B), depending on the parameters set] while there
was a program called (say) datumtr for doing (C): then one could use
pipes to get any transformations needed: eg, SPCS on NAD27 to SPCS on NAD83
would be (schematically)

    cat SPCS27 | proj -inverse | datumtr -NAD27to83 | proj -forward > SPCS83

What has happened instead is the cs2cs has combined both (B) and (C); certainly
having both is valuable, and I appreciate that what has been done is done,
but I would urge that whatever is done to cs2cs to allow it specifically
to perform the combined (B) and (C), not be added to proj, which is thus
left simpler for the people who just want to do (A). Mission creep can be
insidious.

	I would also argue that proj should continue to implement only
lat/long <==> x/y, leaving the various 3-d transformations out.
Since cs2cs handles triples, this could go there--but really, it might
be better to make this a separate routine, since it is a function of 3
variables rather than 2. Again, it's a choice between ease of use and
separate routines for separate activities. (I'd also note that the
XYZ-to-ellipsoid transform, done accurately over a wide range of ellipsoid
heights, is something that has attracted a lot of attention in the geodetic
literature recently, so some thought would be needed about the appropriate
algorithm).

	Hope this seems right, or at least worth discussing, to others.

Duncan,

My view has been to reserve the commandline program "proj", and the pj_fwd()
and pj_inv() functions for the task of doing "projections".

The cs2cs and pj_transform() function are conceived of as more general
"coordinate system to coordinate system" converters including datum shifts
and potentially more esoteric stuff.

Within the API there is some "mess" in that the PJ structure, and pj_init()
are used for both sets of functionality.  The PJ structure carries around
a bunch of stuff that is related to datums even when only the projections
capabilities are being used.

In my ideal world the source code of the PROJ tree would be segregated in
such a way that Gerald could work off the same source tree as me, but releasing
a pure PROJ.4 from the traditional subset of code related to projection without
all the datum, and "geod" cruft that goes beyond it.  I would add all the
datum code, and other cruft to produce a "CS-PROJ" (CoordinateSystems-PROJ)
release corresponding to me current PROJ releases.  I do still believe that
many applications and end users want to view things at the coordinate systems
level and that a unified api for that is valuable.

In any event, I would like to stress that I am very pleased to have Gerald
back writing projections code and I hope we can work out a close cooperative
agreement.  Not to fret folks, life is good.

Best regards,

Hello Duncan,
Thanks for the summary. It is very informative, just took a print and
will add it to my Proj4 file :-)

To the best of my knowledge, I am caught up on OSRS's *projection*
needs.  If not, please queue up your requests.

In the mean time, I am working on few problems here: 1) review figure
generation using GNUplot, 2) finishing documentation on a couple of
minor projections and 3) considerations on general documentation.

Hello Gerald,
Thanks for the commitment to the development of the Proj4.
Were the original figures generated with GNUPlot?

On the documentation, someone here started a similar effort,
do not know the state though. You might wish to contact him
for a discussion.

Best regards,
Paul.

The original figures in the pdf distributions came from two
sources: MAPGEN and PLOTGEN and my device independent plotting
routine.  I have dropped doing anything with both projects as
they are pretty much out of date and I don't know anyone using
them.  Since gnuplot has been around a while and I figure I might
as well use it in any new effort.

Mike Schmidt has started on redoing the documentation but
the last I checked he had been stalled with other duties.
At the moment, my concerns are documenting new material
and not duplicating anything he does although I am interested
in getting the illustrations up to date.

Hmmm...never heard of MAPGEN and PLOTGEN, have used GNUPlot a
lot in the past.
I hope you will do the plotting routine in C to make it portable to other
platforms too :-)

Yes, he is the one I was refering to. He had some initial problems with
the format, do not know if he is able to resolve it.
I was suggesting LaTeX, since it can be compiled to DVI, PDF, PS etc.

What is the format of the original documentations (before converted to
the pdf)? Can this be released to the public?

Best regards,
Paul.

I'm too old to use C++ and not old enough to have a second childhood
with FORTRAN, so I do everything is in C.  As for the routines that
do the figure plotting, they are what I call "ad hoc programs."
Something that stays in my desk drawer and is definitely unsuitable
for underage viewing.  This is a family news group.

The man files were necessarily in [r|t]roff but all other documentation
is in LaTeX.

As for their release...Mike knows it was like pulling teeth to
get them out of me.  The whole setup is very chaotic and not
suitable for public distribution.

I can hardly imagine using gnuplot to draw maps.  You could, but it
would be pretty painful -- gnuplot is a tool for plotting/graphing
tabular data.  It's not a general-purpose plotting tool.

I won't argue.

But tell me of an alternative with a GNU license or equivalence.

I'm just trying to use what's available in the Linux environment.

But the bottom line is this: it replicates the ps files that
are in the PROJ.4 pdfs and the ps files are only about 70% larger
that the ps files generated by my old 'plotter' program.  Gnuplot
has a lot more flexibility than 'plotter'.

Good question.  I don't really know of any, though I don't do much with
PostScript.

Fascinating.  I would have expected gnuplot to do a crude and cumbersome
job at best.  Would you mind sharing the commands you're using (and a
bit of sample data) so this old dog can learn some new tricks?  Thanks!

The following is the bash script I use to generate most of the
pseudo cylindrical illustrations.  The last bit is the control
string for 'gnuplot'.  Procedure coast reads world coast line data,
passes it through a call to the PJ library and transfers the
resultant xy vectors to the scratch file.  Procedure graticule
generates a graticule of constant lat-lon lines, passes ll data
though a call to PJ lib and concatinates the xy output to the
scratch file.  Finally, the scratch file is passed to gnuplot which
outputs an eps.

Execute as:
  proto eck4
First arg is projection name. A second arg contains any added
+operation details.  None In this case.

Process is pretty speedy:

[gie at localhost figs]$ time ./proto times
+proj=times

real    0m0.390s
user    0m0.156s
sys     0m0.018s

# prototype for generating illustration
BASE=/home/gie/MAPGEN
BIN=PROJ.4/graphics
COAST=$BASE
proj="+proj=$1 $2"
echo $proj
coastarg=.3,-180,180,-90,90
gratarg=.001,15,,-180,180,90,-90,90

$BASE/$BIN/graticule $gratarg $proj +R=1 >data.dat
echo -e "\n" >>data.dat
zcat $COAST/world | \
$BASE/$BIN/coast $coastarg $proj +R=1 >>data.dat
gnuplot <<EOF
set output "$1.eps"
set terminal postscript eps
set data style lines
set bmargin 0
set rmargin 0
set tmargin 0
set lmargin 0
set nolabel
set noxtics
set noytics
set nokey
set noborder
plot 'data.dat'
EOF

The main reason that gnuplot files are longer than 'plotter'
output is each output vector element in gnuplot looks like

-36 224 V
-25 215 V
-18 416 V

whereas plotter would generate something like:

-36 224 -25 215 -18 416 V

That is, a long string of delta pairs before doing a plot command.
Gnuplot also has an overhead of spec'ing characters in the
preample that plotter did not but that is only a 1 or 2k
overhead.

<blank>V per line takes a lot of bytes.

Gnuplot is fairly sophisticated, this job is pretty crude and
does not exercise the program.  I'm mostly turning off options.

Paul,

Do correctly understand then that each named datum in the datumtransform
table will have a *default* transformation to use with the datum, but that
by explicitly including the transformation in the PROJ_INFO file it is
intended to be easy for users to alter what transformation values are used?

Right.  I would add that there is a pj_get_def() function in PROJ.4 which can
be used to get an "expanded" definition of a PROJ.4 coordinate system string.
For instance, it will expand a +datum= into the actual transformation values
that would be used with it.  This is intended to be useful for applications
that want to find out the magic in certain coordinate system definitions.
This also could be used to fetch back details from lookups from the various
"cookbook" coordinate system files, like the state plane ones, and the EPSG
database.

I meant that an import program like r.in.gdal should be able to associate
particular datum shift transformation information with the dataset.  That is
if it knows that a non-default datum shift should be used it could populate
the PROJ_INFO file with it.  This would seem to be very easy with your
approach.

I don't see the prime meridian as an attribute of the datum, though it is
an attribute of a geographic coordinate system based on the datum.  That is,
I think the prime meridian handling is orthagonal to the datum shift info.

I agree that some degree of categorization of coordinate system definitions
would be desirable.  In many systems I have looked at there is really just
one level of categorization, but each pre-defined coordinate system can be
part of more than one group.  So the groups might include:

   Common
   NAD27 State Plane
   NAD83 State Plane
   European
   North American
   EPSG Projected Coordinate Systems
   EPSG Geographic Coordinate Systems

and so on.

Some coordinate systems might appear in several groupings.  If something like
this is built, I would ideally like to see it implemented within PROJ.4, so
that other systems could easily take advantage of it.  If done within PROJ.4,
one approach would be to use each "initialization" file as a group, and add
a mechanism to supply some of the auxilary information with each coordinate
system.  The existing EPSG, and state plane files would be a good start.

I am cc:ing this to the PROJ.4 list for possible additional comment.

Folks,

I am working on implementation of NTv2 support, and as part of that effort
I am trying to add a small test script for the existing datum support ... try
to make sure I don't break anything while improving things.

In doing so, I have started looking at the files for datum shifting and
realized I am confused about them.

The files conus.lla, alaska.lla, hawaii.lla, prvi.lla, stgeorge.lla,
stlrnc.lla, and stpaul.lla are all apparently files with grid shifts from
NAD27 to NAD83, right?

The files FL.lla, MD.lla, TN.lla, WI.lla and WD.lla are listed in the
README as being for "high precision conversion of geographic coordinates
from NAD83 to NAD83".  What does that mean?  I presume this relates to
HPGN, which I gather is a higher precision form of NAD83, is that right?
Do these files shift from "old NAD83" to "HPGN NAD83" or the other way?

Frank,

You are correct regarding the HARN interpolation files.  They may be used
to go in either direction with the original NAD83.  Note that NTv2 has a
variable mesh grid because of the great expanses of Canada that had zero
control points.  NADCON on the other hand, has a constant mesh grid.  I
have not compared the bi-linear interpolation code between NADCON and NTv2,
so I don't know if "one size fits all."

I would guess that one can convert in either direction for Canada also.

Yes, the conus, Alaska, Hawaii, prvi, stgeorge, stlrnc, and stpaul files
make up the NAD27 grid shift set; as far as I'm aware they are the only
files used for NAD27 definitions in PROJ.  The HARN files are used in
bidirectional conversions in NAD83.

Message-ID: <14839805.1047624788422.JavaMail.root@homer.codemagi.com>

Hello, I'm running into a problem with proj-4.4.6 not finding the epsg file. I am using proj4 with MapServer 3.6.4 on RedHat8.0, and compiled proj4 (using gcc 3.2) first with default option, and then MapServer (using gcc 2.95). From what I've read, everything is located where it should be, so I'm wondering what I missed.

The error is produced by using the term "init=espg:102003" in a MapServer projection layer. This epsg code corresponds to Albers NAD83 in the epsg file. Output to browser is "msProcessProjection(): Projection library error. no system list, errno: 2"

MapServer says it recognizes proj4: 

# cgi-bin/mapserv -v
MapServer version 3.6.4 OUTPUT=PNG OUTPUT=JPEG OUTPUT=WBMP SUPPORTS=PROJ SUPPORTS=TTF SUPPORTS=WMS_SERVER INPUT=TIFF INPUT=EPPL7 INPUT=JPEG INPUT=POSTGIS INPUT=GDAL INPUT=SHAPEFILE

system knows proj:

# which proj
/usr/local/bin/proj
# /usr/local/bin/proj -v
Rel. 4.4.6, 3 March 2003
<proj>: 
projection initialization failure
cause: no arguments in initialization list
program abnormally terminated

nad dir exists where supposed to:

# ls /usr/local/share/proj/
epsg  GL27   nad83    pj_out27.dist  proj_def.dat  test83
esri  nad27  nad.lst  pj_out83.dist  test27        world

Perhaps permissions? all owned by root, 644. Hmmmm, what else. No mention of epsg in config.log

Thanks for the help, hope this sparks some recognition for someone...

Hi,

I would suggest:

  o trying to see if "proj -V +init=epsg:102003" works properly.
  o Does you mapserver running under apache have read permissions
    down into /usr/local/share/proj?
  o set the PROJ_DEBUG environment variable and see what it reports
    about opening supporting files.  (just set it to anything).
  o Set the PROJ_LIB environment variable to /usr/local/share/proj

I think the mostly likely problem is not having read permission to
the file for the user under which your mapserver runs.

Good luck,

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] projection precision
Message-ID: <1047660691.1812.35.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Because there was a discussion about projection precision
related to the truncated conformal conic I wanted to know what
the reaction would be to increased projection precision in general.

Case in point: the routine to compute the distance along a
meridian to a specified latitude has always be "truncated"
and limited in precision.  Original GCTP wasn't much better
than a few millimeters and later PROJ has a 1x10^-5 meter
version.  In my closet for a number of years is a 1x10^-9
meter version (limit of Intel 64 bit double).  Now I have
an adaptable precision version good for any size double.

"Get to the point Evenden."

Ok, what is going to be the
reaction if a new release of UTM produced different numbers
in the sub-millimeter range than the previous versions?
Is this going to cause panic?

For the moment, initialization, forward and inverse calls
are the same as the old pj_enfn, pj_mlfn and pj_inv_mlfn
except that the returned double pointer of pj_enfn is now
a void structure pointer.

Note: the dumb names are carry overs from GCTP.

Alex,

Cool!  Have you announced this effort on the freegis list?  I think it would
be a good idea.

Of course you are welcome to use shapelib and PROJ.

I would like to encourage you to build on GDAL and OGR for raster and
vector format access.  Of course use of GDAL and OGR might be against your
lean and mean motto, but it would give you a bunch of capabilities in short
order rather than tying to a bunch of ideosyncratic C libraries for different
formats.

OGR also contains a higher level coordinate system abstraction built on PROJ.4.

Folks,

I have preliminary support for Canadian NTv2 grid shift files incorporated
into PROJ.4 with some major flaws still (it does not pick the most refined
grid).  This is the same .gsb format used by some other organizations,
notably in Australia.

I write this to warn people that the structural changes in PROJ.4 (in the
datum shifting area) were substantial and are not really quite complete
so take care using PROJ.4 from CVS for a week or so.

Hello Frank,
Since Proj4 is a working code being used in many applications,
I think it will be better to commit only working codes.

Not everyone will read this, and some may even join the list
later. In fact, you do not have to join the list to use the Proj4 :((

Best regards,
Paul.

Thanks for the debug tips Frank -- it does appear to be a permissions problem since passing the epsg code from the command line works just fine. I neglected to mention that my MapServer is being invoked by an Apache virtual host -- still some tweaking to do.

Hello, I'm seeing the following error in my Apache error log after setting PROJ_DEBUG. This from MapServer 3.4.6 on RedHat 8.0 with proj-4.4.6...

[Tue Mar 18 15:06:44 2003] [error] [client 63.204.130.104] pj_open_lib(proj_def.dat): call fopen(/usr/local/share/proj/proj_def.dat).

I was expecting a permissions error on the file, but this looks as if pj_open_lib() is producing an error from unsucessfully calling fopen(). The path and file are correct, so my next step was going to be examining PHP version details.

thanks much!

Leah,

When PROJ_DEBUG is defined, libproj produces a variety of output to stderr,
but that isn't meant to imply an actual error has occured.  With the current
code (in CVS) the word "failed" or "succeeded" comes after the above message.
Perhaps it doesn't do that in 4.4.6?  I am surprised.

Note that the normal problem people encounter is that the "nobody" user
doesn't have read access on /usr/local/share/proj/* for some reason.

Best regards,

No, I haven't seen any output of "failed" or "succeeded" in my log. When I use "init=espg:2163" in my projection, Apache logs an error and MapServer outputs to browser the projection library error; using "proj=aea" I only see the error in the Apache log.

I've done quite a bit of tinkering with the access, such as setting all permissions on for /usr/local/share/proj, changing Apache user to one with broad privileges, setting PROJ_LIB to a distinct directory owned by Apache user, testing /usr/local/bin/proj_def.dat as an option...etc. Nothing seems to make a difference. But to safely eliminate access to system libs as a problem, it seems unlikely that I could run proj from the command line if it couldn't access stdio.h. So, back to the access investigation...

(ignore mention of PHP earlier, just me getting my fopen() confused.)

Leah - Have you tried adding the proj library directory to

Yup, no luck there either. Another possibility I am considering is my MapServer build.

My immediate workaround has been to run my latlong data as a batch file through proj (works like a charm) and just update my database accordingly. So, no projection on the fly for the time being, but I'll build MapServer again once I confirm that it's playing nice with other components.

Sverre,

I think you likely haven't included the datum shift files before
building and installing.  There is more info on this near the top of
the FAQ:

Hello GMT and PROJ.4 users:

Thank you for help and comments.

I need to convert the coordinates on a Spherical earth
(GMT ELLIPSOID: "Sphere", 1980, 6371008.7714, 6371008.7714, 0.0)
(e.g. Sandwell/Smith v.9.1 gravity data) to WGS84, but I
have problems finding the right transformation parameters.

* I have installed the USGS software PROJ.4 from
   http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/
   Program cs2cs supports tranformations between
   different datums if you have the right paramters (towgs84)

* A comprehensive list of "towgs84" paramters is found
   on http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/doc36/proj.html
   However, not Sphere to WGS84 can not be fond on this site
   or other places I have looked on the internet.

Question:
Can anybody supply me with the right towgs84 paramters for
a translation from Sphere to WGS84?

Sverre,

The solution to your problem is essentially an exercise in algebra.  There
is little practical value (that I can think of) for geodetic applications
in this case, but "cartographic license" can be always be invoked with a
bit of tongue-in-cheek ...

I suggest that you use the conversion from "geocentric latitude" to
"geodetic latitude" with whatever ellipsoid you choose.  There is no need
to "play" with the longitude values you have since the ellipsoid is a solid
of revolution and therefore already is a "spherical" function.

Sverre,

First, you are talking about converting from spherical coordinates.
In this case there is no real "datum" in effect, so you are just
converting fro spherical coodinates to ellpisoidal coordiantes on the
target ellipsoid (WGS84).  Currently PROJ only supports this sort of
transformation if you fake it into thinking you know the datum shift
required, but you can safely give a 0,0,0 shift.   I would do this like
this:

% cs2cs -v +proj=latlong +a=6371008.7714 +b=6371008.7714 +towgs84=0,0,0 +no_defs \
        +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 << EOF
? -114 44
? 0 0
? 0 90
? EOF
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +a=6371008.7714 +b=6371008.7714 +towgs84=0,0,0 +no_defs
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0
114dW   44d11'32.033"N 3217.845
0dE     0dN -7128.229
0dE     90dN 14256.457

While I have specified your particular spherical size, it doesn't really
matter if you only want 2D coordinates.   In this case it suggests that
converting from (114W, 44N) on your sphere would put you at (114W,44d11'32"N)
but 3218m below the surface of the sphere.  I have also converted an
equatoral and pole location to show the extreme effects on elevation at
those locations.

I would also add that the +no_defs on the spherical coordinate system
is very important in this case, otherwise somehow the +ellps=WGS84 default
from proj_def.dat will override the +b setting.

Best regards,

Sverre:

	You do not need PROJ. The Sandwell-Smith gravity data are on a
Mercator grid, the Mercator projection being for a spherical Earth. If
you use the program img2xyz that comes with the grid it will convert the
x-y grid coordinates back to geographical lat and long--not, despite
the name, to spherical XYZ (perhaps the source of confusion). So there
is no need to transform to any other latitude.

	As far as datums go, this is all marine data, so the sources for the
positions are:

	1. Satellite radar-ranging to the sea surface: this will be on a DoD
global datum (different ones at different times), the same as WGS84 to the 
relevant precision.

	2. Shipboard gravity:
		A) Celestial navigation: astronomical lat and long
		B) Satellite naviagation: same as (1)
		C) Loran--may use a regional datum
	Most of the high-seas data will be (B).

Since the grid is averaged to 1-minute spacing, none of the differences
matter anyway.

I finally have scrounged enough info from the net that pretty
well verifies that the projection known on the PROJ system
as somerc will do the CH1903 and CH1903+ grid systems. It also
appears that this projection was originally done by Rosenmund
with inferences that it may be what is called the "Rosenmund
Projection."

This latter interpretation is still not verified.  The projection
uses our old friend from the Krovak and alternate stereographic:
conformal projection to the sphere now known as pj_gauss in the
modern libproj library.

Jesus,

Proj4 has a far more comprehensive suite of projection formulae, and also
utilizes the EPSG database.  Although there are numerous errata in that
EPSG database, GeoTrans ONLY supports the current U.S. Dept. of Defense
unclassified data for local datums to WGS84 datum.

Anything I say here is going to be interpreted as being catty but
I can't help it.  Also it is only from a projection standpoint
and with no concern for datums.  Also, it is a programmer's view.

I dragged down a copy of Geotrans to take a look at it.

1) it looks like it was written by a COBOL instructor. VERY
	verbose and full of VERY long identifiers.
	For the Mercator projection Geotrans took 373 lines while
	PJ_merc.c takes 80.
2) coding is not written by a math programmer
	For example: has no idea about nested polynomials among
	other things.
3) on plus side there is a transverse equal area cylindrical
	for the ellipse that I have not heard of.
	But I have not heard of anyone who needs one either.
4) not very many projections
5) usage from a programmers stand point is messy and complex
	with far too many globals.  Very difficult to read.

I would translate the teac into libproj but I don't know if I
can figure out the code.  As I say, it is VERY unreadable and
that is from someone used to writing inscrutable code.

>From a user's view it may be OK but from my viewpoint I would
only rate it 1.5 stars out of 5.

Anyway, meow.

A followup note: reading the Mercator code realized the fact that
although you could spec the scale factor at the equator
(equivalent to +k_0=) there was no latitude of true scale
(+lat_ts=) that, from my experience, is the most common usage
for Mercator (look at the bottom of navigation charts).

Hello Gerald,
I found your comments on the codes very interesting.
I am particularly interested in the first one...

> 1) it looks like it was written by a COBOL instructor. VERY
> verbose and full of VERY long identifiers.

I do not know if there is any rule on identifiers but using readable
identifiers is quite useful in open sources, especially where documentation
is minimum.
On the other hand, the single and double letter identifiers in the Proj.4
makes it very cryptic.

I do not think many will have problem with method names like

  void Get_Mercator_Parameters(double *a,
                               double *b,
                               double *Origin_Latitude,
                               double *Central_Meridian,
                               double *False_Easting,
                               double *False_Northing,
                               double *Scale_Factor);

as found in the GeoTrans codes.

My copies of both libraries read GeoTrans: 380 vrs Proj4: 148, with
more than half of the 380 lines being COMMENTS which is hardly found
in the Proj4 files.
Typically, you find the comment for the above method as:

/*

 * parameters, Mercator projection parameters, and scale factor.
 *
 *    a                 : Semi-major axis of ellipsoid, in meters   (output)

 *    Origin_Latitude   : Latitude in radians at which the          (output)
 *                          point scale factor is 1.0

Sorry, I could not disagree more.  It may be fine for verbosity
in COBOL procedures designed for accountants and others not trained
in mathematics and not used to the concept of abstract symbols
but is has no place in mathematical code---which is what the
details of cartographic projections are all about.

If you want to know what is going on inside a projection you must
refer to the source document such as Snyder's "Map Projections---A
Working Manual."  Coding follows fairly closely the symbols in
the published equations.  Secondly, the code is written by a
mathematical programmer for a mathematical programmer,
one who is used to abstract symbols.

One important point I failed to mention is the ability for a
program to use multiple instances of an individual projection
executing at the same time in the same program.  For example,
two UTMs could be processing two different ellipsoids when
transfering one datum to another.  PROJ.4/libproj4 will do
that but Geotrans?  I doubt it.

A few more comments below.

You failed your own philosophy.  The first two factors should read:

If you want comments, look up the equations.  You'll see what is going
on then.

BTW, about 27 of the 80 lines in PJ_merc.c are boilerplate comments
so the meaningful lines are only about 53 lines.  Libproj4 version.

All the above stuff should be in the manual and there is no point in
duplicating it in the code.

Another point here: why do we repeat this information over and over
in each projection when it is common to ALL projections.  PROJ.4 and
libproj4 recognize this and there is one common procedure that takes
care of these parameters prior to making an initialization call to 
the individual projection.

First of all, to each his own.  Secondly there are plenty of macros in

Gerald et al. -

"If you want comments, look up the equations.  You'll see what is going
on then."

"All the above stuff should be in the manual and there is no point in
duplicating it in the code."

I've managed software developers for over 20 years, and anyone making
those claims to me would get a stern rebuke, and if made in an
employment interview, would guarantee the speaker to NOT get a job
offer.

It appears that the PROJ code is written in a style very much to
Gerald's liking.  This is hardly surprising.  It would be much more
helpful if relatively OBJECTIVE observers made comments on the value of
each body of code, particularly as it pertains to how it met their
needs.

Turning this into a belly-bumping contest does not help solve anyone's
problems.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Proj.4 vs Geotrans
Message-ID: <3E8715F7.9020601@pobox.com>

Folks,

I would agree with the all the non-code style related statements so far
about the differences between Geotrans and PROJ.4.  I would like to add a
couple of additional points in favour of PROJ.4

   1) PROJ.4 has a well defined syntax for describing projections and
      coordinate systems for the end user, while Geotrans just has the API
      arguments. (I have a similar issue with GCTP)

   2) PROJ.4 has an active accessable public user community for help and
      feedback.

On the whole issue of source code style, and commenting.  I extracted the
3/7 parameter datum shifting support in PROJ.4 from Geotrans and I found the
Geotrans code very understandable to a layman such as myself.  I have never
felt comfortable pointing folks to the PROJ.4 code as a reference due to it's
relative inscrutibility.

In fact, I feel the good (if somewhat verbose) style of Geotrans speaks well
of the hard lessons learned by the military about development of software
systems.  Some of the pendantic rules they apply to development projects
these days are worthwhile.

I am also embarrassed to admit I don't own *any* texts, journals, or papers
on projections, or geodesy.  This is partly pathetic on my part, but should
also highlight that lots of people who may end up needing to understand the
code base may be ill equiped by background or references to deal with it
properly.  It isn't necessarily Gerald's problem to document everything for
me but this sort of situation will arise.

Best regards,

Folks,

We are all pleased to see Gerald actively working on the projections code
in PROJ.4 again; however, as he feel strongly about keeping projections code
separate from some of the other "coordinate systems" related services he has
released a stripped down version of PROJ that just does projections.

It is my intention, as time permits, to prepare a new PROJ 4.5.x release based
on Geralds' projections library.  Due to Geralds' concerns about keeping
things distinct this will involve some dislocations to applications.  Some
entry points, and include files will change names.

I don't have a schedule for this work being completed.  It may take a several
months.  In the meantime I plan to release a 4.4.7 release with NTv2 support
in a day or two and another release or two of the 4.4.x series may take
place before the new generation is available.

Best regards,

Hello.

Thanks for your answers about the comparation between Geotrans and
Proj.4. I like the identifiers and comments of Geotrans, but I'll just
use the API so the source code is not very important to me. Nevertheless
I think its better to have a clear source code.

Now I have another question about datums shifts. I have seen that Proj.4
works with lots of proyections and ellipsoids, but there are only a
few datums:

__datum_id__ __ellipse___ __definition/comments______________________________
       WGS84 WGS84        towgs84=0,0,0

Does Proj.4 support other datums?

Well as long as we are putting experience on the line I have been
writing code for 44 years and about 38 of those years I have had some
association with cartographic projections.  So that's my belly bump.

Secondly, I wrote an opinion, not a job application.  You certainly
may have your own opinion about how code should be written but until
you make your view of coding public there is nothing to comment on.

I am sure I would have an appropriate response to your threatened
"stern rebuke."

Jesus,

I like to this of these more as examples than anything just now.  Since I
don't have an obvious naming system to apply, and because for many datums
folks have different wgs84 shift parameters they like to use depending on
their area of work and so forth, I have avoided populating a large list
of datums.  You can provide you own datum definition in a definition by
supplying the +towgs84= parameter yourself (and the ellipsoid def).

There are some examples of this in the epsg file, though for EPSG datums
with more than one available transformation to WGS84 I did not produce any.

Gerald -

I do not think your responses have really been very focused on the
question put by Jesus.  I don't agree that your opinions of software
commenting and coding style are really intended to help answer him, and
help him to make a good decision about what software tools to use.  He
can see the code quite easily and he can develop his own opinions about
whether he finds the coding, commenting, and variable naming conventions
helpful or unhelpful.

Continuing to spout opinions that basically say "that's the way I do it,
and I've been doing it for a long time, and I have to say I really think
it's the right way to do things" adds nothing.  I *might* be interested
in hearing from the people who have picked up your code over the last 44
years and had to work on it, but even that's not relevant to this
discussion.

If you are interested in helping to answer Jesus' question, it would
great if you could offer comments on the various features and benefits
of PROJ.  You don't seem to be very familiar with GeoTrans - you said so
yourself - so you might simply note that point and leave it to others
who might know it better, rather than "drag[ging] it down", as you put
it, and opining on it.

Well as long as we are putting experience on the line I have been
writing code for 44 years and about 38 of those years I have had some
association with cartographic projections.  So that's my belly bump.

Secondly, I wrote an opinion, not a job application.  You certainly
may have your own opinion about how code should be written but until
you make your view of coding public there is nothing to comment on.

I am sure I would have an appropriate response to your threatened
"stern rebuke."

Folks -

Sorry - that last message was MEANT to be off-list to Gerald privately.
I didn't mean to keep adding fuel to the on-list debate.

Hi there.

Working users should always stick with stable released versions of code (in
this case the current source release marked as such) on:

  http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/

Possibly a note could be added to emphasize that fact on the web page.

CVS is meant to be used by developers as code goes through possibly major
and difficult changes.  The general understanding on every project I have
ever worked on is that HEAD CVS code is by definition unstable and to be
treated with caution.

Consequently, I think that Frank is entitled to use CVS in this way,
especially as he took the trouble to warn others of potential difficulties.

I know of three open source projects where insufficient use of CVS by
developers has contributed to major problems.  In one case, a hard disk
crash caused the loss of the entire Windows port of the Rosegarden MIDI
sequencer - that project has never been revived.  In the other two projects
(Maxima and Gnu Common Lisp) the unfortunate and unexpected death of the
maintainer (without having committed vital files to CVS) meant that many
people have worked long hours over an entire year to put the projects back
on track.  (Naturally, I hope Frank won't be negotiating the latter event in
his life for some time!)

Cheers

Mike Thomas.

Paul,

I just wanted to let you know that I have committed your file of extra
ESRI coordinate systems as osrs/proj/nad/esri.extra, and the osrs/proj/nad/esri
file is a merger of the current epsg file and the esri.extra.

This will go out in the 4.4.7 release today.

Best regards,

That surely happenned because of the unfortunate use of the header field

Folks,

PROJ 4.4.7 is now released, and available for download from the PROJ.4 web
site.

   http://www.remotesensing.org/proj

 From the NEWS file:

4.4.7 Release Notes
-------------------

  o Added NTv2 (.gsb) grid shift file support.

  o Modified datum shift support so that data file data is only loaded if
    needed.  Also added 'null' grid as a fallback option, and support for
    making grids optional (prefix with '@' in +nadgrids).

  o Regenerated nad/epsg file with towgs84 parameters for non-greenwich prime
    meridians.

  o Updated nad/esri file with better generated form from Paul Ramsey.

  o Various bug fixes.

Best regards,

--

Do you know if there are some list ready to use with Proj.4?
I have downloaded the EPSG database (Access) but maybe somebody already have
a list of datums ready to download :-)

Thanks

Jesus,

The proj/nad/epsg file contains definitions for most/all 2D projected and
geographic coordinate systems.  Some do not have towgs84 parameters either
because I could not deduce one from the EPSG database, or because it offered
more than one so I couldn't be sure which was "best".

You can use the epsg file with the +init mechanism. For instance, the
following "cs2cs" commandline would be for converting from EPSG 27700 (British
National Grid) to WGS84 lat/long.

eg.
cs2cs +init=epsg:27700 +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84

Best regards,
