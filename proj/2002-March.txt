Message-ID: <3C837510.8010009@schaferdc.com>

Frank/all:

Contrary to its man page (and to the behavior of proj/invproj) cs2cs does not echo arbitrary 
trailing (after the X,Y
values) ASCII characters on its input lines.  Instead it is presently hardwired to read and print a 
z value.  For my
current application I much prefer the proj behavior, so I modified my copy as below.  I leave it to 
you to decide if
this is a change you want to incorporate.
================

in cs2cs.c, subroutine process():

comment out the line that reads z:

           //z = strtod( s, &s );

and change the lines that print z to:

           //putchar(' ');
           //printf( "%.3f", z );
           //fputs("\n", stdout );
	(void)fputs( s, stdout);

Hello All,
Where can I find a complete documentation of the following exported function
from the proj.dll?

pj_init
pj_fwd
pj_inv
pj_free
pj_transform
pj_geocentric_to_geodetic
pj_geodetic_to_geocentric
pj_deallocate_grids
pj_init_plus
pj_latlong_from_proj
pj_is_latlong
pj_get_errno_ref
pj_set_finder
pj_strerrno
pj_errno

If not, can anyone share his/her understanding on any of them? and if
possible
with sample codes? or even test programs?
I have now started using the proj4. I have constructed Visual C++ for the
main
dll, applications (*.exe) and simple testing programs.
I hope to provide a simple COM wrapper for the above exported functions, to
be
used in VB and other projects.

Also, trying to design a control which will serve as some form of
user-interface to
the EPSG file.
Please let me know some of the things you wish to be done. I do not have the
technical
knowledge yet to fix bugs in the algorithm :-) However, I will try to make
it easier to use
for the Windows programmer and I also make it ready for my own programs.

Finally, I will be looking into how the proposed OpenGIS coordinate
transformation COM
interfaces can be exposed by the proj4, and how we could pull all into the
.NET platform,
stay tuned!

Currently, working with the version 4.5.5. Any input will be highly
appreciated. Unfortunately,
this is mainly for the Windows programmer.

To the Windows programmers, do you really use the utility programs like the
Nad2Nad.exe?
Will you prefer a COM interface instead. Please let me know you needs :-)

Please post any large file you wish to share directly to me in order not to
choke others

Hello Frans,

> Have been able to compile the whole code without any warnings?

Yes, it went without warning at the VC++ warning level 3 (the default).
Actually, the #include <project.h> caused a lot of warning, but I fixed it
by telling the compiling to use the project directory as additional
"include"
directory and that was all.

The utilities, however, need some extra work.

> I am very intressted in your development of a com-inteface.

I need it too :-)

> Please let me know your progress.

The only thing is to understand the exported functions very well and
then wrap them. The OpenGIS stuff may however involve a little bit
of reading but I will give it a try,

Best regards,
Paul.

The utility programs are well documented in the PDF documentation.
But the library is really not-trying to gather the pieces here and there!

This does not do COM well.

COM will be easier to use under Delphi, and many other environment.
Besides you do not have to be worried about DLL hell, which may results
from the sample name.

> I've compiled then Library under BCC 5.5 to be

I am planning to use ATL for the COM and BCC 5.5 is known to compile COM
well. You might have to download the ATL library from MSDN as part of the
Win32 SDK.

I am working on some proposals and interfaces for the COM part and will post
this soon.

Best regards,
Paul.

Yes, this functions will form the basis. However, I am looking into how to
expose more
interfaces to perform some (if not all) of the work being done by the
utilities or tools (like
the cs2cs.exe) currently.
Also, some of the configuration files used by the utilities which hardly
change could be
added to the project as resource file to present a compact distributable
component.
Still investigating so new ideas and suggestions are welcomed.

Best regards,
Paul.

Hello All,
I guess I may have to be posting some issues on my work on VC++ build,
so I decided to start Part number :-)

I have to correct my earlier statements that there was no warning with the
VC++ build-I do not know what happened exactly now, getting enough.
However, I will to correct or better still eliminate some of them.

Question 1:
In which header file is the function freev2 defined in vector1.c declared?

It is used in both bch2bps.c and mk_cheby.c. The compiler gave warning, I
searched but could not find it declared in any header.

Best regards,
Paul.

They make the sources difficult to read (and of course debug-not doing this

Question 3:
The LP macros is define in winnt.h as

I have not had problem with it yet, but is it not better to redefine this?

Indeed, the during the port to Java it took me a while to pick all of the 
macros apart.  Its often worth running just the pre-possessor to get the 
source with these macros expanded. (-E on gcc, I'm afraid I have no idea 
about VC++)

Paul,

While some of the coding approaches in PROJ aren't what I would have done,
they work fine, and I am not inclined to rework a bunch of code for
clarity.

> Question 3:
> The LP macros is define in winnt.h as
> typedef LPWSTR LP (line 258)

Let me know if you encounter a problem.  I have tried to separate things
into proj_api.h which is public declarations, and hopefully just the stuff
that applications really need, and projects.h which includes lots of
internal stuff, some of which will conflict with windows.h and friends.

It is my intentions to make proj_api.h easy to mix with other include files,
but not so with projects.h.

Best regards,

Harald,

I didn't answer because I am always getting confused about the terminology
for some of the different transforms.  There is a three and seven
parameter transform implemented; however, I am not certain that the
interpretation of the parameters (sign, handedness, etc) is exactly what
is defined for helmert and molodenski.  I think it is though.

First, no actual datum shift is being applied in this case because PROJ
doesn't equate +ellps=WGS84 with the WGS84 datum automatically.  I realized
this when I did the conversion without the +towgs84 parameter and got the
same results.  Please use +datum=WGS84 to force treatment of the lat/long
coordinates as being the WGS84 datum.

Howwever, this doesn't seem to get us any closer to your expected values.

warmerda at gdal[355]% cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel 
+lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +x_0=4500000 +towgs84=-586,-87,-409 < test.dat
4409793.19      5747857.54 1386.040

I tried reversing the sign of the offset, as this is a frequent incompatibility,
and get:

warmerda at gdal[356]% cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel 
+lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +x_0=4500000 +towgs84=586,87,409 < test.dat
4409847.28      5748282.64 11.504

This is close to what you expect in the northing (2m), but no so close in the
easting - still off by 70m or so.  I am no sure what else to say.

I understand. However, the reason for these posts is because I wish to work
on
this as far as possible. I will be using the library in my company's
product. However,
it does not make any sense to keep my modifications. So, I wish to involve
all so that
the results will be used and also not be seen as a fork of the original
project.

In fact, there will actually be a fork-a complete standard C++ version, but
before then
I am working to clean up the C version too. To move to the C++, I will need
to understand
the inner working, at least the flow of the current version.
I am documenting all my changes, I had to modify some lines, do some casting
to make
the current source compile under VC++ without any warning (initially had
over 190 warnings),
some due to the macros resulting in uninitialized values.

I have not actually started using the library in any project yet, just
getting it ready. So, that
was just a suggestion and also to find out if anyone had a problem with it.
There is also PVALUE
defined in Windows header. Since, I am now using the VC++ IDE some of these
are easy to pick
up.

I will post the complete project by this weekend so that others could start
looking at it.

Best regards,
Paul.

Dear Frank,

The Europeans like to do their rotations in an opposite direction from the
rest of the world when doing 7-parameter Datum Shifts.  Translation and
Scale Factors remain the same.  e.g., you will get weird and unexplainable
results if you rotate in the wrong direction.

A Helmert transform done with geocentric coordinates in three dimensions is
called a Helmert Direct from Geodetic to Geocentric, and is called a
Helmert Inverse from Geocentric to Geodetic.

Molodensky-Badekas does a 3-d Helmert direct to geocentric coordinates,
subtracts the geocentric coordinates of the classical Datum origin, then
does the 7-parameter, then finally does the Helmert inverse back to the new
Datum's geodetic coordinates.

Bursa-Wolf does a 3-d Helmert direct to geocentric coordinates, does NOT
subtract the geocentric coordinates of the classical Datum origin, then
does the 3-parameter, or 4-parameter, or 7-parameter, then finally does the
Helmert inverse back to the new Datum's geodetic coordinates.

How do you tell which direction to rotate?  It is impossible unless you
have a test point.  Since Harald does have a test point ...

So now you know.

Harald,

I didn't answer because I am always getting confused about the terminology
for some of the different transforms.  There is a three and seven
parameter transform implemented; however, I am not certain that the
interpretation of the parameters (sign, handedness, etc) is exactly what
is defined for helmert and molodenski.  I think it is though.

First, no actual datum shift is being applied in this case because PROJ
doesn't equate +ellps=WGS84 with the WGS84 datum automatically.  I realized
this when I did the conversion without the +towgs84 parameter and got the
same results.  Please use +datum=WGS84 to force treatment of the lat/long
coordinates as being the WGS84 datum.

Howwever, this doesn't seem to get us any closer to your expected values.

warmerda at gdal[355]% cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc
+ellps=bessel
+lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +x_0=4500000 +towgs84=-586,-87,-409 < test.dat
4409793.19      5747857.54 1386.040

I tried reversing the sign of the offset, as this is a frequent
incompatibility,
and get:

warmerda at gdal[356]% cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc
+ellps=bessel
+lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +x_0=4500000 +towgs84=586,87,409 < test.dat
4409847.28      5748282.64 11.504

This is close to what you expect in the northing (2m), but no so close in
the
easting - still off by 70m or so.  I am no sure what else to say.

Best regards,

Professor Mugnier,

Thank you very much for these indications.
They will be most helpful when consulting
the libraries here in Paris. I didn't really
know where to start until today.

Cordially and thankfully yours,
