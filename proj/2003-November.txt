Claude,

The typical reason this would happen is that in upgrading to a newer EPSG
database a new TOWGS84 option became available.  The current translation
software, does not emit a towgs84 clause in the PROJ.4 file if there is more
than one transformation available in the EPSG database.

Markus,

I have taken the liberty of cc:ing the proj list since this may be of
general interest.

My methodology is rather multi-step.

  o I dump the EPSG Microsoft Access database to .csv files (those distributed
    with libgeotiff).

  o I then derive the pcs.csv, gcs.csv and gdal_datum.csv files from those
    dumped files using a few python scripts.  These are the scripts that make
    decisions such as to avoid emitting any "towgs84" information if there is
    more than one "path" available in EPSG.   These scripts can be found in the
    libgeotiff/csv directory (csv_tools.py, and build_pcs.py).

  o Then the proj.4 epsg file is created by running the epsg_tr.py script
    from "gdal/pymod" on the full set of epsg GCS and PCS values.  The result
    is the epsg file.

The build_pcs.py script is really the hairy part and encapsulates the logic
that likely needs improvement. The other part particularly pertenant to
PROJ.4 is the C++ logic in GDAL for converting it's internal representation
of a coordinate system into PROJ.4 format which is (I think) working pretty
well within the  limits of the source data.

Yvain,

This is more properly a PROJ.4 issue.  I have built PROJ.4 with Visual Studio
.NET, but not the most recent version of that.  It would appear it is getting
more picky all the time.

The likely issue with PJconsts is that the structure includes the PROJ_PARMS__
macro, which basically expands to be a different set of projection specific
parameters in each of the low level projection support files.  I guess Visual
Studio is trying to keep track of all this for debugging purposes and is getting
confused.

Are you using the default makefile.vc build definitions?  By default the
OPTFLAGS is set to /Ox with no debug support enabled.  I would have thought
this would have avoided such issues.

I am not intending to upgrade to this compiler in the immediate future so
I can't really offer to fix the problem ... whatever that fix might be.
I would suggest you just grab a PROJ.DLL and corresponding import library
from a Visual Studio 6 build and use that.

Best regards,

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] problem with nad_init and initializing ntv1_can.dat
Message-ID: <3FBC2BE8.1040201@ccalmr.ogi.edu>

Hello all,

Perhaps someone here can help.

Previously, I have used the proj C library version 4.4.5 on an SGI irix 
machine without difficulties. However, I have recently installed 
proj4.4.7 on an intel i386 Linux machine. When I attempt to run this 
piece of C code (which works using proj v4.4.5):



#include <string.h>
#include <projects.h>

   static  struct CTABLE *ctab, *htab, *cantab;
   static  PJ *cnv_array;
   static  char *parms[] = {"init=nad27:3601"};
   static int n_parm = 1;
   static char nad_area[]= "WO",conus[]="conus",canada[]="ntv1_can.dat";

int main (int argc, char **argv)
{

     cnv_array = pj_init(n_parm,parms);
     if (!(htab = nad_init(nad_area))){
         fprintf(stderr,"nad_init for parms failed due to 
%s\n",pj_strerrno(pj_errno));
         exit(1);
     }
     if (!(ctab = nad_init(conus))){
         fprintf(stderr,"nad_init for conus failed due to 
%s\n",pj_strerrno(pj_errno));
         exit(1);
     }
     if (!(cantab = nad_init(canada))){
         fprintf(stderr,"nad_init for canada failed due to 
%s\n",pj_strerrno(pj_errno));
         exit(1);
     }
}

I get the error message:
"nad_init for canada failed due to failed to load NAD27-83 correction file"

The files WO, conus, and ntv1_can.dat are located in 
/usr/local/share/proj in both systems, and the files are readable by all 
users on both systems.

I read the source code for nad_init.c in release 4.4.7, and (unless I am 
completely misreading the code) it doesn't appear to support the ntv1 
(or the ntv2) formats. Older versions of nad_init.c (version 1.6 and 
previous) contained a function nad_load_ntv1, which was called by 
nad_init if the header portion of the file did not meet the expected 
format. The new version of nad_init.c lacks the nad_load_ntv1 function. 
The new version also lacks a function to load ntv2 files (even though it 
specifies that it now provides preliminary ntv2 support).

I am wondering if the functions for handling the initialization of the 
Canadian datums NTv1 and NTv2 have been moved out of nad_init into some 
other function, or whether these functions have somehow been lost. I 
have looked through the mailing list archives for any mention of this 
problem, and I have not found anything.

Any help that anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.

Charles,

The short answer is "yes".  The datum shifting code was substantially
restructured when NTv2 support was incorporated last winter.  The nad_init
is just used for old style PROJ.4 datum shift files, and not for
NTv1 or NTv2 files.

I would strongly encourage you to use the pj_init() and pj_transform()
functions to do datum shifts if possible.  So, for instance, to apply
a datum shift from NAD27 to NAD83 create a projPJ handle for
"+proj=latlong +nadgrids=ntv1_can.dat" and "+proj=latlong +datum=NAD83" using
pj_init_plus(), then use pj_transform() to convert between them.

If you have to go in deeper review the pj_datum_transform(),
pj_apply_gridshift() and various gridinfo functions to better understand
how things work.

Best regards,

Hello

I want to transform a pair of angular coordinates in datum WGS84 to NTF
Lambert 2. I have written this line :

./cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=GRS80 +to +proj=lcc +lat_0=46.8000
+lat_1=46.8000 +lon_0=2.3372291 +k_0=0.99987742 +x_0=600000 +y_0=200000
+a=6378249.2 +b=6356515 +ellps=clrk80

The input coordinates are :

2d39'48882"E 48d32'8575"N

But the coordinates transformed come out wrong and i don't understand why :

1575621.19      743408.43 0.00

(the coordinates should turn around these values :

 600000 2400000
)

Does any one have the solution to this, or at least some in depth
documentation on how to use proj ?

Frank,

  I'm trying to work through a problem using proj4 to do datum conversions
using NTv2 (the Canadian NAD83/27 datum shift grid file).  It seems that
Proj4 goes through the list of U.S and Canadian grids as specified in
pj_datums.c (line 75):

nadgrids=@conus, at alaska, at ntv2_0.gsb, at ntv1_can.dat

and uses the first one that returns a reasonable result.  So when I do a
conversion on 49N 122W, it chooses the conus grid instead of the ntv2_0.gsb
grid.

I see that with cs2cs I can set the shift file by specifying
"+nadgrids=ntv2_0.gsb". Is there a way I can set the shift file to use using
a proj4 function call (I'm making a VB-callable DLL) ?

Thanks!

Brent,

I am not sure I understand your constraints.  The shift file selected (and
they order they are checked for) is determined by the +nadgrids entry in
a coordinate system definition as passed to pj_init().   You can't really
alter the built-in datum definitions (+datum=nad27 is really just an alias
for the corresponding +nadgrids definition).

Aurelie,

The main problem is your DMS specification: 2d39'48882"E.  I imagine
you mean 2d39'48.882"E (that is 48.882 seconds, not 48882 seconds).
You may also find you need to include +towgs84=0,0,0 in the NTF coordinate
system to ensure that the ellipsoid conversion is done, even though no datum
shift info is available.

With the DMS specs fixed I get:

warmerda at gdal2200[265]% cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=GRS80 +to +proj=lcc +lat_0=46.8000 +lat_1=46.8000 
+lon_0=2.3372291 +k_0=0.99987742 +x_0=600000 +y_0=200000 +a=6378249.2 +b=6356515 +ellps=clrk80 +towgs84=0,0,0
2d39'48.882"E 48d32'85.72"N
624110.53       395817.08 83.91

This value looks reasonable.  I am not sure why you were thinking the
northing should be in the range of 2400000m.  48d32' is less than 2 degrees
north of the reference point (46.8) and a degree is roughly 100000m.  So
the value I got (395817m N) is roughly 2 degrees north of the reference point
which makes sense.

Note that without good datum shift information the precision of the
conversion will not be great.

Good luck,

I get it now.

The way I set up my functions was to define a "from" and "to" coordinate
system definition (here's my VB):

    sToCSD = "+proj=latlong +datum=NAD27"
    hToCSD = GPinitializeProjection(sToCSD) ' a VB friendly wrapper to
pj_init

    sFrCSD = "+proj=latlong +datum=NAD83"
    hFrCSD = GPinitializeProjection(sFrCSD)' a VB friendly wrapper to
pj_init

    status = GPdatum2datum(hFrCSD, hToCSD, -122, 49, newLon, newLat) ' a VB
friendly wrapper to pj_transform


It never occured to me to simply add the nadgrids keyword to the NAD27
coordinate system def:
    sToCSD = "+proj=latlong +datum=NAD27 +nadgrids=NTv2_0.gsb"

Thanks!
Brent

Brent,

I would add that you should not include a +datum and a +nadgrids clause
as it becomes ambiguous whether the +nadgrids from the +datum will be used
or the standalone one you include. So the better forumulation would
be "+proj=latlong +ellps=clrk66 +nadgrids=NTv2_0.gsb".

Best regards,

Thank you, it's the good value.
In the 2400000, the 2 correspond to the 2 of the lambert 2 in France but
it's normal that it doesn't appear in the value.

Aurelie,

The main problem is your DMS specification: 2d39'48882"E.  I imagine
you mean 2d39'48.882"E (that is 48.882 seconds, not 48882 seconds).
You may also find you need to include +towgs84=0,0,0 in the NTF coordinate
system to ensure that the ellipsoid conversion is done, even though no datum
shift info is available.

With the DMS specs fixed I get:

warmerda at gdal2200[265]% cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +ellps=GRS80 +to
+proj=lcc +lat_0=46.8000 +lat_1=46.8000
+lon_0=2.3372291 +k_0=0.99987742 +x_0=600000 +y_0=200000 +a=6378249.2
+b=6356515 +ellps=clrk80 +towgs84=0,0,0
2d39'48.882"E 48d32'85.72"N
624110.53       395817.08 83.91

This value looks reasonable.  I am not sure why you were thinking the
northing should be in the range of 2400000m.  48d32' is less than 2 degrees
north of the reference point (46.8) and a degree is roughly 100000m.  So
the value I got (395817m N) is roughly 2 degrees north of the reference
point
which makes sense.

Note that without good datum shift information the precision of the
conversion will not be great.

Good luck,

Frank,

  Many thanks for the info.    I ran into a nasty problem related I think to
the linked gridlist and pj_gridinfo_init.

My solution/work-around was to set the PROJ_LIB environment variable in
Windows to:
        PROJ_LIB=C:/proj/nad
instead of
        PROJ_LIB=/proj/nad

but I don't know why that works.  The first datum transformation my software
requested worked, but the second failed due to an fopen failure in
pj_open_lib when trying to open NTv2_0.gsb

I'm reluctant to debug it due to time constraints and the fact that I'm not
familiar enough with the datum portion of Proj, but I thought I would
mention it in case others had a similar problem.

Please note that the problem does NOT exist in cs2cs.exe (it works just fine
for NTv2 datum conversions.)

Thanks again,
Brent
