Subject: [Proj] 3TM projection string
Message-ID: <200712020422.30245.webtmc@telusplanet.net>

Greetings all,

I'm working with map data from Lethbridge, Alberta, Cananda that's in NAD83 
3TM projection. I'm having trouble locating details about the projection 
other than it's a 3 degree projection with -114 as the cental meridian. I'm 
working with qgis and I tried copying one of the other MTM projections and 
changing it to: 

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-114 +k=0.999900 +x_0=304800 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 
+datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs

Would this work? Thanks so much.

oh yes, my fault! It shows me that I didn't really understand
what I'm doing with PROJ.4 :-)

OK, if I add "+datum=WGS84" to the "+to" part I get the same
result as with V4.5.0 (still wrong in respect of ticket 1531).
Despite that, isn't it true that the grid file contains 
datum definition for both (from and to) system? So isn't
it better to assume datum definition for both systems, if
a grid is specified? What also confuses is that the destination
datum isn't really WGS84 in this case, but the slightly 
different ETRS89.

Anyhow, I think the change breaks backward compatibility and this
has to be documented very well. All of my old scripts have to 
be patched to give the right results.

Another question: When an how do these changes affect GDAL/OGR?

Thanks in advance and best regards
Uwe

Uwe,

PROJ.4 implicitly assumes that datum grids map from the
local datum to WGS84 but the output coordinate system can
be other than WGS84 so I don't agree that the nadgrids
implies the whole transformation.

 > What also confuses is that the destination
> datum isn't really WGS84 in this case, but the slightly 
> different ETRS89.

Because the PROJ nadgrids directive does not understand that
there can exist grids going to coordinate systems other than
WGS84 it is necessary to fool it. So you declare your output
coordinate system as +datum=WGS84 but *you* know that you want
to inteprete the output coordinates as ETRS89.

Getting to your core problem, I stepped through the code and found
that PROJ is not attempting to apply a bessel to WGS84 ellipsoid
change in your case.   After the gridshift file is applied it
internally updates it's concept of source ellipsoid to be WGS84.

Unfortunately, it uses a WGS84 "es" value that is slightly different
than the one that results from +datum=WGS84 so it thinks the
input and output coordinate system still have different ellipsoids
and it goes through geocentric space to correct this.  I have modified
pj_transform.c to use the same WGS84 es value that is used with
+datum=WGS84 and now this processing is avoided, and your exact expected
output value is produced again.  This change will appear in beta2.

Thanks for highlighting the bug 1531 issue.

> Another question: When an how do these changes affect GDAL/OGR?

GDAL/OGR uses PROJ.4 for transformations and so the change also
applies to GDAL/OGR (and MapServer, GRASS, etc).  For the most
part it should mean people no longer need to be hyper-aware of
the interals of PROJ as things will start to work the way folks
expect.

For what it's worth, MapInfo does that same thing. This behavior has
caught me off guard a few times, but it's really pretty logical.

I have finally had a chance to check this. Sorry it took so long. I do
not get much difference. Could you give me a few sample lat/longs and
the northings/eastings you get with this command? I did have to change
the zone to 30 for Madrid for my tests, os the derived values were very
far off.

Do you build PROJ.4 yourself?
Have you installed Service Pack 1 for Visual Studio 2005?
What error/message/... you are getting?

Thanks for your suggestions.
I had sp1 for VS2005. I both used the 446 proj version already built for
windows and also I compiled on Vista the new 4.5 version. In both cases it
did not work. The message I get is Access Violation every time I try to call
something like prj.ToString()
or pj_init or pj_get_errno_ref()

Hi,

I wish to plot several points in Canada, but the problem is that the
points are plotted at the wrong location. My data are in decimal degree
stored in a CSV file. I am guessing that Map Server plots the points  in
meters instead of degree.

I used this in my map layer:
PROJECTION
   "init=epsg:42304"
END

I added this for epsg:
<42304> +proj=lcc +lat_1=49 +lat_2=77 +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-95 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
+ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs  no_defs <>

I try changing:
 - <42304> +proj=lcc +lat_1=49 +lat_2=77 +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-95 +x_0=0
+y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=dd +no_defs  no_defs <> ....
this causes a msProcessProjection(): Projection library error. unknown
unit conversion id error
 - UNITS METERS to UNITS DD in my map file, but that doesn't help.

Sample DATA:
 <<img.GIF>> 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa19",0,200000
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa20",0,220000
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa21",0,240000
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa30",0,300000
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa31",10000,300000


Any help is much appreciated

Toan -

 

This is probably a better question for the MapServer list, but you're on
the wrong path.  Put the 42304 definition back the way it was - that's
correct.

 

The EPSG:42304 projection is a Lambert Conformal Conic projection, and I
assume that's what you want to use for your OUTPUT map image.  Its units
are not in decimal degrees, nor can they be.  You have an INPUT data
layer in decimal degrees, and you'd like MapServer to reproject that
data to your output projection.

 

Your top-level MAP file needs the PROJECTION definition you describe
below, and then you also need to have an appropriate PROJECTION block
inside the LAYER definition for the layer in decimal degrees.  That
tells MapServer that your input and output data are in different
projections, and the data need to be reprojected.

 

The correct EPSG definition for your input data in decimal degrees will
depend on what datum those coordinates use.

Subject: [Proj] Data Plotted at Wrong Location

 

Hi, 

I wish to plot several points in Canada, but the problem is that the
points are plotted at the wrong location. My data are in decimal degree
stored in a CSV file. I am guessing that Map Server plots the points  in
meters instead of degree.

I used this in my map layer: 
PROJECTION 
   "init=epsg:42304" 
END 

I added this for epsg: 
<42304> +proj=lcc +lat_1=49 +lat_2=77 +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-95 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
+ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs  no_defs <>

I try changing: 
 - <42304> +proj=lcc +lat_1=49 +lat_2=77 +lat_0=49 +lon_0=-95 +x_0=0
+y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83 +units=dd +no_defs  no_defs <> ....
this causes a msProcessProjection(): Projection library error. unknown
unit conversion id error

 - UNITS METERS to UNITS DD in my map file, but that doesn't help. 

Sample DATA: 
<<img.GIF>> 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa19",0,200000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa20",0,220000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa21",0,240000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa30",0,300000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa31",10000,300000 

 

Any help is much appreciated 
Thanks

Ed, thank you for your quick reply.
 
Initially, I have: 
PROJECTION 
   "init=epsg:42304" 
END 
specified in both my top-level MAP and proper layer, with UNITS METERS.
 
But when the map was draw, all the points are plotted very closed
togeather. 
I suspect that for some reason, the map-server is plotting the data as
meter instead of degree decimal.
 
The points/data I used from the previous post was for investigation
purpose... to test why the points/data was so closed together.
They are:
Desc,,X,Y
"5",79.725833,43.715361
"6",81.000107,43.368512
"7",-78.347276,44.301459
"8",,81.332038,48.47381
"9",79.68955,43.4662
...
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa19",0,200000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa20",0,220000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa21",0,240000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa30",0,300000 
"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa31",10000,300000 

Sorry about the confusion.
 
I will try posting this in the MapServer list
 
Thank you for the hint.

	I guess, the command I've suggested half a year ago in [1]:

$ gdalwarp -of HFA \
      -s_srs '+proj=sinu +R=6371007.181 +nadgrids=@null +wktext' \
      -t_srs TARGET-SRS \
      'HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"fpar8.hdf":MOD_Grid_MOD15A2:Fpar_1km' \
      fpar8.hfa

	could now be rewritten as:

$ gdalwarp -of HFA \
      -s_srs '+proj=sinu +R=6371007.181 +datum=WGS84' \
      -t_srs TARGET-SRS \
      'HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"fpar8.hdf":MOD_Grid_MOD15A2:Fpar_1km' \
      fpar8.hfa

	(i. e., the source projection is spherical, but the coordinates
	used are the WGS84 ones)?  If yes, that's good!  May I suggest
	updating [2] then as well?

	Or do I miss something?

Gok,

I am not aware of a WKT to FGDC XML translator though I do maintain
a half assed WKT to GML translator.

Gennady,

The C++ class used for this is OGRSpatialReference and it is part of
my GDAL/OGR library (http://www.gdal.org).  The OGRSpatialReference
class supports translating between a variety of coordinate system
formats, including WKT (it's internal representaton), PROJ.4, GML
(weak really), and a few other esoteric options.  A reasonable primer
on the services is available at:

   http://www.gdal.org/ogr/osr_tutorial.html

Incidentally, this is the class uses to generate the PROJ.4 "epsg" init
file.

Gennady,

The OGC 01-009 specification includes definitions of WKT and XML encodings
for coordinate systems.  The WKT encoding is the basis of the WKT in GDAL/OGR
though I only implement some portions of it.

I did some early work to support the XML encoding but that has been discarded
in favor of the GML coordinate system encoding.  I am not aware of any real
world use of the 01-009 XML encoding.  It is effectively superceded by GML
encoding.

Message-ID: <C5E5B2546EF808498149169747BE928001316B7C@its-srv01.ITS2.local>

Hello,

I am a little new to programming with maps but I've been trying to solve a particular problem and so far I'm having a hard time sorting out how it would work.  I have a Lambert Conformal Conic map.  I know the False Northing, the False Easting, the Long/Lat pairs for the four corners, the Central Meridian and the Origin of Latitude.  I also know that the Datum is D_Clarke_1866.

So what I'm trying to do (and not succeeding at) is finding a formula or a method of converting my Longitude and Latitude pair that I input and performing the mathematics required to convert that into an (x,y) pair to dynamically place a dot on the map.  The map could be of any size so the formula has to allow for the dimensions of the map to be dynamic.  So the image could be 200 x 200 pixels in size (same map all the time, just in different sizes) and the location of Edmonton, Alberta would be at about (14,156).  Increase the image size to 300 x 300 and the pixels should shift to match the size of the map given all of the data we know about it.

Is this something that proj would be able to asist me with?  Will it perform that kind of transformation?  Any help would be appreciated, my math is a little rusty and so far I've had to relearn trigonometry in a very short time period.  I kind of feel dazed.  :)

Folks,

There haven't been any major problems with the PROJ 4.6.0 beta1 though there
have been a few changes so I've packaged up a 4.6.0 final release:

   http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.6.0.tar.gz
   http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.6.0.zip

The changes since beta1 are:

2007-12-21  Andrey Kiselv  <dron at ak4719.spb.edu>

	* PJ_wag3.c: Added missed "lat_ts" parameter to projection description
	string.

2007-12-20  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* pj_list.h, Makefile.am, PJ_mpoly.c: Removed mpoly projection.  It
	was just a dummy (no actual transformation).

2007-12-06  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* pj_factors.c: in the case of phi=90, the derived should be calculated
	at [90-delta,90] instead of at [90,90+delta] (the same is true for -90)
	http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1605
	
2007-12-03  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* pj_transform.c: Small improvement in WGS84_ES precision to avoid
	an unnecessary trip through geocentric space (eg bug 1531).

2007-11-30  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* add latlon and lonlat as aliases.

Hi,
great to hear that there is a new version of the PROJ library.

I would like to know if there is any news concerning the "well known  
old issueâ€œ regarding the translation of differents angular unites (as  
I've allready mentioned some time ago) ?

And ... I wish PROJ users and devs a merry christmas :)

GÃ©rald,

Is this the issue where some geographic coordinate systems should
be using angular values other than degrees (ie. Gradians)?

There has been no progress on this front, and I must confess it isn't
high on my personal list of priorities.

It's exactly what I spoke about.

I understand, you've allready told me that it's not on the priorities  
list, which I could understand.
My appologies for bothering, I just want to be sure that the new  
version don't allready include this fix :]

Subject: [Proj] Question about Italian conversion
Message-ID: <476F7F34.4050403@studiodemarchi.net>

Hi,
I am a new user, and was performing image conversion with gdalwarp 
between old Italian c.s. (Gauss Boaga) and WGS 84.

I found there is a shift (around 100m)in the conversion. I tested with 
cs2cs and I have the same issue.
The coordinate conversion is the same using both EPSG 3003 or 26591, or 
using the proj4 string taken form spatialreference.org

Starting with 1641163 East and 4997349 North I get
10d47'40.422"E  45d6'52.824"
in place of:
10d47'39.5"E    45d6'55.2"

What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance,
Massimo

Trying to follow the procedure with independent software, I get the
impression that you didn't transform the datum from Hayford to WGS84.
You simply inverse projected from x,y to lon,lat with the proper transverse
mercator projection.
With the Roma40 transform parameters found at <http://crs.bkg.bund.de>
I arrive at lat,lon:
45d 06m 55.252s,  10d 47m 39.415s
assuming a position vector rotation model (ISO) and an initial height of 0.
The proj/epsg definitions you mention don't contain any datum transform
instructions.

With these parameters - in the proper units - I get for x,y:
346319.6988, 4749023.4599 m
Differences with the 'needed' values:
dx = 0.013; dy = 0.174 m
I assumed an 'exact' first-order coordinate frame rotation model, order XYZ,
then scale.
I think the given rotation angles are in radians, so I converted them to arc
seconds.
Note that PROJ uses a position vector rotation model and a simple transform
method.

Hi guys,
I am not sure that this is a right mailing list but probably someone can 
addressing me in the right place.
I am using the Mike Adair proj4js and merc.js code .
The trasformation using cs2cs gives me different result if I use the 
Mike code.
When I transform lon/lat to X/Y the Mike code give me a latitude lower 
then the cs2cs of about 0.200 degrees.
>cs2cs +proj=latlong +to +proj=merc
10.6846908 41.26904150

with the Mike code

1189414.34   5052106.58

Is there someone that has the same problem?
Help will be welcome and appreciated

Thanks for your answer. I tried to do a coordinate transform using the -s_srs
EPSG:3003 (or 26591) and -t_srs EPSG:4326 parameters. How can I add the
necessary datum transform? I checked the documentation amd the forum, but
didn't find a clue.

Regards,
Massimo

Your answer is not too late. I have not sorted this issue. What exactly
did you change to obtain your results? Which angles were in radians
instead of arc seconds? Was there anything else?

You've hooked me...

Martin,

These debug flags is a kind of minimal required set of flags and
do not include all necessary flags between Visual C++ versions.
AFAIU, it's intentional to leave customization of OPTFLAGS to a user.
Your version of flags looks correct to me, for Visual C++ 8.0 (2005).


BTW, I believe this post belongs to proj list than gdal-dev,
so I've added it to CC.

Massimo,

I followed Oscar's link to http://crs.bkg.bund.de but did not see any easily
identifiable datum transformation parameters for the Monte Mario datum.
However, if you can find some appropriate ones they can be specified in the
PROJ.4 string.  EPSG:3003 expands to:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +no_defs

To add datum shift parameters you might use a string like:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=0.9996 +x_0=1500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl
+units=m +towgs84=100,50,25 +no_defs

Insert whatever towgs84 parameter you find are appropriate to the datum.

Best regards,

Here they are (extracted from GRASS GIS source code):

datum.table:rome40      "Monte_Mario"
international dx=-225     dy=-65      dz=9
datumtransform.table:rome40
"towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68" "Italy
(Peninsular Part)" "Accuracy 3-4m"
datumtransform.table:rome40
"towgs84=-168.6,-34.0,38.6,-0.374,-0.679,-1.379,-9.48" "Italy
(Sardinia)" "Accuracy 3-4m"
datumtransform.table:rome40
"towgs84=-50.2,-50.4,84.8,-0.690,-2.012,0.459,-28.08" "Italy (Sicily)"
"Accuracy 3-4m"

They were taken from http://crs.bkg.bund.de.

The rotation angles, so in effect only R3.
If you compare simple transforms (sines/cosines in the rotation matrix are
the same as the angles in rad), then coordinate frame has negated angles
compared to position vector.
If you want to do exact (but still first-order Helmert) transforms, then
you'll have to use a specialized datum transformation tool. In the case at
hand differences will emerge starting from the 5th decimal in
easting/northing. So you might as well use PROJ's simple transform.

PROJ (and CS2CS) works as expected.
PROJ does an ellipsoidal Mercator projection with in this case default
parameters:
lon0=0; x0=0; y0=0; k0=1.0; WGS84 ellipsoid.
Apparently the 'Mike' code does a spherical Mercator, taking the semi-major
WGS84 axis as the radius.

Yes Thanks Oscar.
PROJ and cs2cs works fine.
I am mapping my images ( on mapserver) using it as WMS on Google Sky and 
the images match exactly.

I am trying to modify the merc.js code.

Thanks again

Antonio
