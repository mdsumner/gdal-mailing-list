Subject: [Proj] JVM Crash
Message-ID: <20060901123553.11780.qmail@web50306.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi All,

I am using Proj4 in my project. It works great!.

But for certain (invalid) transformations, the JVM
Crashes, like for example transforming EPSG:4269 to
EPSG:4326. This is a big problem as the whole
application just comes to halt.

Question: Is there a way around so that JVM doesn't
crash? Any way to send an error message and continue
with other stuff.

Thanks & Regards
Wadood

Message-ID: <6137433.post@talk.nabble.com>


I'm susing proj.dll to reproject wms raster from WGS84 to IGN-LAMBERT II E
with mapserver 

The first experience was under mapserver  for linux, and it worked fine.

Now, i made my tests on windows, and it seems not to work.

I 've checked my installation of proj, its working, but i don't have correct
re-projection
(woindows version of proj is 4.4.6)

Does anyone can confirm me this kind of problem under windows ?
Thanks

Ryan,

Based on some logic I have seen in my ISIS2 format driver, it would
seem that "SimpleCylindrical" in this context is the same as
Equidistant Cylindrical (aka Equiretangular or Plate Caree).

The corresponding projection string would be:

   +proj=eqc

It seems to be using a dataset specific central meridian of 354.6, so
we can add +lon_0=354.60611161722.  The indication is that the latitude
of true scale is zero, so I think we can leave this defaulted, or be
explicit and say +lat_ts=0.  I don't see any obvious setting for false
easting and northing, so perhaps the whole thing will be:

  +proj=eqc +lon_0=354.60611161722 +lat_ts=0 +a=3396190 +b=3376200

If we try:
proj -I +proj=eqc +lon_0=354.60611161722 +lat_ts=0 +a=3396190 +b=3376190 -f 
"%.10f"
-2549.695468358 -107601.7017923

We get:

-5.4369032875   -1.8153057930

We get sort of close to the expected value (if you add 360 to the X),
but it is still a bit off, at least in Y, which I think is because PROJ
only supports a spherical equidistant cylindrical projection.

Hopefully this is somewhat helpful though.

I can add:
and
lon = 354.562842; lat = -1.826054;
in the ellipsoidal case, using EPSG coordinate operation method 9823.
Close, but still no cigar.

I'm not 100% sure, but I think you can just pass in the WKT.  I don't think
you need to actually add the projection to the EPSG file.

Hi all,

I am trying to use cs2cs to go from Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area to
Lat Long. I get a problem when I try to use the WGS72 datum:

<cs2cs>:

program abnormally terminated

This works fine with WGS84 and NAD83. Does anyone have any ideas why
this happens?

Thanks,

Naiara.

Naiara,

There is no PROJ.4 recognise datum called WGS72 (use cs2cs -ld to see
show short list of built in datum names).  Instead you can just use the
WGS72 ellipsoid with no other datum modifiers.

eg.

+proj=latlong +ellps=WGS72

	Dear All Proj User & Developer,

I am a new user of Proj (and Geodesy system too).

I want to create cartesian coordinate in Nautical Miles unit,
which it center (0,0) on some point in Jakarta (Indonesia)
with coordinate in WGS84: 06d11m18.00sS  106d31m36.00sE

my questions are:
1. Can I use Proj to create my coordinate system above?
    I have read the manual, it should use +ellps=WGS84,
    but I don't know which +proj= to use?
2. If the coordinate center in above, what is the point
    (coordinate) of Medan, North Sumatera (Indonesia) with
    coordinate in WGS84: 03d30m17.47sN 098d36m27.58sE ?
3. Can I use Proj to calculate the distance between two
    points above? If it can't, can you give me another
    library to calculate the distance (and do coordinate
    conversion) in WGS84 coordinate with C/C++ binding?

sorry about my newbie question and
thanks for your kind attentions.

I cannot offer much PROJ help, but you could use the old PROJ function geod
to measure distances. Read the manual.
PROJ geod arrives (in my version) at a distance of 1386976.157 m =
748.907212 nm
A more accurate Vincenty function (not in PROJ) gives 1386976.161 m =
748.907214 nm.
Where the nautical mile is set to 1852 m.
If your coordinates have a precision of 0.01 arcseconds (= about 30 cm on
the globe), then no better accuracy in meters is needed than let's say 15
cm, so for coordinate differences as given, the PROJ geod function has an
acceptable accuracy.

Thanks for the information,
I have tried with geod (from latest version on Proj):
-----
minnie:~/proj4/bin oon$ ./geod +ellps=WGS84 <<EOF -I +units=m
> 6d11'18"S 106d31'36"E 3d30'17.47"N 98d36'27.58"E
> EOF
-39d35'58.123"  140d35'12.901"  1386976.157
-----

And the result equal with your answer.
For me, accuracy until 1m is no problem.

Now, i'll wait the answer for the cartesian coordinate question:
- If 6d11'18"S 106d31'36"E are center (0,0) of cartesian coordinate
   (with NM units), what is the coordinate of 3d30'17.47"N 98d36'27.58"E ?
   (or more precisely, with meter units)

thanks for the great software.. :)

Dear All Proj Users & Developers,

I've tried to convert from WGS84 to UTM (zone 47) with cs2cs:

minnie$ ./cs2cs -v +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=utm

point 3d30'17.47"N 98d36'27.58"E in WGS84 converted into UTM (zone47)
(X,Y,Z) = (456423.28,387405.51,0.00)

Then I want to reverse it back to WGS84.
I only replace the syntax of cs2cs, before "+to" replace with after
"+to".

and

PROJECTION
  "proj=ortho"

Thanks for the information.

btw, in the conversion from WGS84 to UTM, what is the meaning
of result value 0.00? is it "Z" coordinate (altitute)?

Previously, I think for reverse calculation from UTM to WGS84
I must include "Z" coordinate.

I found the answer about my previous coordinate transformation not

     Dear All,

I want to ask a question about distance calculation of two points in 
X,Y (UTM).
Is it ok if I get the distance of two points in X,Y (UTM) only with distance
calculation of cartesian coordinate (pythagoras method)?
The error getting larger (or getting huge) if I calculate the distance 
with the
points crossing the UTM zone. (I have tried for point with (1) different zone,
I don't know what will be happened if the points over more than 1 zone??)

Is it any other method to get distance calculation of cartesian 
coordinates X,Y (UTM), so the result of the calculation have accuracy 
like distance calculation
of WGS84?
(It's ok if the error about hundred meters)

thanks for your help..

You can obtain the distance deformation using proj with option -V. It 
gives the meridian and parallel scale factors, which are the same in the 
case of UTM, since it is a conformal projection.

The deformation increases with the distance to the central meridian. For 
a point on the equator, on the border of a standard UTM zone (i.e. 3 
degrees away from the central meridian) you have k=1.00098, which 
corresponds approx. to 1 metre per kilometer. For a point 4 degrees away 
it gets to 1.0021, i.e., approx. 2 meters per kilometer.

If you need to apply the scale factor to a long distance you must take 
into account that it is an integration problem. Anyway it is probably 
enough to take the scale fator at the midpoint of the line.

Oon:
 My sugestion:
  1) Convert to degrees
  2) Calculate distance with a  geodesic algorithm (Vicenthy, Puissant,
etc).

 You can't use this distance to irradiate new UTM points (distance + angle +
source point = second point) because UTM distance are "projected" (with
controled distortion). To make this you must project this distance with
local + ellipsoid parameters.

I Don't know about distance calculation with proj4 tools
There is manual methods to "zone transposition", but my sugestion is more
simple and generic than it.

When you talk about WGS84 you talk about "datum", not "projection". UTM is
used too with WGS84 datum.
You only calculate distance with cartesian formula using latlong coordinates
with you don't care about hundred meters of error but if you dont care about
probaly you are talking about much kilometers, than maybe you get thousand
meters of erros using this.

Distance (and azimuth) calculation should be done with a program computing the 
geodesic such as 'geod' or the NSG Vincente procedures.  For points within a 
few kilometers of each other the Cartesian coordinates of UTM or other 
appropriate conformal projection can be used where accuracies in the 
decimeters are acceptable.  For precision work, *never* consider cartographic 
Cartesian projection systems.

Calculation of distances across UTM zones is out of the question because each 
zone has its own origin.  Errors would be in the hundreds of kilometers.

Message-ID: <002301c6d753$0b519070$1818a8c0@net.midwestsurveys.com>

 

I am trying to convert a geographic coordinate north of 51 degrees latitude
from NAD83 to NAD 27

 

My command line options are:

 

>cs2cs +init=epsg:4269 +to +init:epsg:4267  -118 51

 

All I get for the answer is 

*	*  -0.000

 

 

However for a latitude below 50 I get an value displayed.

 

My specs on cs2cs are:

Rel. 4.4.8, 3 May 2004 

And is installed under Cygwin on XP professional

Subject: [Proj] Inclusion of California Teale Albers Projections??
Message-ID: <BAY118-F1357535812A9514DAE0167B7290@phx.gbl>

In working with applications based on UMN MapServer that rely on PROJ4, I 
have noticed that the distribution of EPSG packaged with PROJ4 does not seem 
contemporary with the lastest EPSG 6.11 release.  Specifically for my 
purposes, the California Teale Albers projections both NAD27 and NAD83 are 
not included in the version of EPSG packaged with PROJ4 despite their 
inclusion since version 6.6 of EPSG.  So I am wondering when the current 
EPSG database of projections will be folded into PROJ4.

I have certainly been able to add these projections manually to the EPSG 
file and I believe I have done so correctly, but in certain applications I 
have worked with I think the absence of these projections in PROJ4 may have 
caused a problem.  I cannot be certain of that.  Nonetheless, I am curious 
when a more current verison of EPSG will be incorporated into PROJ4.  
Thanks.

Folks,

I am surrounded by folks from the Czech Republic who have
finally forced me to fix the Krovak projection!

So,  finally, after many years it is done!

I have also prepared a beta of PROJ 4.5.0 with this change at:

  http://www.gdal.org/tmp/proj-4.5.0b1.tar.gz
or
  http://www.gdal.org/tmp/proj-4.5.0b1.zip

If there are no problems I will likely issue a final release in
a week or two.

Hello Frank,
Just a suggestion (probably unhelpful because I'm not proposing to help 
out with the work involved!) but I thought I should point it out:
Gerald supports this projection in libproj4, where it is identified by 
proj=kocc (for Krovak Oblique Conformal Conic) rather than proj=krovak. 
For long-term consistency (I know at some stage you intend to include 
libproj4 as some kind of "core" to PROJ.4) might it be a good idea to use 
his code instead of patching the "contributed" krovak code in PROJ.4?

I may as well offer my two cents also.

I do not particularly care what the projection is called but I would 
appreciate some communications as to using the 'kocc' designation so I could 
at least change my releases of libproj4 to conform with external usage.

Also, there was some earlier communications that maybe libproj4 would replace 
the old proj4 based code and recoding of existing applications might occur.  
I presume these ideas are dead and proj4 will remain the primary basis.

It is also somewhat disappointing that there is little if any communications 
about efforts modifying either proj4 or libproj4.  In the latter case I do 
not bother discussing my activities with libproj4 as I had no knowledge of 
anyone else hacking the system other than for private purposes.

Lacking any communications among developers is just going to lead to a 
mishmash of an odd assortment of [lib]proj4 releases with greater and greater 
incompatibility.

Subject: [Proj] What's wrong

First, sorry for my poor english.

I would like to use proj lib in a free french project.
This project soon has possibilities of transformation coordinates but 
restricting to French Ellipsoid, and I would like to offer larger 
possibilities. So I'm trying to test proj4 to see if I can use it in this 
project :
I find first that the documentation is not very accesible (references to 
documents that is nowhere, scripting conventions nowhere...etc) but there is 
sources.
I try to use cs2cs for converting coordinates but with no success :
here is an example :

C:\Documents and Settings\PANEL>"C:\Documents and 
Settings\PANEL\Bureau\projlib\
cs2cs.exe" +proj=lcc +ellps=clrk80 +x_0=600000 +y_0=200000 +k_0=0.99987742 
+lon_
0=2d20'14.025 +lat_0=46d48' +lat_1=45d53'56.108 +lat_2=47d41'45.652 +to 
+proj=lc

822056 62249
822074.85       362098.46 0.000
822056.39 62249.52 504.1
822075.24       362098.98 504.100

this conversion is wrong  822056.39 62249.52 504.1 must become 822075.25 
362135.78 504.1
I try with coma instead of decimal point : the result is wronger and 
different and there is no error reporting.

What's wrong ?

thanks for any help.

thanks!

I have seen that parameter k is not what I believe so I don't give it in parameter. so the conversion is good within the same ellipsoid, then I see that clrk80 is not the ellipsoid in use in France. this one seems to be a special clarke 80 ellipsoid because it has not the same definition parameters than this given in proj tables.
Do you know where we can find description of these parameters and their significations (without opening and decorticate the source code) ?
I suppose that +towgs is the datum shift between the used ellipsoid and WGS ellipsoid but why specify ? is it to superseed it ? 

Do you have so info of the parameters for the "Lambert 93" french projection ?

This library is very intersting and I believe that I'm going to open the source.

thanks for any help.

All French Lambert parameters, including ellipsoid dimensions and formulae
for the direct Lambert to Lambert zone transformations can be found in:

The problem is solved, thanks to a cartoweb user :
It comes from a wrong epsg file, wich is bad for lambert II extended.
the default proj4 epsg file is wrong

i join the fixed epsg file. http://www.nabble.com/user-files/235955/epsg

Message-ID: <D93CFEAA72FA764885CC1FDA94A1D89C01E02E32@WMRI000166.corp.wmdata.net>

Hello

 

I have used proj4/pj_transform for a while but I have to ask how you
suggest I should use the library. I want to transform a WGS84 coordinate
from 

Easting 16 59 59.97

Northing 62 11 59.96

to RT90 (+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=15.8062845294444 +k=1.00000561024
+x_0=1500064.274 +y_0=-667.711 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m) 

 

What functions should I use in proj4 to have maximum use of it?

 

I think pj_transform should be used. But is there functions to convert
lat/long from DMS to decimal degrees?

 

Regards

Johan

Gerald,

I'm not sure what the best solution to this is.  I applied the
krovak patch after years of "encouragement".  I wasn't aware there was
a distinct approach in libproj4.

Perhaps the Krovak user community could comment on how they would like
this handled?  I've no objection to using proj=kocc for this.

This is still my plan though my previous efforts to set a deadline
for myself have clearly not resulted in any progress.

It is generally my policy to advise folks who want new projections or
changes to existing projects to you, and then I try to backport the
changes as needed.

The truth is I am only spending a tiny amount of time on PROJ.4, mostly
apply provided patches, and updating EPSG database translations.

Hi,

there is no objections (as I know from the Czech mailing list) to use
'kocc' projection identifier.

Proposal: would be possible to keep 'krovak' as an alternative
projection name due to backward compatibility?

In any case, big thanks to Frank for applying the patch!:-)

Best regards, Martin

Frank,
We did add the code. But when we attempt to reproject the
geotiff in the projection with the code through the minnesota mapserver,
we receive an error inferring the code is an invalid SRS. Any thoughts...

Vincent,

Could you capture the exact error text and send it to me?

I am sorry on two accounts: 1) my DSL modem died last Monday and it took 
Verizon until Thursday morning to diagnose the problem which forced my being 
late in commenting on this email and 2) I had a senior moment when making my 
original complaint about the Krovak projection name. Â It *is* called *kocc* in 
libproj4. Â It has been too long since I last worked on Krovak and resulted in 
the designated name slipping my mind. Â Sorry.

Note: this original reply only went to Warmerdam and not the mail list

Subject: [Proj] Left- or right-handed rotation convention: which is which?
Message-ID: <24790336.1159633272325.JavaMail.tomcat@pne-ps4-sn2>

Hello,
I am confused. 
At my work, I have tried to document the rotation convention used by 
our software for seven-parameter datum shifts.  Since it was originally 
based on publications from the Swedish Land Survey, it uses the 
rotation convention of USA/Sweden/Luxembourg/Australia, as opposed to 
the opposite European/IAG/ISO19111 convention.  

Following http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.
uk/oswebsite/gps/information/coordinatesystemsinfo/guidecontents/guide6.
html, I have called the USA-etc. rotation convention the left-handed 
one.  The British Ordnance Survey writes, about the European 
convention, 

"Beware that two opposite conventions are in use regarding the 
rotation parameters of the Helmert transformation. Equation (3) uses 
the right-hand-rule rotation convention: with the positive end of an 
axis pointing towards you, a positive rotation about that axis is 
anticlockwise. A way to remember this is: if your right-hand thumb in 
hitch-hiking pose is the positive end of an axis, the curl of the 
fingers indicates positive rotation."

But now, I have noticed that the Grids and Datums columns of Cliff 
Mugnier (http://www.asprs.org/resources/grids), at least the columns on 
Finland and the Netherlands, say that it is the American convention 
that is right-handed, and the European one is left-handed.  

Well, I suppose that everyone wants to be right, and no one wants to 
be left!  But are there any simple, unambiguous names for these two 
conventions?  Would the following be correct:
  American convention = "coordinate frame rotation";
  European convention = "position vector transformation".

Is the "Bursa-Wolf" transformation exactly the same as the European 
convention, whereas a "Helmert" transformation is a more general term, 
and can refer to either rotation convention (and, indeed, this kind of 
transformation in n-dimensional Euclidean space, for any n)?

Grateful for comments,
