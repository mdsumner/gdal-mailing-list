Subject: [Proj] Difference in Orthographic projection between Proj4 and
 Global Mapper
Message-ID: <1467881476793-5275097.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello List, 

I have encountered an issue where I am getting a mismatch between Global
Mapper and Proj4 results for orthographic projection.

I have contacted GM and dug around online so I know that they use GCTP for
their orthographic implementation and that there are issues listed here
about the difference in the results -
http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/random_issues.html#orthographic




Our test lat and lon origins were lat=52, lon=-3

This gives us the following definitions from each system, 

Here is the proj4 string: 

+proj=ortho +lat_0=52 +lon_0=-3 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs 


Here is the WKT representation exported from Global Mapper: 

PROJCS["Orthographic",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS84",SPHEROID["WGS84",6378137,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Orthographic"],PARAMETER["longitude_of_center",-3],PARAMETER["latitude_of_center",52],PARAMETER["false_easting",0],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

Next we used a test point of lat=52.1, lon=-3.1

Our results were:
 
                     GM                            Proj4 
    
                     11,117.97, -6826.7   11136.65 -6838.1881 


I also tested proj4 by swapping +ellps=WGS84 for +ellps=sphere the results
were closer but not exact, 

sphere                             11124.1789, -6830.5331

Can anyone give me any insight into what is happening here and if I can
force proj4 to match Global Mapper (GCTP)? (I know there is reference to
that on the remotesensing.org random issues page, but how do I 'override'
the radius in proj to get the same answer?) 

Thanks in advance, 

Ills

Does this solve the problem? (taking the radius from the remotesensing page
you referred to):

$ echo -3.1 52.1 | proj +proj=ortho +lat_0=52 +lon_0=-3 +x_0=0 +y_0=0
+a=6370997 +f=0 +units=m +no_defs

Output:

-6830.53        11124.18

No, it is the same as using +ellps=sphere – as was already tried. By doing a bit of manual bisection on the radius I came up with the following that more or less matches the results from GM:

> echo -3.1 52.1 | proj +proj=ortho +lat_0=52 +lon_0=-3 +a=6367440 +units=m +no_defs
-6826.72        11117.97

I have no idea if that works for other coordinates though! Probably not…

6367440 is approximately the average (3 meters off) of the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the WGS84 ellipsoid, which is of absolutely no significance geodetically.  It's not the radius of the sphere with the same volume or the same area as WGS84.  It's just an uniformed guess of an orthographic radius.  Maybe Blue Marble haven't yet gotten around to cleaning up Global Mapper's cartography, so I'd hesitate forcing proj4 to match GM.  Anyway, it's time to use an ellipsoidal orthographic instead, which you can read about here:

Thanks for all the replies and suggestions so far, 

After more testing, which shows that we can get identical results in proj4
as GlobalMapper using a spheroid radius of 6367444.66m. This is the midpoint
of the standard WGS84 semi-major (6378137) and semi-minor axes radii
(6356752.3).
 
This seems to be different from the normal mean earth radius used by GCTP
(6370997).

Waiting on a a reply from Blue Marble, loathing to think about all the data
which could now be wrong and again thanking you all for your time. 

Ills

Hi Huw,

Given ellipsoidal parameters there are many spherical radii from which to choose.  Wikipedia gives a good summary:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius

But where does GCTP’s 6370997 come from?  It’s close to some radii for WGS84, but no cigar.  Is it just a convention?  Anyone know?

Of course, if you’re mapping on a sphere “closeness” shouldn’t really matter very much.  Consistency should matter more, and, in that sense, a conventional radius would be useful.

The radius of 6370997 is the integer part of the authalic radius of the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid.
The calculated value would be around 6370997.24063266 m.

Noel,

Which then begs the question, why not use the Authalic Latitude function for your spherical equal area projection …

That’s what Pearson tried to do when proposed the idea for the old Bonne projection applications in reproducing 19th century graticules.
Not mathematically equivalent, but that’s what he proposed.

Noel,

By the way, … GCTP was originally written in FORTRAN77 by Dr. Atef Elassal (a Photogrammetrist) who passed away earlier this year.  His obituary was published in PE&RS.  Everything in GCTP was kosher John P. Snyder, since both worked at the time for USGS Reston.

Noel,

Which then begs the question, why not use the Authalic Latitude function for your spherical equal area projection …

That’s what Pearson tried to do when proposed the idea for the old Bonne projection applications in reproducing 19th century graticules.
Not mathematically equivalent, but that’s what he proposed.

The radius of 6370997 is the integer part of the authalic radius of the Clarke 1866 ellipsoid.
The calculated value would be around 6370997.24063266 m.

Hi Huw,

Given ellipsoidal parameters there are many spherical radii from which to choose.  Wikipedia gives a good summary:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius

But where does GCTP’s 6370997 come from?  It’s close to some radii for WGS84, but no cigar.  Is it just a convention?  Anyone know?

Of course, if you’re mapping on a sphere “closeness” shouldn’t really matter very much.  Consistency should matter more, and, in that sense, a conventional radius would be useful.

It's the authalic radius (rounded) of Clarke 1866. A more precise value is 6370997.24 m.

Hello,

I can confirm the value of the radius used by GCTP if it helps any.

The typos, yes. Unfortunate. Even more unfortunate is the fictitious integral given for the length of a geodesic. This was repeated by Fenna in A Compendium of Map Projections. Now we’ll never be rid of it.

Hi Michael,

There wasn't, but I don't see why we shouldn't have it in proj.4. The projection is quite simple so I have already implemented it. So far it exists as a pull request on GitHub https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/400. I'll wait a few days before I merge it with master. It would be great if you could test it and check if it works as expected.
