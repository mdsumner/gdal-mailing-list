Hi folks,

I am a new user and I am trying to figure out how to use Invproj. Can
anyone give me one example? I am trying something like

invproj +proj=utm +datum=WGS84 281392 2056212

to get Lat Long coordinates from my UTM coordinates. But I get the error #2.

Thanks a lot!

Naiara.

Coordinates are read from standard input, not the command line.  Also,
you should specify +ellips instead of +datum since proj/invproj don't
know about datums.  Also, UTM generally has a zone and a south flag if
necessary (proj doesn't know about/use grid zones like 10T).  

$> proj -I +proj=utm +ellips=nad83 +zone=11

Perhaps try one of the following:

echo "281392 2056212" | proj -I +proj=utm +ellps=WGS84 +zone=23

Or:

proj -I +proj=utm +ellps=WGS84 +zone=23  some_file_name.txt


You should change the value of +zone to the utm zone that is
relevant to your coordinates. I just put 23 in as an example.

Hey yall,

Been a while since I've posed a question so thought I'd reer the ugly 
head again.

What I am tryin to do is start by using a SHP file with close to 15000 
points. The shp file is suposedly nad27. for each point I would like to 
extract the nad27 co-ordinates of each site, reproject them to nad83, 
and DDMMSS and DDMM.SS to an output file.

the final goal is to have a CSV file that can be imported into a silly 
proprietary dabase. the CSV would look something like

SITEID, NAD27, NAD83, LAT/LONG, DDMMSS, DDMM.SS

I think that's right... projections still confuse this geographer from 
time to time.

I'm not sure if maybe you'd need a NAD27E, NAD27W format.

any ideas? Or resources towards examples of this procedure?

cheers

Hello,

Can this actually be done with proj...?(Didn't think so)
SHP files are ~proprietary to arcview GIS. There is a
format spec available on the web.

I have an arcview script for dumping coordinates
from SHP files to ascii text, if that helps. I believe it also
dumps one attribute as well, allowing you to link
the geographic data with the data in the accompanying
DBF file. In any case you could modify the script to
dump what ever you want.

I seem to remember reprojecting SHP files before. PROJ was even creating

I think you might be thinking of a contrib program distributed with
Frank's Shapelib.  It depends on proj.4 libraries (and associated datum
files).
See "shpproj.c" in the contrib directory:

Hello,

Interesting. I wasn't aware of the SHP capabilities.
I guess they must not be covered in the docs...
I just tried proj on a known shp file and just got
garbage. Let me know if you find the proper instructions
for this.

Yes, the script I have is written in avenue.
You can find it online by googling

arcview shp2ascii

I was writing some C++ source code to
extract SHP/SHX/DBF files into  various other
formats as well, but that's far from
finished.

I think also that grass gis can import SHP
files and then export to ascii formats.
Grass is open source.
Unfortunately I don't have grass on this
particular machine so I can't verify.

Let me know if you want the script. It's
in the public domain so I can post it.

Peter

GRASS can do it sure (v.in.ogr, v.proj, v.out.ascii, and
v.out.ascii.db), but GRASS is just using OGR which comes with GDAL, a
half-sister product of PROJ, & you can just use OGR directly.

http://www.gdal.org/ogr/


I believe ogr2ogr is the utility you want. (use the -t_srs option)

Dave,

My suggestion would be to write a python script to do this
using OGR to read the shapefile, and the OGR wrappers
for GDAL to handle the datum shift.  Of course, many other
possible solutions exist too but you need to put something 
together for reading the shapefiles, and something for doing
the datum shift.  OGR is convenient in having both.

If you look at:
 http://www.gdal.org/srctree/pymod/samples

you should find a "tolatlong.py" script that gives a brief
idea how to deal with coordinate transformations, and a
assemblepoly.py script that demonstrates reading features
with OGR. 

Quite a bit of work would have to be done to put it all 
together of course.  The following tutorials might also
be of help.

  http://www.gdal.org/ogr/osr_tutorial.html
  http://www.gdal.org/ogr/ogr_apitut.html

You can use the FWTools build if you need a package
with Python, OGR and PROJ.4 and nicely pre-setup 
(win32 or linux).

Luca, 

Your are missing the prime meridian specification.  Your ROME40
should have +pm=rome indicating the prime meridian at rome. 

eg. 
cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=latlong +pm=rome
+ellps=intl +towgs84=-104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68
12d21'17.6455"E 43d07'08.7045"N
0d5'50.03"W     43d7'6.341"N -45.663

Note that the longitude west of rome is equivelent to a negative 
longtidue east of rome in your expected result.

Hi frank and thank you very much for the help...
Just for knowing, is it possibile to have with E longitude?

Thx

all.

Thanks for the repsonses.

Ok, so after treading water for a few years in the open source world I'm 
in over my head (again).

BASH scripting is painful enough. I could only imagine what python would 
be like.

With regret of having to use ARCview could the following work

1. Open shape in arcview (squirm)
2. run X,Y extension on SHP. Unless there is a  UTM extension in existance.
        If the shape is projected in nad27 can I assume the x,y collumns 
would be UTM north/east?
3. Dump DB file as CSV
       Could I keep the CSV with all 15000 points or should I create 
seprate file for each point at this stage?
4. THEN run proj for transformation of the two (x,y) columns in the CSV 
file to produce my successive collumns.
       If I create a seprate file for each of the 15000 points a BASH 
script could run PROJ in a FOR EACH loop

How feasible does this sound? The ideal would be to keep all 15000 
points in one file along the work flow.

Hamish,

Can OGR be used directly to dump SHP points to a CSV?


Thanks again for all the input.

Dave,

No offence, but at some point you will likely need to master some
scripting language to give yourself flexability in doing GIS tasks
with a mixture of software.

There is no reason not to keep all the points in one file.  I don't
know anything about the "X,Y' extension so I don't can't address
that.

I am not sure how you are going to make proj ignore your siteid
column and only use the following columns.  Perhaps you will need
to use the cut and paste programs to split up and patch together 
columns. 

> Can OGR be used directly to dump SHP points to a CSV?

OGR can write directly to CVS but does not place the geometry
in the CSV file (or at least not as separate columns).

Hello Dave,

I just remembered... I once wrote a C utility to read portions of 
shapefiles and draw pictures from them in any projection known to PROJ 
(optionally transforming to/from NAD27/83). See the documentation and 
links at
    http://tull.mit.edu/orthoserver/vector/

Perhaps you can reuse portions of that code and save yourself some time. 
(I recall we had to rethink the projection logic at least once.) It uses 
old versions of Frank Warmerdam's shapelib, PROJ of course, and Tom 
Boutell's libgd (which I presume you wouldn't need).

Of course, you could also rip out and reuse portions of MapServer.

Message-ID: <9748CA0A33163743BCD1B77F5614094A41D777@agencyx.ad.resources.ca.gov>

Hi all,

I've heard that a new version of the EPSG dataset, version 6.8, will be
released very shortly. Will a new version of the Proj.4 library (and/or
associated epsg file) released when the new EPSG dataset is released? 

The reason I ask is that two new projections, the California Teale
Albers projections (in NAD27 and NAD83), which are widely used in
datasets for the state of California, will soon be added in the next
version of the EPSG dataset, so that WMS compliant map clients and
servers, such as the University of Minnesota Mapserver, will soon be
able to recognize these two new projections, among others.

Message-ID: <20050921140438.3059810A74C@mixing.qc.dfo.ca>

Hi,

I forgot to report a minor bug when it was submitted to the Debian bug
tracking system...  Here it is:

 http://bugs.debian.org/323305

BTW, all bugs reported are visible here:

 http://bugs.debian.org/proj

I'm CC'ing this message to the Debian BTS.  You may do that as well if
you reply.

Here's the bug:

-
Funny inputs result in wrong output

pavel at amd:~$ echo '90N 14E 90S 18E' | geod +ellps=WGS84 -I +units=km

results in 

-2147483648d-2147483648'nan"    -2147483648d-2147483648'nan"    nan

...which looks like a bug to me. I'd expect something close to
20000km...

pavel at amd:~$ echo '89N 14E 89S 99E' | geod +ellps=WGS84 -I +units=km
137d29'31.508"  -42d30'28.492"  19839.241

..which seems okay but

pavel at amd:~$ echo '90N 14E 89S 18E' | geod +ellps=WGS84 -I +units=km
4d      180d    111.694

...which is way too short. Going from north pole close to south pole
should take more than 112 km.

Ok, maybe core of the problem is that it does not check for invalid
inputs, and 90N is invalid input for some reason? 91N definitely
should be invalid ;-)

pavel at amd:~$ echo '91N 14E 89S 99E' | geod +ellps=WGS84 -I +units=km
132d29'44.351"  -132d29'44.351" 150.914

Hello,

I often have maps with unknown projection information but printed lat/lon 
grids. Or papermaps, which have strong deformations so that after scanning the 
projection does not fit anymore.
Is there a way in proj to calculate x-y/lat-lon by defining a couple of known 
referencepoints ?

Regards,
Thomas Flemming

Thomas,

It seems like what you would want is a rubber sheeting transform
of some kind based on a bunch of reference points.  Two reference
points wouldn't give you much information.  PROJ.4 does not
address this issue.  I do have such a capability in GDAL -
underlying transformations based on reference points and a way
of applying it to resample rasters.

I would recommend an eight-parameter projective transformation based on
four points of a graticule.  The panelling of such is identical to the old
graphical technique employed by cartographers of 20 years ago.

Puh, this sounds good, btu I think GDAL is too big for me to understand for 
this single task.

I have this eight-parameter projective transformation already in my software, 
but it does not work good for maps which are stitched from many scanned papermaps.
In this case I need much more control points.

Subject: [Proj] Rectification of maps
Message-ID: <41CC46B3925E384BA64B1FB5041C38FA1938AD@max.novacell.com>

Might I suggest globalmapper, available from
http://www.globalmapper.com.  We have found this software to be
excellent for rectification of scanned maps, as it has a wide variety of
projections available as well as a GUI interface to apply control
points.  It has a rubber sheeting transform available and the results
are better than other, substantially more expensive software we've used
for the same purpose.
 
The development team is responsive and flexible.

Hello, 



It seems like what you would want is a rubber sheeting transform 
of some kind based on a bunch of reference points.  Two reference 
points wouldn't give you much information.  PROJ.4 does not 
address this issue.  I do have such a capability in GDAL - 
underlying transformations based on reference points and a way 
of applying it to resample rasters. 


Puh, this sounds good, btu I think GDAL is too big for me to understand
for this single task. 






I would recommend an eight-parameter projective transformation based on 
four points of a graticule.  The panelling of such is identical to the
old 
graphical technique employed by cartographers of 20 years ago. 


I have this eight-parameter projective transformation already in my
software, but it does not work good for maps which are stitched from
many scanned papermaps. 
In this case I need much more control points. 


Best regards, 
Thomas
