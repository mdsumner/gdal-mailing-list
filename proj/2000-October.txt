Message-ID: <00049D7DD868D4118EBA00A0C9C3C227020B71@msgmarbio01.bio.dfo.ca>

Hi,

I hope this is not too off-topic... I'm using the proj4 library in my own
application (on a win95 pc), and while it appears to work relatively well,
I'm limited by my lack of understanding.

In particular, I don't understand the significance of the Radius Parameters
as described in Evenden's reports. While the effect of choosing a given
radius parameter is documented (e.g. R_A), what I'm lacking the rational for
choosing one of these parameters (or not), when choosing a given projection.


Is the choice merely up to the user (and therefore likely selected on some
particular minimization of distortion), or are there well-known common
practices (e.g. for a MERC projection of the Cdn east coast always use R_A).

Thanks in advance,

Radius parameters such as R_A only apply when using projections in their
spherical form.  R_A is probably the most useful as it give the radius of a
sphere with the same surface area as the ellipsoid selected.  Also, it is
necessary
to select a ellipsoid when using R_A even though the projection is in the
spherical mode.

Snyder often uses a radius in his manual that is the R_A for Clarke 1866.

The other radius parameters have limited usage for sophisticates. ;-)

Can anyone explain why PROJ in the Goode projection uses a different
latitude breakpoint for switching from Sinusoidal to Mollweide projection.
Other sources (e.g.  http://edcdaac.usgs.gov/1KM/goodesarticle.html ,
http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/software/misc/gihll2ls.c ) have the
breakpoint at 40 44' 11.8 degrees (0.71098798993 rad).

The PROJ function uses 0.71093078197902358062 (exactly 40 44'
degrees), but then adds/substracts a correction term (Y_COR) to the
output.

Is the result the same? My limited math mind suggests it's not, though the
difference may not be significant on global maps.

I noted this when I was looking at implementing interrupted goode
homolosine in PROJ. Interrupted or not, the breakpoint should be at 40
44' 11.8, no?

Ref. from goode.c:

#define Y_COR		0.05280
#define PHI_LIM	.71093078197902358062
FORWARD(s_forward); /* spheroid */
	if (fabs(lp.phi) <= PHI_LIM)
		xy = P->sinu->fwd(lp, P->sinu);
	else {
		xy = P->moll->fwd(lp, P->moll);
		xy.y -= lp.phi >= 0.0 ? Y_COR : -Y_COR;
	}
	return (xy);
}

The seam between Sinusoidal and Mollweide is where the scales are equal
I suppose the 40:44:11.8 is a little more accurate than the 40:44 that the
original sources from Snyder but who cares.  The typical scale of Goode
is so small that 11.8" ain't goin to make much difference!

The Y correction is because the two projections do not produce the same
y value at 40:44.  Equitorial-Polar aspect varies between
pseudocylindricals.

Beware, there are at least two versions of Goode's interuptions.  Also,
there are
gores that duplicate regions.  Almost impossible to make an automatic
version.
Take a look at one of Goode's atlases.

Interrupted projections are a nightmare to automate!

Unless someone uses a Goode map to program a cruise missile near 40N and
hits the wrong emb^H^H^Htarget ;-)

So if PH.LIM is changed to 40 44 11.8 then the correction value should
change too?

I get it. I was just thinking on using some of the USGS global/regional
Goode maps as a source for a GRASS5 location in the same projection (which
would require a PROJ goode_i projection, since GRASS relies on PROJ). A
mask (in GRASS) to blacken the duplicated regions would solve part of the
problems, but then it would be a GRASS-specific solution.

Defining interrupted projections within PROJ is *not* in the spirit of
PROJ's
purpose nor scope.  PROJ was designed to provide a computation system
to solve the mathematical aspects of cartographic projections.

Doing an interrupted projection is a graphical problem involving the
windowing
and control of where elements are placed in a complex. manner.
The mathematical part (PROJ's work) is secondary and relatively trivial.

In addition, interrupted projections often suffer from a variety of forms
and individual interpretation of the atlas builder.  For example, Goode has
a land weighted version (most common) *and* an oceanic weighted
version.

To add interruption methods into the PROJ system destroys its modularity
and confuses graphical operations with the mathematic definitions.  PROJ is
*not* a map making system, it is a system to compute the transformations
between geographic and Cartesian space.

Interestingly, when I made interrupted maps, having the interruptions inside
the
projections would have made designing the mapping software almost
impossible.
The regional outlines had to be available for the clipping procedures so
there was
no advantage to include them in the projection.

Lastly, to answer the question posed, yes a new Y offset has to be computed
if the boundary latitude is changed.
