Subject: [Proj] EPSG 8.2 Upgrade
Message-ID: <CA+YzLBci4sJ+=n5qm=409VtvEL1UKneeePMmiAk4Ke-Q4w3bGw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I have upgraded libgeotiff, GDAL and PROJ.4 trunk's with
the EPSG 8.2 database definitions.   I have come to the
conclusion that the EPSG Postgresql .sql files are distributed
in WIN1252 encoding, not LATIN1, and so some special
characters - mostly in comments - should be translated better.

Let me know if you see problems or have questions.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <52529AB4.7070808@gwi.net>

Hello people of the list,

I'm interested in learning more about PROJ.4, how to use itand I have 
signed up to this email list.; however, I am not a programmer.

Here's one for the FAQ <http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/FAQ> page:

    Is there a remedial /_Where do I begin?_/ page for surveyors?

Kind regards,

Kelly

*PROJ 4.4.6 WIN32 Binary Release*

This is a package of pre-built binaries for PROJ 4.4.6 for Win32 systems 
dating from March 2003.

Is this the current build?

Hi kelly

have a look at the Osgeo4w bundle install (http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/)
.
It has a more recent pre-built binaries for PROJ4.

Dear list,

very new to this, I have a question that might be very easily answered by
someone familiar with cs2cs.
I have the following Lat/Lon coordinates pair (few thousand pairs actually)

262555.03S 1261004.91E
261455.02S 1261504.90E
262555.03S 1261004.91E
265555.04S 1261404.93E

with datum/spheroid/etc description as below. Zone 51, Australia.

H2302 GRID COORDINATES AT ORIGIN       0.00W       0.00S


I need to transform these to XY coordinates.

Using

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to  +proj=utm +zone=51 +datum=WGS84 -r
<<EOF
26d25'55" 126d15'04"
EOF

I get

824270.31       2927618.51 0.00


X looks OK, but for the Y values I am expecting values around 6,9xx,xxx ~
7,0xx,xxx

Would you please:

1. Point me towards using the command properly
2. Suggest best format of my text file for batch conversion. Can easily
manipulate/separate columns, would prefer not to have to inset d, ', "
symbols, but would be able if necessary.

Thanks for your help,
regards,
Szilard

Hi Szilard

concerning you first point "using the command properly"
a) first you have to use input telling if your coordinate are north/south
and east/west. so transform
26d25'55" 126d15'04"  to 26d25'55"S 126d15'04"E
b) you need to specifie that you want UTM51 south and not utm51 north by
using the +south parameters
spatialreference.org is a very good ressource for finding this kind of
stuff : http://www.spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/32751/
cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to  +proj=utm +zone=51 +datum=WGS84 -r

Re

sorry send my previous message before ending

so you have to tranform your cs2cs command from
cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to  +proj=utm +zone=51 +datum=WGS84 -r
to
cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to  +proj=utm +zone=51 +south
+datum=WGS84 -r
or using epsg dictionnary
cs2cs +init="EPSG:4326" +to  +init="EPSG:32751" -r

Dear List,

I would like some clarifications/assurances regarding my usage of cs2cs.
The task is to convert UTM Zone 53 XY coordinates into Lat/Lon coordinates,
keeping datum.

I am using:

*cs2cs -W2 +proj=utm +zone=53 +south  +datum=WGS84 +to  +proj=latlong
+datum=WGS84
669734.6 7607027.2
136d38'24.07"E  21d37'54.60"S 0.000*

getting a result that seems fine.

However, the following issues arise:

1. My input data is on the GDA94 datum. When I try  +datum=GDA94 (or GDA),
I get
*<cs2cs>:
projection initialization failure
cause: unknown elliptical parameter name.*

Am I safe using WGS84, since the difference between these 2 datums is less
than 1 m? (http://www.geoproject.com.au/gda.faq.html).

2. I have heaps of other parameters of my input data - as below - should
any of these be incorporated in my command,
or datum and zone are enough?

Datum GDA94
Spheroid GRS80
Semi-major axis
Projection UTM MGA Z 53
Central meridian 135 E
False E/N, Scale factor 0.9996 etc

Thank you for your help.
regards,
Szilard

For this task, you don't really need cs2cs. proj -I or invproj can be 
used. See below.

proj -ld (or cs2cs -ld) gives the list of known datums. GDA or GDA94 are 
not mentioned there. However, you do not have to worry, as you anyway 
want to keep the datum.

I would simply use: invproj -W2 +proj=utm +zone=53 +south +ellps=GRS80

Other parameters like central meridian, scale factor, etc. do not need 
to be specified explicitly. They are implied through +proj=utm and +zone=53.

Thank you Hermann,

just did a quick comparison of the results after using invproj, seem to
have the same result.

Hi,

Is there a way to find out the bounds of a given projection?
Let’s say I have a given projection (UTM) and have a point (supposedly in
the same utm) but I want to find out if that point is within the bounds of
the projection.

Let me know if you have ideas.

Best regards,

Tamas

Coordinate systems do not generally have defined bounds although there may
be laws that govern where a given coordinate system is to be used. In
theory, you could represent any place on the earth in any coordinate system.

Regarding UTM, a given coordinate pair would be valid in any of the 60 UTM
zones since false x and y are the same in every zone. Only the longitude
origin changes between zones.

I don't know if this would be helpful in your case, but an interesting tool
that was introduced at FOSS4G-NA this year can help make educated guesses
about coordinate systems: http://projfinder.com/

Actually, coordinate systems used by military forces have traditionally published bounds.  For instance, the Maroc Nord and Maroc Sud zones have an eastern limit to their Grids that are defined by the 448,000 meter Easting (X) coordinate of the North African ellipsoidal Bonne projection.  The intersection of this Grid limit with the graticule was a graphical simplicity but a computational nightmare until the paper of Karl Rinner was used at Army Map Service.  In the 1930’s, Professor Rinner published a paper (in German) detailing his development of the formulae for the ellipsoidal Bonne projection in series form.  AMS developed a reversion of his series, and computational algorithms were developed for the North African Bonne in Morocco among other places.  Most of the battle zones of WWII were in Grid Zones that had published boundaries, and some of the boundaries famously employed ellipsoidal loxodromes.



With regard to the UTM, the traditional bounds are three degrees on either side of the central meridian.  At higher latitudes there are some noted exceptions, including the "zipper" in Northern Scandanavia with respect to the Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) which is based on the UTM.



Not common nowadays, bounds still exist for dozens of legacy Grid Systems.



People should read more of my publications ...

Coordinate systems do not generally have defined bounds although there may be laws that govern where a given coordinate system is to be used. In theory, you could represent any place on the earth in any coordinate system.

Regarding UTM, a given coordinate pair would be valid in any of the 60 UTM zones since false x and y are the same in every zone. Only the longitude origin changes between zones.

I don't know if this would be helpful in your case, but an interesting tool that was introduced at FOSS4G-NA this year can help make educated guesses about coordinate systems: http://projfinder.com/

Hi,

Let’s say I have a given projection (UTM) and have a point (supposedly in the same utm) but I want to find out if that point is within the bounds of the projection.

Let me know if you have ideas.

Best regards,

Tamas

Hi Tamas,

If you have questions about the bounds for a specific coordinate system,
and know its EPSG code, you can use the EPSG registry to look up its "Area
of Use."

Hope that helps,

carl

How would you represent a point at 52S 170W in ETRS89/LAEA Europe, also 
known EPSG:3035? 52S 170W happens to be the antipodal point of the 
coordinate system's projection centre.

It is my experience that defined descriptive bounds tagged to coordinate
systems has caused great confusion in GIS circles - especially for "legacy"
systems.
*NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_2*  for example, tagged for use in the Aleutians
still is being used today with modern positional tools (like GPS).
Over the years, ESRI has refined their use of these and we welcome these
changes.  See the red text on this page.

The original question in this "thread" was with respect to projection bounds, and specifically UTM:



"Is there a way to find out the bounds of a given projection?
Let’s say I have a given projection (UTM) and have a point (supposedly in the same utm) but I want to find out if that point is within the bounds of the projection."



 I see this has devolved to a discussion on the variation of datum shifts with respect to geographic areas.  The "new" topic needs to recognize datum shifts accomplished with MREs, NTv2, NadCon, 3-parameter rigid-body geocentric shifts and 7-parameter Molodensky and Bursa-Wolf shifts.



Each tool works within its intended design area, but DOES require some basic knowledge of geodesy for proper implementation.  If you're going to teach GIS, you need to first teach the basics of the geodetic foundation of the system.

Subject: [Proj] 4.9.0 Beta2 Available
Message-ID: <CA+YzLBcAbNd7brqpCrGGDXBF9sOaBiXrYhFB=SFwEggoKPSMLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

With a wee prompt from Howard, I have reawakened the PROJ 4.9.0 release
train after a few months asleep.  I have gone through the open bugs,
dealing with a few, and prepared a new beta release.

If there are no serious issues, and if Howard prompts me again, I'd like to
do a final 4.9.0 release within a week or so.

  http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.0b2.tar.gz
  http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.0b2.zip

The most noteworthy change since the last beta is updating to EPSG 8.2.

Best regards,
