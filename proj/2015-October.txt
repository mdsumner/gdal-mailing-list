Last year, NGA updated its recommendations on the algorithms to use for
UTM from tmerc to etmerc (in proj.4's terminology). I recommend that
proj.4 follow suit, i.e., move the definition of utm from PJ_tmerc.c to
proj_etmerc.c.

I took a look at doing this and my initial attempts were stymied by a
lack of knowledge about the macros that proj.4 uses to construct code.
So it would be better is someone else could tackle this. Any
volunteers? I'd be happy to help in checking out the result.

Background:

The NGA paper is "The Universal Grids and the Transverse Mercator and
Polar Stereographic Map Projections"

http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/NGA_SIG_0012_2_0_0_UTMUPS/NGA.SIG.0012_2.0.0_UTMUPS.pdf

The error in tmerc is less then 1 mm if you stick to the UTM zones.
However there's interest in extending UTM well beyond the 6 degree
zones. For example the point 83N 0E is less than 400km from the center
of zone 35n. So the scale of 35n UTM projection 1.0011 at this point.
However

echo 0 83 | cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=utm +zone=35 
+datum=WGS84 -f %.6f
echo 0 83 | cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc 
+datum=WGS84 +k=0.9996 +lon_0=27 +x_0=500000 -f %.6f

both return 145723.827486, 9300924.850170, while

echo 0 83 | cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=etmerc 
+datum=WGS84 +k=0.9996 +lon_0=27 +x_0=500000 -f %.6f

returns the correct result 145723.870553, 9300924.845226; so tmerc and
utm are in error by about 43 mm.

Charles,

Thanks for the contribution. Hearing no feedback, I have merged your pull request implementing this change. Please see https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/323 for more information.

This update will be provided as part of the upcoming 4.9.3 release[1] . I am shooting for an early 2016 target for that release unless something comes up to hurry things up.

Howard

This change has now been made to the master branch of the source.  The
"utm projection" now follows the NGA recommendation and uses etmerc
instead of tmerc (which is less accurate).  You can expect small
(typically < 1mm, except at high latitudes) changes in the results for
the utm projection.

While correcting wrong parameterisations is good, here we are doing what the
mooted metacrs definitions were trying to avoid, that is altering in-place
code without user-facing versioning. Different versions (by commit hashes
now) of the underlying code will now give different answers, so re-running
an analysis with the same data and apparently the same code in software
linking to proj will give different answers, without the user necessarily
being able to re-instate the earlier relationship. It would be great to bear
in mind the fact that research does need to be reproducible (data from times
before this correction was known don't need to be obliged to use it). I
guess we have to assume that users really read commit logs and NEWS files.

I have a different understanding of the process from you.

I made the change to the source code repository in git.  This is not
typically what end users or downstream packagers use.  They will pick up
an official release.  The change I just made will therefore be
incorporated into release 4.9.3.  At that time there will be an
announcement with the changes (including this one) described.  There's
will only be one version 4.9.3 and specifying that you linked with this
version will be sufficient to specify the code you used.

This is how proj.4 and most other open source projects are usually
updated.

I hope this addresses your concerns.

Roger,

I'm not in the business of reproducible research but I guess that if you want 
things to be perfectly reproducible you'd have to specify all the environment: 
exact software versions, probably with their compilation options and versions 
of their dependencies, OS version, and possibly hardware that was used.

Yes, that's why I voiced it. The understanding of process in software 
development (not only open source) and in reproducible research does 
differ. I mentioned the same concern on:

https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-sig-geo/2015-August/023204.html

to which Howard replied:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/metacrs/2015-August/000848.html

Software development seems to focus on replacing "less correct" 
computations with "more correct; more attractive; more efficient", while 
reproducible research needs to document as far as possible which versions 
of software and metadata were used to generate a given result from given 
data (things like RNG seeds too). So when the EPSG file is updated, it 
would be great to be able to "know" about the version from the user 
interface.

The same applies to +proj=utm, which is widely used, and where projection 
to utm from 4.9.3 will give (slightly) different numerical results 
(possibly trivial for practical purposes), but which may for example 
change variogram fitting output (again trivially, but tests for numerical 
equality within machine precision are often used to trap other software 
changes).

If an environment variable was available to revert to legacy behaviour, it 
would be easy to see if downstream changes in performance are down to this 
(agreed, sensible) revision, or to something else.

Sorry to be pedantic, but the difference in understanding is real.

Even,

Please see my reply to Charles. Usually the specification is the exact 
software versions of the workflow components; R provides sessionInfo() to 
record its immediate environment (including locale, which bites often). R 
runs a lot of tests like this across platforms, also on contributed 
packages, and for example 32 bit/64 bit/extended precision issues do get 
trapped across platforms and architectures. Given IEEE numerics, most of 
the other concerns are less important (unless they bite ...). The chain of 
dependencies external to R is less standardised, but attention to this is 
for example described in:

https://www.r-project.org/certification.html

for R "itself". Some of the dependencies have been changing recently to 
work around upstream issues, which is a never ending story; this includes 
a lot of work also in R istelf to handle clang. But reproducible research 
in some (an increasing number) contexts is not an option, it is a 
requirement (within reason). It's partly a mindset, but there are real 
differences in understanding of why applying apparently the same software 
to the same data may give different results.

Best wishes,

Roger

Roger,

Reading your last messages, it seems to me that we are exactly aligned
in our understanding.

First of all (as I'm sure you realize), the results you get from proj.4
*are* reproducible providing you keep track of the version (software +
data files + compiler + build environment + ...).

For any reasonably complex package like proj.4 (and proj.4 is simpler
than most because it doesn't depend on other libraries), lots of things
change from one version to the next (bug fixes, improvements to
algorithms, new capabilities, etc.)  You want an easy way to toggle
these changes in version N to reproduce, selectively, the behavior in
version N-1.

While this is certainly doable, I don't think it's a sustainable
solution to deal with the scores of little fixes that get made to proj.4
during the course of a year.  (The code becomes a mess; testing is a
bigger mess; there will be all sorts of weird interactions between the
resulting environment variables.)

If there is a need to reproduce the old utm behavior in the next release
of proj.4, then I would recommend using tmerc (with the extra parameters
to specify central longitude, false easting, and scale) instead of utm.

And, of course, you always have the choice of sticking with the previous
version of proj.4

There are two separate concerns -- the parameter definitions and the maths that use them. Proj.4 is a mix of both, for better or worse, and at the moment if reproducibility is your primary concern, stick to known, point-in-time, named releases. You must deal with version difference issues downstream, or you must contribute upstream in a way that achieves your downstream goals.

I don't support adding this complexity. Downstream projects that require sensitivity testing like that need to build it themselves or contribute corresponding testing to the Proj.4 project. More knobs and switches just make things harder to maintain and cascades the possible permutations further down the line. The GDAL project, for example, has a number of tests that demonstrate sensitivity issues due to Proj.4 modifications. 

Proj.4 already has a tendency for internal complicatedness, and the people who remember most of it have moved on. There is no incoming audience of developers jumping in to pick up the slack. I think the reasons are because the problem space is indeed very complex (math, intricate metadata), and people write this style of software quite differently now (smaller audience who feels comfortable tinkering with it). Proj.4's ongoing goals 

For some perspective on this please go read ESR's blog posts about rewriting NTPSec [1]. The comparisons are not direct, but I think the sentiment is. Proj.4 exists in a similar space as OpenSSL and NTPSec and friends -- it is foundational infrastructure for a ton of projects, but it has solved the problem, and the interest has all moved on. Proj.4's ongoing challenge is bitrot and lack of a large enough pool of interested developers. Like a building standing alone in the elements, over time it trends toward being indistinguishable from the jungle in which it is surrounded unless people keep up with tasks like clearing the gutters and patching the roof.

In my role as maintainer, I'm here to attempt to stem the tide against this bitrot and try to ensure that Proj.4 continues to have releases. I'm not here to rewrite the software, institute rigorous regression tracking, or bureaucratify Proj.4's non-existant project process. If you wish to do those things, start filing tickets with code attached. 

Contributions that would significantly improve the health of the project include documentation organization and cleanup (we're now set up to do github pages at http://proj4.org which means documentation contribution can for the first time come through the same tool chain as tickets/code). We need more tests that identify and adapt to the precision and dictionary issues you've raised. Finally, we need modernization of the testing framework so it is more convenient to add regression-style tests in a platform-agnostic way. 

When Charles first proposed this modification, I asked that he give fair warning so the change would not silently happen. I know this kind of a modification could cause unexpected data differences, and I wanted to give people who might have opinions on it a chance to chime in. We heard nothing for three weeks, and that's enough permission asking as far as I'm concerned.

> I guess we have to assume that users really read commit logs and NEWS files.

Nowadays, people google things. Between the github ticket(s) and the mailing list posts, we've given them plenty of breadcrumbs to figure out what happened. Much more than a cryptic NEWS entry (which we'll have too).

Subject: [Proj] etmerc original author Knud Poder turns 90.
Message-ID: <CAH0YoEMw5BbQM36eR+_OaX6+zqOouZM23NQLJjQqF_0muV8CVw@mail.gmail.com>

As described in a recent thread, for the next release, proj.4 will switch
the default transverse mercator implementation from tmerc to etmerc.

This is probably a good occasion to reiterate the history of the code for
the etmerc implementation - especially since the original author, Knud
Poder, turned 90 on October 19th. Having his transverse mercator
implementation becoming the proj.4 default is a strikingly proper way of
celebrating Poder, among colleagues and collaborators rightfully considered
“the Nestor of computational geodesy”.

Poder wrote the first version of what is now known as etmerc, around 1961.
It was written in Algol-60 and ran on the GIER computer, built for the
Danish Geodetic Institute (see [1] for details).

The code was based on theoretical foundations published a decade earlier,
by König & Weise ([2], building on prior work by Krüger, 1912 [3]).

Poder’s work was characterized by great care with respect to numerical
precision and accuracy (e.g. by using Clenshaw summation for recurrence
series, and Horner’s scheme for polynomial evaluation).

Also, Poder was noted for his ingeniously implemented “dual autochecking
method” (not used in the proj.4 version), where the same code was used for
forward and inverse projections and was run both ways and compared, to
protect against both coding- and hardware errors. The latter was very
important at a time where the mean time between failure for computer
systems was much shorter than today.

During the 1970s Poder’s student, Karsten Engsager (the “E” in etmerc,
“Engsager Extended Transverse Mercator”) took over maintenance and
eventually extended König and Weise’s numerical series by another term,
bringing the accuracy up to today’s standard.

In 2008, through the efforts of a.o. Gerald Evenden, Frank Warmerdam and
Karsten Engsager, etmerc was introduced in proj.4, while in 2013 Charles
Karney provided 3 corrections - stressing the value and importance of open
source code sharing.

Poder retired 20 years ago, but has been taking active interest in the
maintenance and development of his code ever since. Switching proj.4 to use
a transverse mercator implementation based on his work is probably the best
conceivable way of celebrating the 90th birthday of a great Nestor of
computational geodesy.

In celebration of Knud Poder!
