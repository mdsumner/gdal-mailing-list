Message-ID: <3ACCC358.F604C89C@pobox.com>


Folks, 

Two items.

First, I have modified nad_init() to support loading of Canadian NTv1
grid shift files which are free to use, though lower precision than the
expensive NTv2 grid shift files.  Anyone interested in testing this is
encouraged to contact me. 

Second, I would like to change proj_def.dat to provide a default ellipsoid
of WGS84 (really would make it +datum=WGS84).  The assumption is that in
this day and age WGS84 is a better default than clrk66 (normally NAD27). 
What are peoples opinions on making this change?  Obviously it could 
cause some problems, but I have been bitten a number of times by the 
implicit appending of clrk66.

It sounds good to me.  However, I think that the documentation should
clearly say that the implicit datum is subject from change from time
to time and that any software system interfacing with the PROJ library
or any scripts or configurations which rely on a specific default datum
and which are likely to stay around for a while should use an explicitly
named datum.  Using the implicit datum is for quick-and-dirty work only.

Frank,

  I've purchased the NTv2 data.  Can I use it with this new version of
PROJ.4 without any code modifications or extensive data re-formatting?

I'll vote for WGS 84 as the default ellipsoid and Datum; it's about time
NAD27 be put to rest except for historical cartographic applications.

I believe that "quick and dirty" can accomplish a lot; especially for the
neophyte that is getting access to more and more up-to-date data sets
referenced to NAD 83/WGS 84.

It enables more people to go forth into the world of GIS fat and happy
before they get pounded with Datums.  Although near and dear to my heart,
it is an awful amount of technical stuff (different Datums, ellipsoids,
etc.) for a beginner to digest.

The old Datum is dead.  Long live the "new" Datum!

Brent, 

You can't use it as things stand.  The format is a little different. However,
if you want to provide me with the data, and the developers manual that
comes with it, I would be willing to track and hack in support for it in
a manner similar to NTv1.

Of course, I understand that I can't redistribute the files since users
are supposed to buy them from the geodetic survey.

Wouldn't it be better to select GRS80 as the default ellipsoid? (obviously,
the
difference would be minor, but GRS80 is the one actually recommended by
the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG)

The major point of building in the proj_def.dat system was to make
proj.4 easily responsive to local needs.  Any and all users should
take benefit of this feature and change the "default" ellipsoid to
whatever suits their local needs.

The use of Clarke 66 only reflects what was the common ellipsoid
in use at the time and location of development.

With some help earlier from Frank i compiled the DLL for windows and i am
using the pj_transform to do the coordinate transformations, it works very
well sofar !

Now how would i go about using NAD in this scenario, i suppose i will need
to call nad_init to read the NAD data file but can i have both of them
loaded at the same ? and would this be sufficient to be able to convert like
wgs84 to nad83 just by specifying the datum name in pj_init ?

Any hints would be greatly appreciated,

Sorry if this is documented someplace, i tried, but could not find it,

Bart, 

Since you are using pj_transform() it should be easier than that.  You 
should just need to include the datum definition in your coordinate system
definition.  For instance "+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=NAD27".  This will cause
pj_transform() to load the "nad27" datum shift file for shifts from nad27
to nad83 or vice versa.  

The +datum switch just expands into a definition like
"+nadgrids=conus +ellps=clrk66" so if you want to use other datum shift files,
such as the various state level files, alaska, Puerto Rico and so forth, you
will need to use more specific +nadgrids directives. 

eg. 

+proj=utm +zone=11 +nadgrids=hawaii +ellps=clrk66

The other issue is ensuring the files are found.  A default unix installation
puts the various support files in /usr/local/share/proj but on Windows or
in custom situations you may need to hack pj_open_lib.c to look in your
desired directory.  This can be done by modification of the code, or by
setting the PROJ_LIB environment variable. 

I hope this helps.

Thanks again for your guidance Frank,

Good to hear from you that the pj_transform function should take care of all
this, i guess my only problem is to make it find the file in the right
place, i might just hack the code a bit like you suggest, maybe a generic
way of specifying a path for these files other then setting up an
environment variable would be a usefull option for a future release ?

Any news on version 4.4.4 yet ?

Message-ID: <3AE049E2.CCA11F63@pobox.com>

Folks, 

I have prepared a PROJ.4.4.3 source release.  This release includes:

 o New proj_api.h include file ... a public include file only defining
   stuff required by external applications.  Please try to migrate to using
   this though projects.h will still work as it always did. 

 o Added support for Canadian NTv1 datum shift files. 

 o Fixed 7 parameter datum shifting support. 

 o Added "epsg" translation file, translating all EPSG projected and
   geographic coordinate system definitions into a PROJ.4 equivelent.  

 o Added cs2cs documentation on man page.  Fixed up developer man page somewhat.
 
 o Added pj_init_plus(), pj_is_latlong(), and pj_latlong_from_proj() 
   API entry points, though I don't think they are documented in the man
   page at this time. 

 o Slightly better building for Windows.

 o Various other minor bug fixes. 

Full ChangeLog attached.  Source available at:

  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.4.3.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.4.3.zip

I hope to prepare a binary distribution for Windows in coming days, but if
anyone else would like to do this let me know.  I am always looking for help!

Congratulations, Frank! The next step for us (GRASS Development Team)
will be to syncronize GRASS/PROJ and PROJ4 to make it a plugin...

Thank you for all your work,

Markus, 

I would be willing to play a major role in this, presumably within GRASS 5.1.
In addition to using PROJ.4 as a shared library, rather than including a 
copy within the GRASS source tree, I would also like to iron out a few
quirks about the PROJ-like definition of projections in GRASS to bring it more
into line with the core PROJ schemes (partly modelled on how things are done
in GRASS). 

I would also like to review how datums are handled now in GRASS to see if
the PROJ mechanisms can be used more directly.  

Best regards,

Thanks for the 4.4.3 update Frank !

I have not compiled it yet but already have a question about the epsg file
you created so couragously...

I do understand the conversion was far from trivial and surely you can not
be 100% sure about the accuracy of all of the parameters in there.

I checked the epsg file and for the Netherlands coordinate system i find
that the datum shift is missing there.

Now how can we contribut to the quality of the epsg parameters if a user
like me finds one that can be improved ?
Should we manually update it in the file or should we file a bug report so
you can improve the batch procedure used to generate the file ?
I can easily fix it here in my own copy but i wonder how i can share the fix
with other proj users.

Otherwise the update looks very promising, i'll be compiling it to a DLL and
testing the 7 paramer shift for amersfoort in a few weeks...

Bart, 

I believe the current logic in my code for generating the EPSG mapping is
to only generate a datum definition for coordinates systems where EPSG offers
one, and only one route from that datum directly to WGS84.  This means that
alot of interesting datums end up not being if for instance multiple 
approximations exist.  

For now I would encourage you to file a bug report in Bugzilla, and I will
try to come up with a mechanism to automatically patch selected coordinate
systems based on an override file when doing the automated EPSG to PROJ.4
translations. 

It must be stressed that the epsg definition file isn't well tested, and
I would encourage anyone running into problems with it to report them.  

Best regards,

This makes sense, in the case of the dutch system the right datum
transformation is in there somewhere but my understanding of how all tables
are related is not good enough to figure out what could be the problem, with
the changes made to the data base structure in version 5 of epsg it seems to
become even more difficult to find the right things in there...

I'll wait with that untill i have actually verified the 7 parameter shift so
i can advise you on what is best to use for the Dutch system...

Obviously, i am sure we all appreciate how tricky the epsg to proj
translation must have been...
