Hi,

we just traced the TIF tags with our own tracer for GeoTIFF tags and 
built first an examiner program to see what is in those files. Then when 
noticing that at least some files used "just number" to ESRI/EPGS we had 
to add the database to fill those references. But as I said the system 
only works as long as nobody adds new definitions and uses references to 
them in GeoTIFF files. If I remember correctly there is a way to include 
the full definition in the TIF file but the reality seemed to be that 
most GeoTIFF files just had that "number" reference.

Most likely your CSV files have some database but is it the one that 
includes all what is needed will always be a question (one should at 
least be aware that the possibility exists that the conversion later 
falls due to missing information in the outdated definitions database).

So the transformations are only as good as the data included is. But 
most likely there is an error message that the reference is unknown if 
that happens?! But that definitely adds some work since one has to 
always make sure to include the most resent definitions with the 
package. And sure ESRI/EPSG gets updates all the time since that is why 
it is built like that in the first place.

So the GeoTFF file format standard is not good. (Referencing any 
projection-datum definition without fully defining and including it in 
the file should be forbidden. So to make the GeoTIFF file fully 
independent. Now it is not.)

Subject: [PROJ] "Over flag" for grid shifts
Message-ID: <CAMQBGmX+pYjAiOwLTtjDTEJAHw_2k4KJkmDT43-2k1ZHgS3p6A@mail.gmail.com>

I had a bit of an unusual situation pop up and wondered if anyone here had
any ideas.

Long story short, if you transform from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:4267 (wgs84 to
NAD27) using longitude 180 and latitude 50, you wind up with a longitude of
-179.997. Think of splitting a box across the antimeridian, like a big
bounding box over Russia. Coming from the left, you'd have a longitude of
around 25 to 180, then -180 to about -170. And if you were transforming
them, you'd go 25 to -179.997, which would be the wrong way for the first
section. (The second section would go from -179.997 to -170 in the correct
direction.)

PROJ has that +over flag that generally works as expected, but in this case
the transform's sign change is happening entirely in the hgridshift code
(pj_hgrid_apply_internal to be exact). When it gets to "in.lam =
adjlon(t.lam + extent->west);" it has become -179.997.

adjlon(t.lam + extent->west) * 180 / 3.14159265359
-179.99748513695496

Adding a P->over check around the adjlon call would still result in the
same value.

(t.lam + extent->west)
-3.1415487609496271
(t.lam + extent->west)* 180 / 3.14159265359
-179.99748513695496

Is there any sort of change that could happen inside of that function that
might keep it from changing its sign? Ideally it would be returning 180.003
instead of -179.997.

Hi

I got this wkt, which projection "Transverse Mercator Sjaelland" is not
supported by PROJ

PROJCS["Danish_System_34_Sjaelland", GEOGCS["GCS_European 1950",
DATUM["D_European 1950",
SPHEROID["International_1924",6378388.000000,297.000000]],
PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.000000], UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],
PROJECTION["Transverse Mercator Sjaelland"],
PARAMETER["Scale_Factor",0.999600], PARAMETER["Central_Meridian",9.000000],
PARAMETER["False_Easting",500000.000000], UNIT["Meter",1.000000000000]]

Seems to be something very Danish specific, and quite old. Do you know any
equivalent wkt that may work in PROJ? There were some Danish grid files
added recently for S34

Thanks

That definition definitely looks odd. The correct EPSG id for System 34
Sj?lland
is 10250 (and its companion for the western part of Denmark, "System 34
Jylland"
is EPSG:10160).

For historical reasons, those systems are utterly odd: They originated as
cadastral
systems, and the cadastre did not really care about the absolute
orientation of
the systems, hence ignoring (at that time, i.e. 1930-ish), existing
astro-geodetic
observations, to the effect that what was specified as a transverse cylinder
projection actually ended up as oblique.

Which also means, as noted by Mikael Rittri a decade ago on this mailing
list, that System 34 can be approximated at the metre level by an oblique
mercator
(proj=omerc).

The reconstructions we recently submitted to the EPSG, are based on
transverse
mercator, but use grid based datum shifts to correct for the
mis-orientation and
network tensions.

Message-ID: <CADRrdKsrzJ1rCvab=Vgdk8u9t=p+oT2i5+6QH+LpEGbgKEvUdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Having a look at proj.db, I have seen a column in the table
"grid_alternatives" called "open_license"
What is the purpose of this field? (apart from allowing a meaningless "url")
I guess it is not effectively used in the code.

The three entries with this field to "0" are a bit redundant, right?
"original_grid_name" and "old_proj_grid_name" are the same. Are those
entries needed?

Thanks.

It is reported as a metadata information in 
proj_grid_get_info_from_database(), so users can make an informed 
choice. It is used only for the following 2 grids which are publicly 
available but whose license terms are not considered open data:

('naptrans2008.gtx','','naptrans2008.gtx','GTX','geoid_like',0,NULL,'https://salsa.debian.org/debian-gis-team/proj-rdnap/raw/upstream/2008/naptrans2008.gtx',1,0,NULL),
('rdtrans2008.gsb','','rdtrans2008.gsb','NTv2','hgridshift',0,NULL,'https://salsa.debian.org/debian-gis-team/proj-rdnap/raw/upstream/2008/rdtrans2008.gsb',1,0,NULL),
('netherlands/rdtrans2008','','rdtrans2008.gsb','NTv2','hgridshift',0,NULL,'https://salsa.debian.org/debian-gis-team/proj-rdnap/raw/upstream/2008/rdtrans2008.gsb',1,0,NULL),

> The three entries with this field to "0" are a bit redundant, right?

No I don't think so. There are 2 different grids. And the rdtrans2008 
one has a different name if it is used by EPSG records or ESRI records, 
hence 2 records for it as original_grid_name is the key.


> "original_grid_name" and "old_proj_grid_name" are the same. Are those 
> entries needed?

There are tons of records where they are different like:

INSERT INTO grid_alternatives(original_grid_name,
 ????????????????????????????? proj_grid_name,
 ????????????????????????????? old_proj_grid_name,
 ????????????????????????????? proj_grid_format,
 ????????????????????????????? proj_method,
 ????????????????????????????? inverse_direction,
 ????????????????????????????? package_name,
 ????????????????????????????? url, direct_download, open_license, 
directory)
 ????????????????????? VALUES ('conus.las',
 ????????????????????????????? 'us_noaa_conus.tif',
 ????????????????????????????? 'conus',
 ????????????????????????????? 'GTiff',
 ????????????????????????????? 'hgridshift',
 ????????????????????????????? 0,
 ????????????????????????????? NULL,
'https://cdn.proj.org/us_noaa_conus.tif', 1, 1, NULL);


old_proj_grid_name corresponds to known grid names by PROJ before PROJ 7 
and the migration to GeoTIFF, so NTv2, CTable2 and GTX files

original_grid_name corresponds to the """"official"""" name in the 
registry imported by PROJ, so most of the time the one used by EPSG (and 
a few ones from ESRI or IGNF)

Message-ID: <f9ba578d61a4443a8e19e50f08b86d48@knmi.nl>

Hi!

We have some datasets where the proj string starts and ends with a double quote ("). We want to trim these off in our application (adaguc-server).

Do you think a double quote will ever be used in the proj string? E.g. can we simply remove all " signs in the proj string?

Best regards,
Maarten Plieger

Do you mean "in some place where we store proj strings, they have
leading and trailing quotes"?    Or are you really invoking proj
command-line tools or libraries and passing the quotes?

> Do you think a double quote will ever be used in the proj string? E.g. can we simply remove all " signs in the proj string?

Did you read the documentation, and is there a specification?

Removing all " seems like quite a leap and asking for trouble, when you
don't know, and you either haven't read the specification or there isn't
such a rule.  Remember that specifications control what happens in the
future without a breaking change announceent, so how it works today is
only part of the question.

Instead, I would add a rule on reading them that says if leading " and
trailing ", remove those two.

And then look at anything else with a " and think about it.  Please
report back with what you found as it may help others.

Subject: [PROJ] ST_Transform returning different results in PostGIS 2.x and
 PostGIS 3.x
Message-ID: <01EE86EA-2DB9-409E-AE61-DB96B52D78A0@gmail.com>

Hello,

I am facing a problem with the function st_transform()and here is my analysis of this pb:

Example of SQL query with different results depending on PostGIS version:
select st_astext(st_transform(st_setsrid(st_point(398845.80866241, 6822815.8927889), 2154), 932001))

Projection 932001 to insert in spatial_ref_sys for testing :

INSERT into spatial_ref_sys (srid, auth_name, auth_srid, proj4text, srtext) values ( 932001, 'IGNF' , 320002101 , '+proj=lcc +nadgrids=ntf_r93.gsb,null +a=6378249.2000 +rf=293.4660210000000 +pm=2.337229167 +lat_0=49.500000000 +lon_0=0.000000000 +k_0=0.99987734 +lat_1=49.500000000 +x_0=600000.000 +y_0=200000.000 +units=m +no_defs' , 'PROJCS["Lambert I",GEOGCS["Nouvelle Triangulation Fran?aise Paris grades",DATUM["NTF",SPHEROID["Clarke 1880 IGN",6378249.2000,293.4660210000000,AUTHORITY["IGNF","ELG010"]],TOWGS84[-168.0000,-60.0000,320.0000,0,0,0,0],AUTHORITY["IGNF","REG002"]],PRIMEM["Paris",2.337229167,AUTHORITY["IGNF","LGO02"]],UNIT["grad",0.01570796326794897],AXIS["Longitude",EAST],AXIS["Latitude",NORTH],AUTHORITY["IGNF","NTFP"]],PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic_1SP",AUTHORITY["IGNF","PRC0101"]],PARAMETER["semi_major",6378249.2000],PARAMETER["semi_minor",6356515.0000],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",49.500000000],PARAMETER["central_meridian",0.000000000],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.99987734],PARAMETER["false_easting",600000.000],PARAMETER["false_northing",200000.000],UNIT["metre",1],AXIS["Easting",EAST],AXIS["Northing",NORTH],AUTHORITY["IGNF","LAMB1"]]?);


This projection 932001 corresponds to Lambert Zone 1 corrected with the IGN grid.

On our PostgreSQL 10 / PostGIS 2.4 machine, we get:
POINT(347762.11171084 87364.0318659853)

While in PostgresQL 13 / PostGIS 3.0, we get this (result which is incorrect):
POINT(347200.5307476731 637506.2948565462)

Result of the query select postgis_full_version(); on our 2 environments:
PostgreSQL 10 : POSTGIS="2.4.7 r17330" PGSQL="100" GEOS="3.7.1-CAPI-1.11.1 27a5e771" PROJ="Rel. 4.9.3, 15 August 2016" GDAL="GDAL 2.3.2, released 2018/09/21" LIBXML="2.9.1" LIBJSON="0.11" RASTER


PostgresSQL 13 : POSTGIS="3.1.8 c5ebc1f" [EXTENSION] PGSQL="130" GEOS="3.10.3-CAPI-1.16.1" PROJ="8.2.1" LIBXML="2.9.7" LIBJSON="0.13.1" LIBPROTOBUF="1.3.0" WAGYU="0.5.0 (Internal)? TOPOLOGY

What solution can make this work with PostGIS 3.x? 

I already created an issue on gis.stackexchange and one contributor tried to help me but his recommendations did not work for me. And he recommended that i?d subscribe to the mailing list and try here.
(ref: https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/465055/st-transform-returning-different-results-in-postgis-2-4-and-postgis-3-0?noredirect=1#comment760991_465055)

Thank you so much for your time ! appreciated.

Regards,

PCS members,

No issues have been reported with PROJ 9.3.0RC2 or PROJ-data 1.15RC1, so I
hereby motion that they are promoted to their final releases.

I?ll start with my +1.
