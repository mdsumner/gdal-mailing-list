Jan / Bernhard,

I am not in a position to update the old PROJ documentation so I can't change
references in it.  Hopefully at some point we will have comprehensive new
documentation.  The pj_init.3 man page *has* been updated to describe the
modern approach.

In the meantime, as I mentioned, applications should just use proj_api.h
unless they need some internal information available in projects.h.  I will
continue to install projects.h by default in order to provide backwards
compatibility for applications setup to use the traditional PROJ include file.

Best regards,

You are right. I did not had a look into this man page.
Maybe it should be referenced under "SEE ALSO" on the proj manpage.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] projection software - swiss projection
Message-ID: <3F5EE9BF.E93E88D8@giub.unibe.ch>

Hello there,

I have an ER-Mapper file, which is a simple binary file (bil) and a
separate header file including all information about the file and the
projection (see below).
I would like to convert this file into the Swiss projection (Projection:
Oblique, Spheroid: Bessel).
As we work in an operational way, the reprojection should be made
without any human intervention and work automatically.
We work on a Linux environment and most programs are written in C or
IDL. We do not use an ER-Mapper software nor could we use ArcInfo
operationally.

I found several sources of public domain cartographic software that
perform projections but which software do you recommend?
Is PROJ.4 the best way?

Thank you a lot for your help and advice!!

Best regards,
Nando

header file:
DatasetHeader Begin
 Version = "6.0"

Message-ID: <3F603AF9.DB0169EB@giub.unibe.ch>

Hello outhere,

I have very simple question which I couldn't answer by myself for sure,
even when reading the manuals...

Is't possible and recommendable to use PROJ.4 for reprojection of
satellite (raster) data from geographic (WGS84) to swiss projection.
What about resampling of the pixel values? Or is PROJ.4 specially used
for reprojection of vector data?

Thanks a lot for an answer of this simple but for me important question!

Best regards, Nando

Nando,

PROJ.4 just transforms coordinates, and has no knowledge of "vectors" or
"rasters" though there are packages built on PROJ.4 for doing both.  For
raster warping based on PROJ.4 you could use GDAL.

For example the following would warp a GeoTIFF file in some appropriate
input coordinate system (defined in the file) to UTM 11.

   gdalwarptest -t_srs '+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84' in.tif out.tif

GDAL can be found at:

  http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/

Hello Frank (and all others)

Thanks a lot for your promising advice. Before I get started I would like to
describe  my problem more precise to see if I really could use GDAL effectually:
(I 'm getting through the manuals but I could not answer my questions by myself
for sure):
I have an er-mapper file (we are not working with ERMapper-software), which is a
binary file (BIL) and a header file (see below).
The binary file is an 8-bit raster file (AVHRR satellite data generated product).
We work in an operational way without any human intervention using Linux Redhat.
I would like to reproject all our files from geographic wgs84 lat/long to the
swiss projection.
How realistic is that for using GDAL? What would be the biggest problems?

Thank you very much for any help!!!
Cheers, Nando

I wrote a small wrapper for the proj dll currently available (4.4.6) so that I could
use the library in VB/VBA code with some success.  It basically just wraps __stdcall
around the API; nothing as fancy as a COM dll.

Anyway, others might have some use for it:
