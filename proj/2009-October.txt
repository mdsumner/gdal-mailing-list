Subject: [Proj] converting WGS84 to NAD27
Message-ID: <4709511f0910041522g73de9775r10d61993b96c218a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to convert WGS84 coordinates to UTM and NAD27. I'm using
the route-me library, which is a thin wrapper on proj4. It just
creates the PJ objects using pj_init_plus on the strings, and calls
pg_transform. The transformation to UTM works correctly, but the NAD27
transformation doesn't change the coordinates. Does anyone know what I
might be doing wrong?

CLLocationCoordinate2D coord = {60, -119};
int zone = ((coord.longitude + 186) / 6);

RMProjection* latLonProj = [[RMProjection alloc]
initWithString:@"+proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84"];
RMProjection* utmProj = [[RMProjection alloc] initWithString:
[NSString stringWithFormat:@"+proj=utm +zone=%d +ellps=WGS84", zone]];

RMTransform* trans = [[RMTransform alloc] initFrom:latLonProj To:utmProj];

CLLocationCoordinate2D transCoord = [trans projectForward:coord AtZoom:9];
NSLog(@"UTM Coord %f, %f %d" , transCoord.latitude, transCoord.longitude, zone);

RMProjection* nad27Proj = [[RMProjection alloc]
initWithString:@"+proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84 +datum=NAD27 +no_defs"];
trans = [[RMTransform alloc] initFrom:latLonProj To:nad27Proj];
transCoord = [trans projectForward:coord AtZoom:9];
NSLog(@"NAD27 Coord %f, %f" , transCoord.latitude, transCoord.longitude);

**output**
UTM Coord 6653097.435298, 388455.958023 11
NAD27 Coord 60.000000, -119.000000


Thanks,
Anna

Anna,

You should probably install those 'datum shift grid files' as per
http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/, and set up their location in the PROJ_LIB
environment setting.
In case if you're on Windows the files are already included in the
pre-compiled packages available from here: http://vbkto.dyndns.org:1280/sdk/
The files are located in the /bin/proj/SHARE subdirectory.

Best regards,

Tamas

Subject: [Proj] Getting X Y in a .map OZI calibrated map
Message-ID: <804d10b90910121045j3b31c268qfc4a50483d4cc576@mail.gmail.com>

I have some .map OZI calibrated maps. From those .map, I can get some
calibration points (x y in the jpeg picture + lon lat in WGS84).

MMPXY,1,142,142
MMPXY,2,5217,142
MMPXY,3,5217,3422
MMPXY,4,142,3422
MMPLL,1,  -0.269639,  39.626293
MMPLL,2,  -0.186306,  39.626293
MMPLL,3,  -0.186306,  39.584626
MMPLL,4,  -0.269639,  39.584626

With that I build a coordinates file

-0.269639  39.626293 (142,142)
-0.186306  39.626293 (5217,142)
-0.186306  39.584626 (5217,3422)
-0.269639  39.584626 (142,3422)

>From the .map file I can also know that the map projection is UTM

Map Projection,(UTM) Universal Transverse
Mercator,PolyCal,No,AutoCalOnly,No,BSBUseWPX,Yes

With proj4 I get the projection of those points in UTM

$ proj +proj=utm +ellps=WGS84 coord
734345.05       4389843.39 (142,142)
741498.53       4390064.29 (5217,142)
741643.45       4385438.93 (5217,3422)
734485.67       4385218.08 (142,3422)

El objetivo es dadas unas coordenadas cualquieras dentro del mapa (p.e.
-0.269058 39.599662), obtener el punto x y en el mismo.
The goal is knowing a pair of coordinates in the map (for instance -0.269058
39.599662), get the x y pixel in the map.

$ proj +proj=utm +ellps=WGS84
-0.269058 39.599662
734484.83       4386888.69

How can I calcultate the X Y pixel for those coordinates having all this
data? Am I in the right way

Thank you very much

Subject: [Proj] msProcessProjection(): Projection library error. no system
 list, errno: 13
Message-ID: <4AD45BD9.9060100@romtelecom.ro>

Hello everyone!

I'm trying to troubleshoot a proj error, and I need your help! I have 
started this thread also on the mapserver mailing list, but I didn't 
find a solution yet: 
http://n2.nabble.com/msProcessProjection-Projection-library-error-no-system-list-errno-13-td3807641.html

I'm running mapserver, and I'm trying to configure it to act as a WMS 
server. My data is in wgs84 (epsg:4326) and I want to project it to 
mercator projection (epsg:900913).

I have configured the mapfile and the projections according to the 
Mapserver documentation and they work as long as the projection sections 
are defined like:
PROJECTION
    #spherical mercator/google
     "+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 
+y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +no_defs"
END

and

PROJECTION
    #WGS84
    "+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"
END

If I ask for EPSG projections (through WMS), I get the error in the subject.
Here is my WMS url:

http://terra/cgi-bin/mapserv?map=/var/www/html/map/rtc_base.map&SERVICE=WMS&VERSION=1.1.1&REQUEST=GetMap&LAYERS=GranitaJudete&STYLES=&SRS=EPSG:900913


I have tried to debug the problem by using shp2img, and it seems that 
mapserver tries to open /usr/share/proj/null as a file. I created a 
symlink between /usr/share/proj/epsg and /usr/share/proj/null, and now 
shp2img reads the file, but I get the same error while trying to call 
the WMS server.

My question is: how can I try to troubleshoot this issue - to see if 
there's a problem with proj?

I'd like to mention that I have added <900913> +proj=merc +a=6378137 
+b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m 
+nadgrids=@null <mailto:+nadgrids=@null> +no_defs to my epsg file and my 
proj version is:
[adrianp at terra mapserver]$ rpm -qa | grep proj
proj-devel-4.5.0-1.fc5
proj-4.5.0-1.fc5

Adrian

The correct EPSG number for this projection is 3857 (900913 is obsolete).
Recent version of PROJ.4 contain this definition in the epsg file :

<3857> +proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0

Hello Jean-Claude,

Unfortunately I can't upgrade my proj version because it's running on a 
kind of "legacy" server and changing it would break other things.
I have added the new projection code to the epsg file, but it still 
doesn't work. It gives the same error.

I would like an example of command line syntax for running proj - 
because I suspect it doesn't read the correct epsg file.

I don't know if it's important but my epsg file is a symlink to the real 
file. It may be an issue if the mapserver process running as apache 
can't read through symlinks...

[root at terra map]# ls -l /usr/share/proj/epsg
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 24 Oct 13 16:01 /usr/share/proj/epsg -> 
/usr/share/proj/nad/epsg

UPDATE:

Woohoo - I've changed the symlink to a hard link and now it works!
So, it seems there were some issues with apache, not being able to read 
through symlinks (maybe because it is disabled by default?)!
The moral of the story? Make sure /usr/share/proj/epsg is not a symlink!

Byte,

Do you have the proj string or the EPSG code for the projection you use
natively in Germany? I think it is needed to see what ellipsoid/spheroid
is native to you to determine the +towgs84 transformation.

Greetings =)

Could someone please help with projection issues?

In trying to convert a raster image (gif) into a geotiff so that it can
be reprojected into mercator. I'm very new at this so have attempted to
read the docs carefully, but i have clearly made a mistake.

Since i'm new, and am using a linux box I have found that gdal seems to
be the way to go, unless someone has a better suggestion (need command
line for automation).

The projection information for the gif image is that it is a lambert
conformal conic, but specifies a tangent latitude, instead of the normal
1 or two latitudes of natural origin. Here is the info and source
information:

########## SOURCE PROJECTION INFORMATION ###################
## REF http://www.nws.noaa.gov/noaaport/html/icdtb48e.html #
############################################################
Eastern CONUS Lambert
Satellite: GOES East
Projection: Lambert Conformal
Tangent Latitude: 25.000N
Reference Longitude: 95.000W
Reference Grid: AWIPS Grid 211*
* The Dx, Dy grid increment (at 25 deg north) w as selected
so that the grid spacing would be exactly 80.0 00 k m at
35 deg north

Lower Left: 16.369N 113.133W
Lower Right: 14.335N 65.091W
Upper Right: 57.289N 49.385W
Upper Left: 59.844N 123.044W

1.0159Km @ 25.000N Visible
5120x5120
########################

so not knowing what I am doing, and googling for all that i can find I
came up with the following means to set the projection, and reproject.

gdal_translate -of gtiff -a_srs '+proj=lcc +lat_ts=25 \
+lon_0=-95 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs' \
-a_ullr -123.044 59.844 -65.091 14.335 test.gif test.tif


I'm guessing the 'lat_ts' parameter is incorrect, i just happened to see
it somewhere, but i have also tried setting the two lat parameters to 25
as well, which did not work. I also tried using default lcc projection
information from ArcView for that projection to no avail.

Once finished my settings so far to convert to mercator are as follows
gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=merc +a=6378137 \
 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 \
 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +no_defs' test.tif mercator.tif

I would really appreciate any help anyone can offer.. i've been banging
my head off the wall trying to figure this out, it has sort of become a
quest now... the issue seems to be using a tangent latitude instead of
the 1 or 2 latitudes of origin.

thanks much,

--buddy

I would hazard a guess that he's trying to convert from EPSG:4326 to
EPSG:31466 ...

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=6 +k=1 +x_0=2500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel

for this area you can try:
+towgs84=631,23,451

which you can find documented here:
http://www.bezreg-koeln.nrw.de/brk_internet/organisation/abteilung07_produkte/raumbezug/bezugssystem_uebergaenge/index.html

May be you have to fiddle around with the signs.

Also you can try to use the BeTA2007 NTv2-Grid
with +nadgrids which you can download here:
http://www.crs-geo.eu/nn_124226/crseu/EN/CRS__Description/crs-national__node.html?__nnn=true

Hope that helps.

Uwe

Hello,

PROJ.4 already contains the +towgs84 parameter :

cs2cs -v +init=epsg:31466
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#	Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +init=epsg:31466 +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=6 +k=1 +x_0=2500000 +y_0=0
# +ellps=bessel +datum=potsdam +units=m +no_defs +towgs84=606.0,23.0,413.0
#--- following specified but NOT used
# +ellps=bessel
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic alias)
#	
# +proj=latlong +datum=potsdam +ellps=bessel +towgs84=606.0,23.0,413.0

If it is not correct, you can find other ones in the EPSG database :

For my ttMaps software, I have used:
  +towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.70


BTW, when you ask such a question, it is always better to give an 
example (input coords, output coords, expected coords).

If in doubt about parameters, one could consult:

For instance, the page:
http://www.lverma.nrw.de/produkte/raumbezug/koordinatentransformation/Koordinatentransformation.htm

Subject: [Proj] lcc tangent latitude
Message-ID: <20091015143735.8F491448C8@ws5-1.us4.outblaze.com>

Greetings =)

Could someone please help with projection issues?

In trying to convert a raster image (gif) into a geotiff so that it can
be reprojected into mercator. I'm very new at this so have attempted to
read the docs carefully, but i have clearly made a mistake.

Since i'm new, and am using a linux box I have found that gdal seems to
be the way to go, unless someone has a better suggestion (need command
line for automation).

The projection information for the gif image is that it is a lambert
conformal conic, but specifies a tangent latitude, instead of the normal
1 or two latitudes of natural origin. Here is the info and source
information:

########## SOURCE PROJECTION INFORMATION ###################
## REF http://www.nws.noaa.gov/noaaport/html/icdtb48e.html #
############################################################
Eastern CONUS Lambert
Satellite: GOES East
Projection: Lambert Conformal
Tangent Latitude: 25.000N
Reference Longitude: 95.000W
Reference Grid: AWIPS Grid 211*
* The Dx, Dy grid increment (at 25 deg north) w as selected
so that the grid spacing would be exactly 80.0 00 k m at
35 deg north

Lower Left: 16.369N 113.133W
Lower Right: 14.335N 65.091W
Upper Right: 57.289N 49.385W
Upper Left: 59.844N 123.044W

1.0159Km @ 25.000N Visible
5120x5120
########################

so not knowing what I am doing, and googling for all that i can find I
came up with the following means to set the projection, and reproject.

gdal_translate -of gtiff -a_srs '+proj=lcc +lat_ts=25 \
+lon_0=-95 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs' \
-a_ullr -123.044 59.844 -65.091 14.335 test.gif test.tif


I'm guessing the 'lat_ts' parameter is incorrect, i just happened to see
it somewhere, but i have also tried setting the two lat parameters to 25
as well, which did not work. I also tried using default lcc projection
information from ArcView for that projection to no avail.

Once finished my settings so far to convert to mercator are as follows
gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=merc +a=6378137 \
 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 \
 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +no_defs' test.tif mercator.tif

I would really appreciate any help anyone can offer.. i've been banging
my head off the wall trying to figure this out, it has sort of become a
quest now... the issue seems to be using a tangent latitude instead of
the 1 or 2 latitudes of origin.

thanks much,

Message-ID: <1256898331.29121.45.camel@acme.pacific>

Is there a way to tell proj4 that the lat/long values are, say, degrees
and fractions of degrees (dd.dddd), or degrees and minutes and fractions
of minutes (ddmm.mmmm)? I don't see this mentioned in the docs. I have
no trouble converting them, but in my use, it would be ever so much
easier if the conversion was handled in proj. Just curious.

proj4 accepts both formats :

$ proj +init=epsg:32631
3.5 43.5
540422.19	4816462.79
3d30.000' 43d30.000'

My data is a third representation:

3.5 in dd.ddd is 330.0 in ddmm.mmmm
43.5 in dd.ddd is 4330.0 in ddmm.mmmm

The ddmm.mmmm format is how Trimble receivers provide lat/long values in
NMEA GGA records, while the dd.dddd format is what Garmin receivers
provide in their NMEA GGA records.

My absolute preference would be to be able to tell the garmin to provide
ddmm.mmmm, and not dd.ddd. The users of the Garmin claim this is not
possible. So I am exploring options.

You could read the fabulous manual:
Cartographic Projection Procedures for the UNIX Environment—A User’s Manual
by Gerald I. Evenden, Open-File Report 90–284
On page 3 are the several forms of input data delineated.
The manuals as pdfs can be found on the proj website.

Of course I did this. I should have pointed out that I am doing this
from the C API. So, I send floating point numbers to pj_transform().
None of the various markups allowed on text input apply at this point.

I can of course change the representation before calling pj_transform().
And I expect this will be the method I wind up using. But in my code,
and for simplicity and consistency, a low-level solution is best. So, I
am just curious if pj_transform() can be told to expect dd.dddd or
ddmm.mmmm. Perhaps as an option to pj_init_plus() along the line of
"+proj=latlong".

I am trying to sort out my options. It would be bad if I re-did
something pj_transform() can already do. So, I am just checking first.

To be honest, I would not think pj_transform() should do this. It would
make most sense if it expected one representation, and left any fiddling
to the caller.

But I had to ask. The list has been too quite :)

Roger,

No, it cannot.  Angular values need to be decimal radians at this point.

I'm not keen in adding such interpretation at this level.

Ah! I didn't realise such a format was among the actually used ones.
Shouldn't the EPSG database list this format in the section 
epsg_unitofmeasure?
Or is it a proprietary format, only used by Trimble?
Anyhow, wouldn't it be more productive if the PROJ command line had a flag, 
denoting the format of the DMS input and output?

I come across dd.dd ddmm.mm and ddmmss.ss

Frank reminded me that it is radians that I am passing. Of course this
is the case. Too much to keep track of. And, it is Friday (and a partial
holiday in Sweden).

So the answer to my question is that I must arrange dealing with this
outside proj4. Which I am fully in agreement with.

> Or is it a proprietary format, only used by Trimble?

I cannot say. I would be curious to know what is the most common. I
think the NMEA standard states ddmm.mm. So I think it is the Garmin that
is non-standard. Even if it is very common. We have always used Trimble.
And Applanix. I will have to check what we are doing with Applanix data.
The Garmin experiment is for those of our users not requiring accuracy
beyond some meters.

For data arriving at the library via that route, perhaps. My use is via
the C API in an application that tracks locations in real time. We use
the library direct, providing radians.
