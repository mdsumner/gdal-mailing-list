Message-ID: <loom.20150906T174143-519@post.gmane.org>

Please may I ask when a new release will be forthcoming to remedy the
serious shortcoming of the 4.9.1 release? This has now propogated and is
causing chaos in uses in the R world. For example, the Debian proj-data
package does not have proj_def.dat, I don't know about other distributions.
In reply to my report on Trac 19 May: 

"different behaviour across platforms: pj_init_plus" #274 

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/274

and apparently fixed by hobu 27 May. Trunk has the forgotten file, but we
are now seeing widening repercussions of its absence in the 4.9.1 release,
because users are installing plugins/packages for R built against this
release. We have manually added the missing file to the proj/ folder for our
Windows and OSX binary packages, but cannot protect users installing the
packages/plugins from source.

Should a new release not be forthcoming, how may one recover the absolute
path of a file found by pj_open_lib() to determine the directory in which
the other files reside? Currently this is a PAFile, and recovering its file
descriptor isn't obvious. If I had that, I could copy all the PROJ_LIB files
to a temporary directory, add a copy of missing proj_def.dat, and set
PROJ_LIB to suit for the duration of the R session (or until the package
(plugin) was unloaded).

As a temporary solution for this problem, I've updated the proj Debian
package to install proj_def.dat again.

The just uploaded proj (4.9.1-3) contains two patches, the first adds
nad/proj_def.dat as currently on the GitHub master branch, the second is
the nad/Makefile.am change by hobu to install proj_def.dat again.

proj (4.9.1-3) should migrate to testing in 5 days. Ubuntu should pick
it up soon for the upcoming wily release.

I'm not sure what the procedure is to generate release tarballs, so I
couldn't test if the Makefile.am change is sufficient to have
proj_def.dat included in the release tarballs too.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Thank you very much, this will certainly help many users (provided that they
update their systems once 4.9.1-3 becomes available). I'll post on R-sig-geo
to alert them.

Does anyone know how to warn other packagers - I had hoped people would pick
this up from Trac in May, but was alarmed to find that nothing had been done?

This thread is the first I hear of this issue, so that's a good start.
Filing bugreports on the various distribution packages is probably the
best way to get the attention of the various distribution maintainers
who don't read this list. The best way to get distribution maintainers
attention is with a new upstream release.

If you want to hunt down the distributions including PROJ.4 you can use
the whohas utility to query the various distribution repositories.

FYI:
The proj package situation in Fedora/EPEL is (see
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/packageinfo?packageID=3521)

EPEL:           4.8.x
Fedora 18-22: 4.8.x
Fedora 23:      4.9.x

I wonder if all packagers actually read here...

Following the procedure in HOWTO-RELEASE fails to generate a tarball,
`make dist-all` fails because nad/testflaky is missing. This seems to be
a typo, because nad/testflakey does exist. I've pushed a fix for this:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/296

With the flaky fix `make dist-all` works, but the generated tarball
doesn't contain nad/proj_def.dat. I've pushed another fix to address
this too: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/297

Hopefully these two fixes are sufficient to get a new release out soon.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Same problem here, no proj_def.dat in 4.9.1-3 builds of proj-nad:

http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/rpminfo?rpmID=6454906

but present in 4.8.0-7:

http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/rpminfo?rpmID=5469358.

Indeed, that was what I did as soon as I'd diagnosed the problem, in #274,
then in Trac, but migrated to:

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/274

The problem was then said to have been fixed (May 20), and:

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2015-May/007126.html

said that: "I think we should issue a new 4.9.2 release as a result", but
nothing happened apart from everything being moved to github at about the
same time.

Currently generating a lot of error messages under Fedora 22 for me,
unfortunately. Since the proj PSC made the mess, I guess the management
model needs urgent reconsideration. Certainly an urgent, properly checked
4.9.2 release is justified by this file omission.

Sebastian,

I've merged the 2 fixes. Thanks

And I've added also additional fixes : proj_def.dat was also missing in cmake, 
and there were also other 4 files in nad/ that weren't in the EXTRA_DIST. I 
realized that when adding a "self-consistency" check in .travis.yml: basically 
I do a make install from the git checkout, then a make dist-all, build and 
install (in another target dir) from the archive generated by make dist-all, 
and compare the list of installed files ( 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/ba3454ec0f9d1d33e165d0ace70f766c8283892e 
)

My guess is that nobody actually released from a tarball generated by "make 
dist-all" before, but just zipped the content of a fresh svn export.

Another related topic is : what should be the policy with automake/autoconf 
generated files in git :
- regenerate them and commit them each time they are modified. Advantage: the 
export from git is always valid. Drawback: it is easy to forget regenerating
- regenerate them only just before release time (so travis build would need to 
run ./autogen.sh)
- drop them from git completely ( that's what is suggested by 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/282 )

"make distcheck" is helpful.  It produces a distfile, and then unpacks
it and does a build with a different objdir and then runs make check in
that.

my $0.02:

* Definitely remove them, and tell people run autogen.sh to create them
  when building from git.  This is the normal practice and works well.

* Define that the only valid way to create a release tarball is "make
  dist".  (I'm not sure what else you mean by "export from git".)

(I maintain the proj package in pkgsrc, a multi-arch multi-OS packaging
system.)

I definitely agree with Greg: Autogenerated files have nothing to do under
source control. They are not source files, after all.

My preference is also to remove them entirely, but we need to have some kind of policy on what the autotools/automake variant is that does 'make dist' that ultimately makes the distribution for release. If I were to do 'make dist' from my OSX environment and then release that, many would not be happy with it, for example. We have this same challenge in libgeotiff too.

I will issue a 4.9.2-RC1 tarball this afternoon.

Sure, that's reasonable.  Probably autoconf/automake need to have the
minimum versions declared in their source files, and arguably that
should be good enough.

Good, please provide a complete timeline (explaining delays), and report on
this list (or elsewhere, provided we know where) wrt. slippage. We are now
well past "this afternoon", for September 7, right? 

The tarball, when it arrives, will be on:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/

will it? Or where? While peoples' eyes are on this now, it would be
unfortunate to let it go off-radar ...

Thanks for bringing this up on the list. Ever since your post, I've been
meaning to do so but became too busy to do so. Since the consensus so far
appears in favour, I'll make sure to rebase so that there are no longer any
merge conflicts.

Thanks for raising the main question of process management. The 4.9.2
release was indicated 20 May by Howard, but nothing happened, for reasons
unknown. I provided a work-around in rgdal for R that seemed to work, and
made sure the CRAN binaries for OSX and Windows (built static and shipped
with proj/) included the missing file. As the number of Debian/Fedora users
and others with 4.9.1 has increased, it has become obvious that the
work-around was insufficient (I was notified on Friday, and the patched
rgdal was on the R archive network on Sunday fixing two inadequacies). I've
tried to handle it using pj_set_searchpath(), but haven't been able to do
so. Consequently, I need to know the structure and timeline of the release
process to communicate this further to others, so that relying on an
unsatisfactory work-around is made unnecessary.

If someone says:

"I will issue a 4.9.2-RC1 tarball this afternoon"

I tend to think that they mean what they say, so arguably should follow up
to let those interested know the current status. If there are good reasons
for the delay, well and good, whatever they may be. But let us know ... the
RC needs checking broadly, so keeping things moving forward is vital (think
4.9.0...).

I'm on this list (and returned from a long vacation+work).

EPEL version cannot change now, as we cannot introduce API breakage in
EPEL. Sorry about that. I'm glad that we could add 4.9 to Fedora 23, so
that RHEL 8 will at least have that version.

The new files in nad/ in 4.9.2 compared with 4.9.1 are:

 nad/ntf_r93.gsb
 nad/ntv1_can.dat
 nad/null.lla
 nad/nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb
 nad/proj_def.dat
 nad/testflaky
 nad/tf_out.dist

This now duplicates files that are also extracted from the
proj-datumgrids zipfile.

ntf_r93.gsb, ntv1_can.dat & nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb are included in
proj-datumgrid-1.5 & proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 too.

null.lla is only in proj-datumgrid-1.5, because proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1
has switched to the "CTable2" format that doesn't require compiling the
.lla files anymore.

I think only nad/proj_def.dat, nad/testflaky & nad/tf_out.dist should be
included in proj 4.9.2, the others should remain in proj-datumgrid.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I've submitted a PR for the above:

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/301

The files also found in proj-datumgrids are not included in the release
tarballs nor installed, and the test & builds are only included in the
tarball but not installed. This addresses the issues I ran into updating
the proj Debian package to 4.9.2 RC1.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Must be related to those 2 commits:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/a4c7892a94667e62d62caa053ac4b51ef790741c
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/0a7eda807da1e17f60558acebd89a08872b5b6e9

The tf_out.dist thing added in EXTRA_DIST was 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/502a63f77a59852056abcc5dbb0178e52d7d17e9 
(probably fine since needed by make check due to the new testflaky)

What you point here is files bundled in the .tar.gz, so linked to  EXTRA_DIST 
additions. Now I think I understand the reason why I added null.lla 
ntf_r93.gsb nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb ntv1_can.dat to EXTRA_DIST.
Those files are in the .git tree and when you build and do make install from 
git, they are installed in share/proj. But if you did (before 
a4c7892a94667e62d62caa053ac4b51ef790741c) a make dist and rebuilt proj from 
that, they were no longer installed. Which seemed inconsistant (broke the test 
I added in 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/ba3454ec0f9d1d33e165d0ace70f766c8283892e)
But now that they are in the .tar.gz, they are (or their compiled result) is 
now installed in share/proj, which isn't desirable.

The addition of null.lla ntf_r93.gsb nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb ntv1_can.dat to 
pkgdata_DATA is more or less a consequence of that, in an attempt of having 
make distcheck to work.

So I think we should revert a4c7892a94667e62d62caa053ac4b51ef790741c, 
0a7eda807da1e17f60558acebd89a08872b5b6e9 and 
ba3454ec0f9d1d33e165d0ace70f766c8283892e . Sorry for the mess.

(Hum actually I see that nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb is used by src/multistresstest.c, 
so it should in theory be needed in EXTRA_DIST if we'd want to have as feature 
full testing in the .tar.gz as in git. But if we do so, per the above, make && 
make install will install it, which isn't desirable... The revert still seems 
a better option for now.)

I updated pkgsrc to 4.9.2RC1 (locally) and was going to post the same
thing.

I see the same 4 files, and have:

DATUMGRID_FILES_SAME= ntv1_can.dat ntf_r93.gsb null.lla  nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb

In building the package, the other files are linked into nad/ and those
are checked for being the same.

(I wonder why we don't just add all of these to proj proper and drop the
datumgrid distribution entirely.)


Nits:

  The 4.9.2RC1 unpacked to 4.9.2, not 4.9.2RC1.  The normal expectation
  is that the tarball name and the unpack directory are the same.  But I
  gather the version is not set to RC1 in configure.in.

  NEWS does not mention anything about what's in 4.9.2.   It
  doesn't mention the extra 4 grid files.  It doesn't mention the
  restored proj_def.dat.  It would be good to look at the history and
  spiff up NEWS.

  I found the following changes in the set of installed files:

I'm not sure if these are intended or not; they should either be fixed

That's an entirely reasonable position.  The other is to include all of
them and get rid of proj-datumgrid.


I don't mean to sound complaining; this is why we have RCs.  Thanks for
doing it and I think an RC2 is in order after things are addressed.

How pkgsrc does things is to unpack both proj-datumgrids-1.5 and
proj-4.9.x, and then to ln the datumgrids files into proj-4.9.x/nad.
So the mere presence of files that used to not be present, even if not
installed, causes trouble.

Where are the files that make up proj-datumgrids stored?   Maybe it's
time to put them in proj git and just have them always included.

Hi Howard,

2 issues on MS Windows - though I'm not so sure that either is a "major 
issue".
Firstly there's one test failure for me (with both 32-bit and 64-bit mingw64 
ports of gcc-4.9.2):

PROBLEMS HAVE OCCURED
test file tv_out saved
################################

Those are *not* new failures ... they were present in 4.9.1 (and perhaps 
earlier).
I'm not sure if they've been previously reported.

Secondly, I see that nothing has yet been done about the impasse that 
currently occurs if winreg.h (which typedefs  PVALUE) is included in user 
code that also includes projects.h (which also typedefs PVALUE). See:
http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/273

This was discussed in
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2015-May/007122.html
and ensuing.
I had also raised the same issue previously on the mailing list - I think 
back in 2012, or perhaps a bit earlier. (I haven't dug up up a link to that 
thread - IIRC it didn't contain much discussion of the issue .)

In order to build the PDL (perl) module with proj4 support, I'm therefore 
still having to hack projects.h and pj_param.c to replace the occurrences of 
"PVALUE" with "PROJVALUE" (or some other symbol that doesn't clash).

It's actually a lot easier and quicker to just do the hacks and say 
nothing - as opposed to taking the time to send emails about the issue.
It would therefore be appreciated if either:
a) a fix is implemented;
or
b) a decision is taken to never implement a fix.

Either way, I would then be freed of the task of nagging about it :-)

Cheers,
Rob

PS. The problem with PVALUE affects only 64-bit builds of PDL.
With 32-bit builds, winreg.h still gets included - but there's no problem 
with PVALUE, even though the 32-bit winreg.h also typedefs PVALUE.
Presumably, this difference is accounted for by the pre-processing that 
occurs - ie on 64-bit perls the pre-processing pulls in the typedef, but on 
32-bit perls the typedef is pre-processed away.
I don't see this as having any impact on what needs to be done, but feel 
free to ask for deeper analysis of this difference if it's making you 
uneasy.

Thanks very much!

I've run checks (Fedora 22, current gcc) on this tarball (passes fine) rgdal
itself built against 4.9.2), and on the > 100 packages that declare
dependence (depend, links to, imports, suggests) on rgdal (and use PROJ
through rgdal - here 4.9.2). From a cursory reading of 8 failures, none seem
to be related to PROJ (things like not setting random number seeds, missing
LaTeX packages, etc). Today I'll run the same checks on the root sp package
in the same format and report back.

Roger

PS. A user reports that MacPorts 4.9.1 is affected by the absence of
proj_def.dat - the current rgdal shows more verbose messages. The user
patched it manually:

My opinion is still that we rename it. This just didn't get done as part of this release cycle. Please make a pull request that renames it to satisfy your Windows situation, and it will trigger a Travis build on linux for confirmation.

None of the 8 failures in the rgdal checks were related to PROJ, nor were
any of the few others found in checking sp related to PROJ either (most were
the same as the rgdal issues, they were general issues in the affected
packages). So the 4.9.2 RC is good to go for R.

SOVERSION has been incremented to 10:0:0 in recognition of PVALUE change. Should no more critical issues be identified, I will motion to MetaCRS to make this release final tomorrow.

What to say... We could also have pretended there was no backward incompatible 
change. This change is for a semi-public/semi-private symbol that is very 
likely not used by any external code.

But no ABI breakage. The SONAME stays the same, so no need to rebuild
the reverse dependencies.

Only two new symbols were introduced in 4.9.2 (pj_atof & pj_strtod), and
no symbols were removed. Nothing to worry about for packagers I'd say.

The 4.9.2 release is good for packagers to trigger an update to get the
bugfixes, that hit the R community among others, to their users.

Kind Regards,

Bas

RC2 checks clean for R (as expected, the further changes were orthogonal to
the missing file issue); rgdal and all the packages that depend on it, link
to it, import its namespace and suggest it.

I guess it is insignificant, but from and including 4.9.1 (RCs too), I'm
seeing in config.log:

configure:2397: checking whether build environment is sane
configure:2452: result: yes
configure:2490: WARNING: 'missing' script is too old or missing
configure:2603: checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p

In 4.8.0 (and the unreleased 4.9.0) it was:

configure:2320: checking whether build environment is sane
configure:2370: result: yes
configure:2511: checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p

Thanks for keeping this moving,

Roger

This builds and passes make check on NetBSD 6 i386 under pkgsrc.  The
only difference in installed files from 4.9.1 is proj_def.dat.

There is an incremented soname, which is unfortunate, but I guess that's
unavoidable as technically the renamed PVALUE symbol is an ABI break.

So other than wishing the shlib major change was somehow avoidable,
looks good to me.

A fresh version of that "missing" script is available here (maybe
elsewhere, too):

https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/automake/
--> automake-1.15.tar.xz
     --> automake-1.15/lib/missing

along with
     --> automake-1.15/lib/config.sub
     --> automake-1.15/lib/config.guess

BUT: they differ from
      http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/config.git/plain/config.guess
      http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/config.git/plain/config.sub

which are currently used in PROJ.4.

But PVALUE/PROJVALUE is the name of a structure. Since this is not C++, it
doesn't appear anywhere in the shared library ABI. This is not an ABI
break, it's an API break.

The change was made to Makefile.am, but not Makefile.in (more reason to
avoid those generated files in git), so everyone has been testing against
the old soname.

Pardon me, the tarball has it correct; it's just git that's outdated!

So if someone had compiled against 4.9.1, and installed 4.9.2 (without
the soname bump), all would work ok, as I understand it.  So it's not an
ABI break, and the soname should not change.  The soname major version
should increase if and only if a symbol in the shlib is withdrawn or
there's a significant semantics change.

Still, if there is no actual ABI change, then the soname increment is
wrong and it seems best to undo the Makefile.am and roll another RC.
once it's in a release we're stuck.

master's Makefile.in has indeed not been updated, but I regenerated before I cut the RC2 release. It seems to me to be versioning the library as expected.

I was planning to remove all autogen'd stuff from the repo after the 4.9.2 release.

Do the other maintainers agree with this assessment? I'm happy to set it to whatever satisfies the maintainers given our fact pattern.

The library versioning for the 4.9.2RC2 tarball is correct.

4.9.1 built:

 libproj.so.9.0.0
 libproj.so -> libproj.so.9.0.0
 libproj.so.9 -> libproj.so.9.0.0

And 4.9.2 RC2:

 libproj.so.9.1.0
 libproj.so -> libproj.so.9.1.0
 libproj.so.9 -> libproj.so.9.1.0


Not all then changes from the ChangeLog mentioned at the start of the
thread are actually in the 4.9.2RC2 tarball.

The PVALUE change is only in git, not in the tarball.

git master also bumps the SONAME to libproj.so.10 which I don't think is
required for the PVALUE change.


Another change between git master and the 4.9.2RC2 tarball is the
inclusion of the unused src/hypot.c & src/nad_list.h only in git, not in
the tarball. Those two can probably be dropped from git too.

> I was planning to remove all autogen'd stuff from the repo after the 4.9.2 release.

This is a very welcome change.

Bas

The actual type doesn't change, only the name. This shouldn't affect the
ABI if I'm not mistaken. So I favor reverting back to -version-info
10:0:1, leaving the SONAME at libproj.so.9.

I don't see that

lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       17 Sep 10 14:21 libproj.so -> libproj.so.10.0.0
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel       17 Sep 10 14:21 libproj.so.10 -> libproj.so.10.0.0

and this is consistent with src/Makefile.{am,in} having:

I wonder how you got 9.1.0 from that.

Are you looking at the right link ?

proj-4.9.2/src/projects.h uncompressed from 
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.2RC2.tar.gz does have:

typedef union { double  f; int  i; char *s; } PROJVALUE;

You're using the code from git which has additional changes not
included in the 4.9.2RC2 tarball.

The 4.9.2RC tarball still uses:

 libproj_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined -version-info 10:0:1

But git changed this to 10:0:0 in commit b2d7eebc.

This should probably be reverted to 10:0:1 as discussed elsewhere in
this thread.

Kind Regards,

Bas

For clarification (and because I will never, ever understand libtool versioning), what should the soname be for Proj 4.9.2?

* 10:0:0 (current for RC2)
* 10:0:1 
* 9:1:0

I'm happy to issue a new RC if we need to, but the maintainers need to agree on what the value should be.

Thanks,

Howard

I used the exact same URL to download the tarball used to update the
Debian package.

That was at 16:42:21 CEST/UTC+2 (14:42:21 UTC), the tarball on the
download.osgeo.org was last modified at 16:28:40 GMT/UTC+0.

So someone has been naughty and changed the contents of a published
tarball without renaming it.

You can regenerate the pristine tarball I downloaded from
download.osgeo.org using the pristine-tar utility ( `pristine-tar
checkout proj_4.9.2~rc2.orig.tar.gz`) from the Debian package git
repository:

 http://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-grass/proj.git

Kind Regards,

Bas

10:0:1 should be used in my opinion. This keeps the SONAME at libproj.so.9.

10:0:0 bumps to SONAME to libproj.so.10 which is not required, the
PVALUE change shouldn't break the ABI (the type doesn't change).

Kind Regards,

Bas

I set the version to 10:0:1 and got:

-rw-r--r--  1 root  wheel  504116 Sep 10 17:54 /usr/pkg/lib/libproj.a
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel     990 Sep 10 17:54 /usr/pkg/lib/libproj.la
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 Sep 10 17:54 /usr/pkg/lib/libproj.so -> libproj.so.9.1.0
lrwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel      16 Sep 10 17:54 /usr/pkg/lib/libproj.so.9 -> libproj.so.9.1.0
-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  311075 Sep 10 17:54 /usr/pkg/lib/libproj.so.9.1.0

which looks right.

Looks good here - no need to go hacking projects.h and pj_param.c on Windows 
any more.
Thanks for that, guys.

That looks good - builds, packages and passes make check fine.

With this, I ran make check in postgis2 and that passed.

So from my viewpoint, this is ready for promotion to release.

While the mipsel build results aren't in yet, RC3 is looking good on all
the other architectures. So I also support promoting RC3 to final.

Kind Regards,

I am unclear if I get a vote within the osgeo PSC world, but as the
maintainer of the pkgsrc package for proj, I concur.

Given the motion to MetaCRS receiving a +1 from Frank, I'm declaring this release final.

Just in time for #foss4g, Proj.4 4.9.2 is now released. It is a maintenance release with fixes for four significant issues:

* proj_def.dat was missing from source distribution see https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/274 for more detail
* Update Geodesic library from GeographicLib
* Remove setlocale() use in pj_init_ctx()
* Renamed PVALUE in pj_param.c to prevent clash with Windows

Thanks to all who have helped with testing release candidates and providing guidance on SOVERSION.

Howard

Subject: [Proj] API extension request: fwd3d and inv3d
Message-ID: <D221A2AC.15CB3%Piyush.Agram@jpl.nasa.gov>

Hi everyone,
     I'm trying to include support for a custom coordinate system (SCH – Spherical Cross-track Height) used in radar image processing. The coordinate transform from (SCH) to geodetic / geocentric coordinates is hard to accomplish easily using the current mechanisms available in proj.4 . I would suggest extending the API to include fwd3d and inv3d functions. Presence of these functions can be checked for in pj_transform and in their absence one can seamlessly fall back on the exist fwd / inv functions. Introduction of these new functions will not affect the widely used API and will help make a case for using PROJ.4 / GDAL in public domain radar imaging software.

I have a proof of concept working on a github fork :
https://github.com/piyushrpt/proj.4

Any recommendations / suggestions are welcome.

Thanks
Piyush

Hi,
I download the new proj 4.9.2 yesterday and after compile and install
it on a debain system ,
I see the library are named

libproj  (link)
libproj.so.9 (link)
libproj.so.9.1.0  (file)

the last file "libproj.so.9.1.0" is right name ?

I guess it should be named libproj.so.9.2.0

Thx.

Andrea,

No, it is correct. It is the libtool versionning scheme that has nothing or little to do with the "human" versionning. 

The hard-to-understand rules of the libtool versionning are given here:

It is. The version in the library real name is not the release version.

libtool determines the library version using its -version-info option,
proj-4.9.2 uses -version-info 10:0:1 which results in library version
9.2.0 and SONAME libproj.so.9 (SOVERSION 9). See:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Libtool-versioning.html
https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Updating-version-info.html

Kind Regards,

Bas
