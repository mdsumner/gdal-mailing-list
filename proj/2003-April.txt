Hi Folks,

I've implemented the code for the nad2bin tool but I can't find
the files

	 MD.lla
	 TN.lla
	 WI.lla
	 WO.lla
	 alaska.lla
	 hawaii.lla
	 prvi.lla
	 stgeorge.lla
	 stlrnc.lla
	 stpaul.lla    .

Now I ask how to integrate them.

Bye Alex

Hi Frank,

I've integrated them into the Makefile for the Borland-C 5.5 all runs 
fine. Shall I integrate into my downloadable library ..I think not
you should maintain the code.

A second question.

We want startup writing a free spatial library for Delphi/Kylix 
programmers. Can we apply the PROJ and the ShapeLib code in this
project. Here the link to the source forge:

http://dspatial.sourceforge.net/

Thanks Alex

Radim,

Rather than have a +czech switch specifically for the Krovak projections, and
instead of altering the sign conventions from the "usual", I would like to
introduce a generic mechanism at the pj_transform() level for alternate axis
orientations.

Something along the line of a +axis switch, where "+axis=en" means that
x axis = 'e'ast, and y axis = 'n'orth.  Then a coordinate system string
could specify alternate axis orientations as +axis=sw indicating that
X is a "southing" (or negative northing) and Y is a westing (or negative
easting).  I think this would be the right organization for Krovak right?

My thinking is that this isn't a "projection" issue, but rather at a higher
level a "coordinate system" issue which is why I think it should be handled
by pj_transform() and not effect the low level projections routines.

I would add that Krovak is not the only coordinate system with unusual
axis conventions but this is an area I have been "sweeping under the carpet"
in most of my work in PROJ.4, and OGRSpatialReference, so far.

I would also note that I intend to adopt Gerald Krovak code at some point.

I have no schedule for implementing generic axis support or migrating to
use Geralds Krovak (or simplified libproj).  I will not have time to even
look into this for several weeks.  Thus, for your own purposes you should hack
your local GRASS built in a manner suitable to your needs in the meantime.

I have taken the liberty of cc:ing this reply to the PROJ list where I hope
any discussion of a +axis switch can take place.  GRASS folks might also be
interested as it would presumably be the way that alternate axis orientations
are selected in GRASS.

Best regards,

I'm probably missing something but if you want positive x-y in
the first quadrant why not specify a false easting/northing to
push everthing up and right.  No 'czech' option though.

The mathematical origin is at the shifted pole, up near Helsinki
and the area of interest is south and west of there, thus the
negative values in the natural solution.

That's too simple so I guess I missing something.  :-(

Hi Folks,

I have a probleem with inverse projection.
To test my API in terms of NAN results
use following code:

     Writeln;
 
Writeln('-------------------------------------------------------------------');
     Writeln(' Numeric vaidation test');
 
Writeln('-------------------------------------------------------------------');
     Writeln('..open "+ellps=WGS72  +proj=stere +lon_0=0 +lat_0=0"');
     Proj.Open('+ellps=WGS72  +proj=stere +lon_0=0 +lat_0=0');
 
Writeln('-------------------------------------------------------------------');
     Writeln('srcX [deg] srcY [deg]: destX [m] destY[m] , backX [deg] 
backY [deg]');
 
Writeln('-------------------------------------------------------------------');

     Calc(-180,-180);
     Calc(-135, -135);
     Calc( -90, -90);
     Calc( -45, -45);
     Calc(   0,   0);
     Calc(  45,  45);
     Calc(  90,  90);
     Calc( 135, 135);
     Calc( 180, 180);
     Calc(-180, 180);
     Calc( -90,  90);
     Calc( -45,  45);
     Calc(  45, -45);
     Calc(  90, -90);
     Calc( 135,-135);
     Calc( 180,-180);
Writeln;

and got a strage response:

90 0
25512540.00     -0.00
0 0
0.00    -0.00

If use this pairs in the inverse function I go this
[~ !] invproj +ellps=WGS72  +proj=stere +lon_0=0 +lat_0=0

0.00    -0.00

what is wrong ?


If I use an other projection every thing is fine
..open "+ellps=WGS72  +proj=merc +lon_0=0 +lat_0=0"

Hi folks,

Sorry, a little bit late because since 31 March the version 4.4.7
of geographic projection toolkit proj is out.

Ok here is the new OpenSource Delphi API version
of this toolkit with delphi and cbuilder api's and
the libraries proj447.lib and proj447.dll a new demo
witch containes a simple proj coordinate wrapper
for delphi (in cbuilder it is done). A binary distribution
of the proj.exe, geod.exe, cs2cs, nad2nad, nadgrid for
Windows NT compiled with BCC55 is also available

You can download the stuff freely with source from

http://www.triplexware.huckfinn.de/geogfix.html#proj.

Have fun Alex Weidauer

The ellipsoid inverse for PROJ.4 stereographic does seem to have
a problem in the equitorial and oblique modes.  I will look into
it and hopefully have a corrected version in a couple of days.

One note however, some of the example numbers used exceeded
90d latitude which should induce an error condition.  Also
the antipodal value should also yield an error for stereographic.

(Antipodal: coordinate in the opposite of the earth from
from the lat_0, lon_0 coordinate.)

Hi Gerald,

Ok I've tested it with other proj oringins but was confused by the
results. So I went back to lat_0=0, lon_0=0. I can test it for other 
origins. The aim of my application is to show the usage of proj api
in an animation so I start to calculate NAN conditions for stere
initial origins. I want to create a animation over a moving origin
with a world map and a grid and render the image set.

Thanks Alex

You lost me.  I can understand an animation of shifting origin but
I do not understand the need for the inverse.  Secondly, if the
animation is more-or-less global in extent the spherical form
would seem more appropriate.

None of this excuses the apparent failure of PROJ.4 to do a
proper inverse.

This all brings me back to my recent nemesis: the Gaussian Sphere:
I still have not resolved the differences between Snyder, Thomas,
Pearson, Swiss Projection, Krovak and alternate stereographic.
Some of these folk have elided the constants of integration
and I can't figure out why and what justification was used.
Are there any good mathematical cartographers out there who
have been through this material?

Snyder seems to use the conformal sphere as an intermediate
step in the stereographic but I can' simply match the procedures
with what I have done with the other examples.  AARRRRGGGHHHH!

If you're looking at Equivalent Spheres, an extra bit of heartburn can be
garnered from a perusal of General Jean Laborde's Oblique Mercator of
Madagascar.  The dear general did, in fact, use a constant of integration.
It only took me a week or so (MANY years ago) to duplicate that one with an
HP calculator ...

Cliff Mugnier
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY

You lost me.  I can understand an animation of shifting origin but
I do not understand the need for the inverse.  Secondly, if the
animation is more-or-less global in extent the spherical form
would seem more appropriate.

None of this excuses the apparent failure of PROJ.4 to do a
proper inverse.

This all brings me back to my recent nemesis: the Gaussian Sphere:
I still have not resolved the differences between Snyder, Thomas,
Pearson, Swiss Projection, Krovak and alternate stereographic.
Some of these folk have elided the constants of integration
and I can't figure out why and what justification was used.
Are there any good mathematical cartographers out there who
have been through this material?

Snyder seems to use the conformal sphere as an intermediate
step in the stereographic but I can' simply match the procedures
with what I have done with the other examples.  AARRRRGGGHHHH!

Hi Gerald,

Sorry to arge you about this theme, but I hoped that I got propper
exceptions or overflow remarks will ocour, if the coodinates leaves the 
space of correct or possible  solution. For the stere it is quite simple 
to determin the range of propper coordinate solutions. But if somebody 
use the API  whith no idea of projections, the programmer (in this case 
I) has to prevent the errors by the API.

The inverse is not so mutch relevant for the animation but more for 
other demos or applications, witch have a  cursor over the map image 
that shows both (plain coordinates and longitude latitude coordinates) 
in a status panel and this will fail.

Never than less, thank you for your help.
Regards Alex Weidauer.

The inverse of the stereographic (PJ_stere) seems to be fixed.
How should I forward the corrected routine?

It is for libproj4, and is now v. 2.2 (I started all libproj4
at first level 2). But this particular routine should be
compatible with older PROJ.4 libraries.

Autographed correction is being sent to bug finder.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Reprojecting a point with CS2CS
Message-ID: <000201c30815$c4b382a0$d701a8c0@matt>

Hi,

I am trying to do some coordinate transformations with the cs2s utility.
I think I have the syntax correct, but the accuracy is off (I am using
ESRI ArcView to check the values).  Perhaps my problem is really not
understanding either PROJ.4 or the ArcView application.

My test point is 

Lat/long
GRS80
Unprojected
112.8330W
51.3275N


My first transformation is below:

C:\proj4>type wim.coord
112.8330W 51.3275N
C:\proj4>cs2cs +proj=latlong +ellps=GRS80 +to +proj=utm +zone=11
+ellps=GRS80 <wim.coord
790277.46       5694492.75 0.000

C:\proj4>

I reprojected the same point using ESRI with the following settings:

Category: UTM-1983
Type: Zone 11
Projection: Transverse Mercator
Spheriod: GRS80
Central Meridian: -117
Ref Lat: 0
Scale factor: 0.9996
False E: 500000
False N: 0

And get - 790298,5694496.266518

You can see it is close but not quite on.  Any suggestions would be most
appreciated.

Thanks,

Matt

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] nad2nad bombing
Message-ID: <0HDQ009SUG2GMR@l-daemon>

I have a series of GPS-ed UTM points done in NAD83 datum but the topo charts I have on which to plot them are *old* NAD27 using Clarke ellipsoid.

I tried the following on my linux box to convert. The input file is just a text file of UTM pairs:

$ nad2nad -i 83,utm=10 -o 27,utm=10 -r ntv1_can.dat < /home/jb/docs/birds/NOS/bowron/txt/utm83.txt
Rel. 4.4.7, 31 March 2003
<nad2nad>:
datum file: ntv1_can.dat, failed: failed to load NAD27-83 correction file
program abnormally terminated

The ntv1_can.dat file is in /usr/local/share/proj. I did this last year in June using the then current version of proj with perfect results. Perhaps somebody can show me the errors of my ways. 

Yes, I know I should be using cs2cs instead of nad2nad if I want the ellisoid transform but the difference is within a few metres so it really is not that important on the scale of chart I am dealing with.

cheers,
Jack

Jack,

The nad2nad program only works with the US style datum shift files, not
the NTv1 or NTv2 files.  You will need to use cs2cs for this process;
however, it should not be difficult.  Something like the following
will likely work:

cs2cs +proj=utm +zone=10 +datum=NAD83 \
   +to +proj=utm +zone=10 +ellps=clrk66 +nadgrids=ntv1_can.dat \
   < /home/jb/docs/birds/NOS/bowron/txt/utm83.txt

Best regards,

Works like a charm, Frank. Thanks a bunch. I guess the internals must have changed since a few versions ago cuz nad2nad worked with the ntv1_can.dat previously.

The libproj4 library has been updated to about 135 projections with
Transverse Cylindrical Equal-Area being the most significant addition.
Also revisions to the Internals pdf file have also been made.  For
copies of all this material go to:

Thanks for the info.  I am about half way through the internal
functions with most of the tougher ones completed (except for the
model of a projection routine).

Oops, I already see an error: the Authalic Sphere section should
name pj_auth.c as the file not pj_qsfn.c (which has been removed
from the Makefile list but mistakenly included in the .gz file).

The next release will contain the pj_rtodms function which will
be the library version of the old rtodms with a couple of changes.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Projection parameters for Italian old IGM?
Message-ID: <20030429094553.58e1dacb.bud@sistema.it>

Hello everyone,

I hope someone can help me with what should probably be an easy
question.

For an old series Italian IGM 1:25,000 map, I try to project the map
corners (whose lat/long is known) to UTM (as used in the map).  

I naively tried the following:

proj +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl

and corrected the longitude by hand for the meridian of Rome
(12d27'8.4"E).  But the UTM coordinates that come out don't seem to
be correct.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong and how the projection
should be defined?

Also, if anyone has a numeric example handy for testing...

Many thanks for any help I can get!

--bud

PS.  I found the following information that is probably for the new
series IGM that may shed more light on my problem:

 Transverse_Mercator (ARC/INFO keyword: TRANSVERSE)
 Unità di Distanza Planare: METRI (ARC/INFO keyword: METERS)
 Fattore di scala al meridiano centrale: 0.99960
 Longitudine del meridiano centrale: -3°27'08.4'' per il fuso Ovest / 
                                     +2°32'51.6'' per il fuso Est

The biggest problem for me is the lack of complete information.

1. Italian IGM series? Old or new?  Are they based on UTM?

2. What are the specific geographic coordinates being projected
	and the x-y of the results.  What do you feel they should be?

3. Correcting the longitude of Rome by hand?  Mighty big area to define
	by one point.

4. The "PS" specification is incompleat and possibly redundant but
	Sorry, I can't read Italian so my "translation" may be
	suspect but there seems to be two central
	meridians.  I would guess that "Ovest" and "Est" are west
	and east but no mention of north or south.  Similarly, two
	false westings and eastings?  The description seems incomplete.

Lastly, the zone number of 32 is a little suspect and I would have
chosen zone=33 which would put Roma closer to the central meridian.
Lon 12 is the dividing line between zone 32 and 33.

The following script:
./lproj +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl <<EOF
12d37E 41d52N
EOF
./lproj +proj=utm +zone=33 +ellps=intl <<EOF
12d37E 41d52N
EOF

produces the results:

800183.96       4641382.04
302191.13       4637801.10

The systems being referred to are the old Gauss-Boaga Transverse Mercator
Grid and it is based on the Monte Mario Datum of 1940.  Rome is the Prime
Meridian from whence the two zones are measured.  The scale factor at
origin is 0.9996, but is NOT UTM.  Furthermore, it is oft confused with the
military system used in Italy as specified by NATO which is European Datum
of 1950 with UTM measured from Greenwich.  The latitudes and longitudes are
different - different datums in addition to the grids.

Gauss-Boaga is a specific truncation and has characteristic distortion that
is masked by inadvertent substitution with Gauss-Kruger.  For
survey-quality work it DOES make a difference.  For 1:50,000-scale GIS work
it does not make a difference on land - it does offshore.

The datum shift generally quoted is that found in the NIMA TR 8350.2 (WGS84
Datum) which is ONLY for EU50 to WGS84.  The derivative EPSG database gives
no further guidance.  On occasion the Istituto Geografico Militare in
Firenze (Florence) will give out a 7-parameter transformation for a local
area of Italy, but be careful as they use left-handed rotations.

Most cadastral mapping is still based on the aphylactic Cassini-Soldner
Grids.  Italy has only 540 of them.

So now you know.

The biggest problem for me is the lack of complete information.

1. Italian IGM series? Old or new?  Are they based on UTM?

2. What are the specific geographic coordinates being projected
and the x-y of the results.  What do you feel they should be?

3. Correcting the longitude of Rome by hand?  Mighty big area to define
by one point.

4. The "PS" specification is incompleat and possibly redundant but
Sorry, I can't read Italian so my "translation" may be
suspect but there seems to be two central
meridians.  I would guess that "Ovest" and "Est" are west
and east but no mention of north or south.  Similarly, two
false westings and eastings?  The description seems incomplete.

Lastly, the zone number of 32 is a little suspect and I would have
chosen zone=33 which would put Roma closer to the central meridian.
Lon 12 is the dividing line between zone 32 and 33.

The following script:
./lproj +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl <<EOF
12d37E 41d52N
EOF
./lproj +proj=utm +zone=33 +ellps=intl <<EOF
12d37E 41d52N
EOF

produces the results:

800183.96       4641382.04
302191.13       4637801.10

Hi Gerald,

many thanks for responding.  Here some more information  (below)

What the map states (translated from Italian) is the
following:

The kilometric grid is in the UTM system using the European Data
(Datum?) of 1950.  

It further states that the projection coordinates printed on the map
are UTM, zone 32, international ellipsoid.  


> 2. What are the specific geographic coordinates being projected

The geographic coordinates printed on the map are relative to the
international ellipsoid "orientato"  (how do I translate this?) to (or
at?) Rome (Monte Mario).  (I suppose this is the prime meridian?)

The longitude of Rome, M.Mario is 12d 27' 08".04   

The longitudes printed on the map are "west of the meridian of Rome
(Monte Mario)".  

For the values that I expect, see below...

> 3. Correcting the longitude of Rome by hand?  Mighty big area to define
> 	by one point.

The longitude seems to be pre-defined in proj4, as, for example, in
-pm=rome.  So I thought the term "meridian of Rome" was defined.

Yes, there are two zones (fuso in Italian), one West (Ovest in
Italian) and one East (Est in Italian) which use different central
meridians.  

> I would guess that "Ovest" and "Est" are west
> 	and east but no mention of north or south.  

Yes, for the zones.  So no need for north and south...

> Similarly, two
> 	false westings and eastings?  

Yes, referring to the two zones (West and East), respectively.

> The description seems incomplete.

What is missing?

I didn't mention that the map is of Tuscany, a little west of Rome...


Here the values that I expect:

for 1d 07' 30" west of the Rome Meridian (12d27'08".04) and 43d 0' 0"

the UTM coordinates should roughly be (read from a georeferenced
raster map) 

E=1689760.45  
N=4763707.54

Note that this is different from Gauss-Boaga.  The map actually prints
the Gauss-Boaga coordinates of that corner that are:

E=1689710
N=4763529

so some 200 meters off

I hope this defines the problem better.  Again, many thanks for your
help!

Thanks, Clifford, for answering.  I don't believe that the projection
of the map I'm working with (possibly as opposed to what I stated in
the PS. of my post).  is Gauss-Boaga, however.  At least the grid
printed on the map is stated to be UTM, zone 32, international
ellipsoid and European Datum of 1950.  While the longitudes printed on
the map are west of Rome (M.Mario), that should not affect the
projection (unless I misunderstand something here).   

Actually, the map prints the Gauss-Boaga coordinates of the map
corners and they seem to differ from the desired UTM coordinates in
the range of about 200 meters.  (For numbers, see my other response to
the list).  

All this applies to my actual problem with an old series 1:25000 IGM
(the Italian mapping agency) map.  What you said may well apply to the
more detailed data that I listed in the P.S. of my post.  (Although
I didn't think so--but obviously I must go wrong somewhere...).

many thanks and I hope the additional information in the other reply
to the list allows to find a solution!

cheers

The variety of names for the Transverse Mercator projection creates
a hideous problem.  Are the names merely nationalistic pride or do
they merely represent different datums/prime-meridians or are they
computationally different?  From my point of view I am only concerned
about how they are computed and leave datums/prim-meridians to others.

+tmerc in the libproj library uses the equation set based upon
Thomas' "Conformal Projections ..." page 97.  This version has a
few more terms than Snyder's Working Manual, page 61. I take it that
the Boaga-Gauss has elided a few more terms.

The question now becomes should I add another version of tmerc
with the truncated evaluation similar to what was done with the
French version of the conformal conic?  And call this the "boaga"
projection?

The following is copied from
http://remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/transverse_mercator.html
and is basically a copy of Snyder's version.
Easting, E =  FE + k0*[A + (1 - T + C)A3/6 + (5 - 18T + T2 + 72C -
	58e'2)A5/120]	
Northing, N =  FN + k0{M - M0 + *tan*[A2/2 + (5 - T + 9C + 4C2)A4/24 + 
	(61 - 58T + T2 + 600C - 330e'2)A6/720]}
This is lumped with other discussions that include the Boaga projection
and thus implying that it defines the Boaga projection.

Is this true??

Thank-you from confused on Cape Cod.

Hi Gerald,

Adding Gauss-Boaga may be a nice thing.  I'm not a specialist of
Italian projections (I'm really doing this to sort something out for
my wife and haven't done any GIS work in Italy for years).  

The best info I found to check on how Gauss-Boaga works is probably
with the Geographic Transformation Engine project
(http://www.mondogis.it/open/gte/doc/gteinfo.html).  They have some
sample scripts to convert from Gauss-Boaga to UTM (bottom of
http://www.mondogis.it/open/gte/doc/gtescript.html) but the links seem
to be broken. ....fixing links.....downloading....

The following GTE script converts from geographic coordinates on WGS84
to Gauss-Boaga zone West:  WGS84-GBO.xml  (attached)

I hope this is useful to confirm that what you found below is correct.  

I'll try to get hold of an article that describes the Italian
georeferencing systems better--but that may take some days to
materialize...

best cheers

Hi Gerald,

again thanks for the help.  I made a mistake in the coordinates that I
wrote, adding a 1 in front since I thought it was a typo.   Sorry for
that.   So I try to be more precise on this.  (Now installing proj on
my machine...).

So the coordinates that I would like to have are:  (long is west of
Rome-M.Mario of 12d 27' 8.4")

1d07'30"  43d00'00"           >>>    689760.45     4763707.54
1d07'30"  42d55'00"           >>>    690021.52     4754462.74
1d00'00"  42d55'00"           >>>    700210.22     4754751.94
1d00'00"  43d00'00"           >>>    699948.89     4763999.07

So trying the last two points in Greenwich long run through
proj +proj=utm +zone=32 +ellps=intl:

11d27'8.4" 42d55'00"           
yields                    700169.30     4754564.18
but should be about       700210.22     4754751.94

11d27'8.4" 43d00'00"            
yields                    699899.19     4763819.04
but should be aobut       699948.89     4763999.07

You see that the numbers are in the UTM range.  The map quite clearly
states that the grid is UTM 32 on the intnl. ellipsoid, so there
shouldn't be any doubt there.  And also the lat/long refers to the
same ellipsoid.  The projection talks about the European Datum of
1950--no information what datum is used for the lat/long....

Could there be a datum shift to consider???  Any clue where I'm going
wrong?

Again, many thanks for your help.

My current suspicion is that the lat/long coordinates based on the
intl. ellipsoid "oriented to Rome, M.Mario" may mean that the datum is
rome40  ????  (I found some possibly related ?? material on the Internet
that used Rome40...)

Could the problem be that I need to convert from rome40 to European
Datum of 1950?


many thanks

And I just got more evidence that my suspicion below is correct:  I
just received two articles that describe the Italian reference systems
and one of them states that the long of Rome,M.Mario in the Rome40
datum is 12d27'8.4" while in the European Datum of 1950 it is
12d27'8.933".  Bingo...

So it seems I have to figure out how to change the datum from Rome40
to ED50...

Just a note, I think that 'top' usually is not precisely 'north' and
sometimes may be very different azimuth, so it may be confusing.
I would prefer 'left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom'.

Copy of PROJ.4 was removed from GRASS (5.1) and added as a new dependency.
That means that I have to hack my local PROJ.4. I can do that, but other users?

So again I would prefer if you could apply my patch for PJ_krovak.c
for now. PJ_kocc.c and +axis is good long term solution.

I don't want positive x-y in the first quadrant, I want negative 
x-y in the fourth quadrant. 
I thing that PJ_kocc.c returns what I need (I did not manage to compile
it in PROJ.4 or GRASS). 
I was talking about PJ_krovak.c, currently present in PROJ.4 and 
it returns positive values (but not switched axis).
AFAIK +x_0/+y_0 cannot switch sign/quadrant.

In PJ_kocc.c, not in PJ_krovak.c.

Radim,

The left, right, top and bottom are the X and Y axes, but to relate these
to world coordinates we need something else.  I use north, south, east and
west because that is the way of labelling the directions in all projections
familiar to me, even when the "northing" isn't exactly due north.  So, no
I won't talk about left, right, top and bottom in the +axis.  I would note
that my terminology for axis labelling is also based on the OpenGIS model
for describing axes, which I hesitate to diverge from.

As for incorporating the +axis it is some ways out.  It is likely you will
need to make PROJ.4 patches available to users that want to use your (or
Geralds) Krovak module as I don't intend to release (another) intermediate
solution.  With all respect to the Czech nation, I don't feel the projection
is widely used enough to cause alot of people problems.

Best regards,
