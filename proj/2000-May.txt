Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] geod API?
Message-ID: <000101bfb444$c5c856c0$649b77c6@larc.nasa.gov>

Has anyone wrapped the geodetic distance calculations in geod with an API?
I'm just starting to use the PROJ system, and can't find any .ps or .pdf
documentation that mentions the geod program; and while the PROJ library is
doing a great job, I'm also interested in the ellipsoidal geodetic distance
calculation that geod uses.

Thanks much,
-dave

I have to admit that when I put *geod* into PROJ.4 it was kind of a
throwaway
item.  Lot'sa people wanted geodesic distances to I included it.  The
algorithm
used is not very good but good to a cm or two at most large distances.
Also,
the algorithm is a horror mathematically.

I recommend the geodesic procedure available from the Nat'l Geodetic Survey
as I believe it to be more accurate and certainly cleaner mathematically
(although it is recursive).  They have a FORTRAN version which very cleanly
converts to C with f2c.

Dear PROJ community,

find attached a forwarded mail from the GRASS
developers mailing list. Currently there is the
idea to implement datum shift into GRASS for
GPS data conversions etc. GRASS offers already
raw support. In case you are interested, please
let us now. [Andreas, hope you don't mind the
forward]

Sidenote, if you don't know: GRASS 5 is using the 
latest PROJ4 code (thanks, Frank!).

I am interested in keeping somewhat abreast of PROJ.4 usage but except
for the NAD datum conversions, I don't have much experience in this
specialized field.

I had lost track of GRASS shortly after CERL's demise.  I guess it has
been kicked around between several institutions.  Is MAPGEN still
a part of it?  Just curious.

Perhaps you can advise us in specific problems later!

Since 1998 the GRASS development is coordinated by "GRASS Development
Team" headquartered at University of Hannover (Germany) and Baylor
University (Texas) with support of GMS Labs/University of Illinois
and contributions of many people worldwide. It is worth looking at it!

MAPGEN is not part of the standard distribution any more, but
we have the code on our server in an extra package (currently
unmaintained).

Find it all here (choose nearest server):
http://www.geog.uni-hannover.de/grass/
The Baylor site is linked, the mirror sites as well.

Kind regards

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] datum shift 
Message-ID: <392C06FA.5C0739FD@Rhein-Main.de>

Hi,

i have some questions relating to the different datum shift formulae.
I would be glad if someone could give me an answer or a pointer for the
world wide web.

What is the difference between the Bursa-Wolf transformation and the
(3d) similarity transformation? On some web-pages theses terms are used
interchangebly, others imply that there are different
formula/parameters.

What is the difference between the Molodensky transformation and the
"abridged Molodensky" transformation. I only found the description of
the Molodensky transformation on Peter H. Dana's excellent webpages
(http://www.utexas.edu/depts/grg/gcraft/notes/datum). 

Thanks a lot in advance,

Andreas
