Subject: [Proj] Transformation of rotation
Message-ID: <NoA.6ZJs.4VUjEDVy1RZ.1I9kqs@seznam.cz>


Hi I want to transform rotation in XY (one angle) from one coordinate system
to another (JTSK -> WGS84). I'm want to transform text, defined by origin, 
scale and rotation (angle around z axis). Transfrom scale from one system to
another is not a problem, but how can I transform rotation. I know that 
transformation includes different projections, so its not going to be 
accurate (i would have to transform text definitions too). But partial 
solution is fine.

Hello,

use 7 parameter datum shift - that include rotational parameters for each axis

in proj.4 you use towgs84 statement to define any datum shift.

These shift parameters are applied to the axis at the center of the 
earth, and not on the surface where we normally use plane projected data 
in metres.

Hello,

a simple plane rotation theta can be done using the following
formulas for each point:

xx = x*cos(theta) - y*sin(theta);    // xx after, x before
yy = x*sin(theta) + y*cos(tjeta);    // yy after, y before

Under proj 4.7.1, if I input   0 0    to

invproj +proj=omerc +no_rot +lat_0=33 +lonc=-116 +alpha=45 +ellps=WGS84

I get     116dW   33dN   as output. However, doing the same for proj4.8.0
gives

I've been using proj for some time; this has me baffled. (I should note
that the inverse and forward are consistent in both versions).

proj 4.7.1 was installed on Mac OSX 10.5, 4.8.0 on MacOSX 10.8
installed from MacPorts

Duncan,

We have been through a morass with oblique mercator and it's different
forms over recent years, and I'm afraid I don't recall all the details.
There is some discussion at:

  http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/104

I observe that you get the old results if the +no_rot flag is omitted:

invproj +proj=omerc  +lat_0=33 +lonc=-116 +alpha=45 +ellps=WGS84
0 0
116dW    33dN

I think at least part of the issue had to do with where the +no_rot flag
was interpreted relative to but I'm not inclined to investigate deeply.
Ticket #104 has points to some other tickets that might help.

It might be nice for us to prepare an FAQ entry explaining the changes and
when they came into effect if someone can summarize simply.

Best regards,
Frank

Talking of omerc projections, I still have this ticket from GDAL open 
about loosing the given +no_uoff or +no_off parametres:

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4910

It seems that the problem was solved in GDAL 1.10 for Malaysia 
projections, but up to now not for Michigan. I'm not sure if it is a 
Proj or GDAL related bug.

Hi all,

After the success of last years workshop, we decided to hold the
Pytroll workshop this year again at SMHI.

Pytroll is a collection of free and open source python modules for the
reading, interpretation, and writing of weather satellite data.
The provided python packages are designed to be used both in R&D
environments and in 24/7 operational production. More info at:
www.pytroll.org

This time, it will be a two days introductory workshop, during which
we will present the different packages of Pytroll, and help you get
started with the installation and the different applications you might
have.

Preliminary program:
Day 1:
- - Presentation of the different pytroll components
- - Installation of pytroll on the participants' computer
Day 2:
- - Illustration with different test cases and/or user defined
applications brought by the participant.

Please tell us if you plan to attend, so we can plan effectively.

For any more information, have a look at last year's workshop's webpage:
http://www.pytroll.org/workshop2012.html
or contact us with any questions directly or on the pytroll googlegroup.

Best regards,
Martin

Hi List,

I've encounter the following question in gis.stackexcange [0] which is a
bit theoretical and interesting.

It has to do about coordinate shifting between gdal and two other
commercial applications and I am too wondering whats happening.

I would be very interested If someone could provide an insightful answer on
what is happening

I'm trying to transform a WGS84 lat/lon point

11d42'32.10629" E 5d12'56.75371" S

in three different software packages (Proj4, GeoTrans and Leica GeoOffice)
but I receive very big differences between the results - around few hundred
meters in X and Y! Note that these variations appears only with 7
parameters not with 3.

*Proj4*

cs2cs +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +to +proj=utm
+zone=32 +ellps=clrk80
+towgs84=178.3,316.7,131.5,-5.278,-6.077,-10.9792,-19.166 +south +units=m
+no_defs

------------------------------

*GeoTrans*

Delta X 178.3
Delta Y 316.7
Delta Z 131.5
Rot X -5.278
Rot Y -6.077
Rot Z -10.9792
SF = -19.166 / 0.999980834 (0.000019166)

------------------------------

*Leica GeoOffice*

Screenshot: http://imgur.com/cOTRuQB
------------------------------

The results are respectively:

   1. 800392 9422525
   2. 800306 9422840
   3. 800941 9422891

I believe all the 3 packages use same mathematical methods for 7-param
transform (Bursa-Wolf method). What could be the cause of this huge
variation?

The differences could be the "sense" of the rotation angles.  Consider changing the signs and see what happens ...
