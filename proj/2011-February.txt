Subject: [Proj] English translation of Helmert, Geodesy, Vol. 1
Message-ID: <19784.29019.790315.462855@puffin.sarnoff.com>

I have obtained the ACIC translation of

  F. R. Helmert,
  Die Mathematischen und Physikalischen Theorieen der Hoeheren Geodaesie
  (Mathematical and Physical Theories of Higher Geodesy),
  Vol. 1 (Teubner, Leipzig, 1880)

and have posted a scan of it at

  http://geographiclib.sf.net/geodesic-papers/helmert80-en.pdf

(The translation is a work of the US Government, so it's not covered by
copyright.)

Notes:

* The table of contents and the cross-references in the text use the
  page numbers from the original book.  This pagination is indicated in
  the translation by the numbers above and below the horizontal lines in
  the text.

* The formulas have been cut and pasted (in the old-fashioned way!) from
  the book.  In some cases these are barely legible.  Go to the German
  text to disambiguate these; see
    http://books.google.com/books?id=qt2CAAAAIAAJ

* This PDF has 949 pages.  However, the scan is perfectly legible when
  printed 2-up (2 pages per sheet).  This should work OK with A4 and US
  letter sizes.

Subject: [Proj] large difference while projecting utm to utm back and forth
Message-ID: <20110216131950.200930@gmx.net>

Dear list,

I know, I should not do it but I have to :-(
Given is a point 600000 east and 8260000 north in utm zone 35.
I have to project this location to utm zone 30.
Doing some calculations I have to project this value back from 
zone 30 to zone 35.
But I get differences of about 3km east and more than 200m north.

Those are the steps I made using cs2cs:
cs2cs +proj=utm +zone=35 +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84
600000 8260000
1451785.04      8532758.68 0.00

and the way back:
cs2cs +proj=utm +zone=30 +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=utm +zone=35 +datum=WGS84
1451785.04      8532758.68
597050.49       8260246.21 0.00

Can anyone describe a way to achive the startvalues?

Best regards

Christoph

P.S.
I use proj 4.7.1 and the latest from svn.

  Hello Christoph,

I might be wrong but I'm afraid it is not simply possible. In my 
experience with Transverse Mercator
formulas (not with cs2cs)  they are ill-posed when you get far from the 
central meridian.
In your case you have 5 zones difference, which is 30 degrees.  In other 
words transformation
is just not defined when you get so far.

It would work if you have points at the border of the zones, say 30 and 
31, but
35 is way far.

Best Regards,
Mikhail

Christoph,
 
For that much of a zone extension, you need to have additional terms in the classical expansion, say, to the fourteenth derivative for  ±24°of the Central Meridian; - or - use the closed form with nested iterative loops as now implemented in ESRI software.  Most people don't use that because of the extreme convergence angle between Grid North and True North is counter-productive for large-scale mapping.  If it's not large-scale (1:50,000 or larger), why use UTM?

I agree for what may be the "basic" TM in Proj.4, however Proj.4 does have 
more than one of the Scandinavian implementations of TM that are robust far 
from the TM.  Search for and use one of those and you'll get better 
round-trip closure.  -Noel

Noel:
I assume you are talking about the "Engsager Extended Transverse Mercator"
(etmerc) implementation, written by my colleague Karsten Engsager. With
Karsten's approval, I submitted that implementation to Gerald Evenden a few
years ago. This was followed by one or two other similar "wide
field"-transverse mercator implementations, which were all integrated into
Gerald's original proj library, but I do not think it ever made its way into
Frank's version.

Christoph:
I could dig out the Engsager source code with my modifications for
proj-compatibility, if you are interested. Integrating it into Frank's proj
version should be fairly straightforward, and you are most welcome to do it.
I just haven't had spare time to do it and submit a patch yet.

Thomas,

I agree - I don't see that any of the wide field tmerc implementation
made it into my PROJ.4.  If someone (ideally Gerald) could identify a
preferred implementation I'd be willing to port it over or apply a
patch if someone else wants to file a ticket with a proposed change.

Best regards,

Frank, I have just been on a journey through my mail archive and have found
a personal email from Gerald with his timing and roundtrip-precision tests
of the different wide field transverse mercator implementations. My
interpretation of his results is that the Engsager implementation sits in
the sweet spot between speed and precision. I will forward the material
(including source code) to your pobox.com address in a few minutes.

For a remote sensing project using Google Earth imagery on the border

Saudi  maps on the other side of the border. I have searched in many 
places on the Internet and found little data of help.

I also need to know if the UTM grid based on the International 1924 
ellipsoid also appears on these maps in addition to Ain el Abd datum 
latitudes and longitudes.

The NGIA 3 parameter transform constants to and from WGS84 from 1991 
at 9 stations is rather outdated.  Are there 7 or 12 
parameter  transform coefficients available anywhere?

A brief explanation or Internet links will be greatly appreciated.

Dear list,
 
first of all I am happy that I did not do anything wrong :-)
And as I mentioned in the first mail, I know, that utm is not
the best way to transform coordinates in that way.
But I am working on a map scale of 1:50000 and have to use
utm coordinates. Those are the rules :-(
 
I am using proj for while and I do not want to miss it anyway.
But I'm not sure how to proceed. From my point of view there
could be a chance to extend proj with some "wide field tmerc
implementations". And afterwards it would be possible to do
the transformation in the very northern area with a higher
accuracy.
Can anyone tell me how this work will be done? May I help in
anyway?
 
thanks
 
Christoph

P.S. There seems to be a problem with the gmx-mailservice which

Hello,

why do you have to project to the other UTM zone?

Why not keep them in the first zone all the time and not
to loose accuracy? Or if you have to project to another
projectio can't you just choose a better one?

Regards: Janne.

Christoph,
Why, if I may ask, do you HAVE to use UTM.  Whose rules?  If your work 
requires you to span 5 UTM zones, shouldn't you be questioning the "rules"? 
Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC) is a better choice of projection for east-west 
extents.  You may be lucky to eventually get access to etmerc to span these 
UTM zones without algorithmic error, but those with whom you share your maps 
or computations may not be so lucky.  There may be disagreements.  But 
everyone has access to an appropriate LCC.

Dear list,

first of all I am happy that I did not do anything wrong :-)
And as I mentioned in the first mail, I know, that utm is not
the best way to transform coordinates in that way.
But I am working on a map scale of 1:50000 and have to use
utm coordinates. Those are the rules :-(

I am using proj for while and I do not want to miss it anyway.
But I'm not sure how to proceed. From my point of view there
could be a chance to extend proj with some "wide field tmerc
implementations". And afterwards it would be possible to do
the transformation in the very northern area with a higher
accuracy.
Can anyone tell me how this work will be done? May I help in
anyway?

thanks

Christoph

P.S. There seems to be a problem with the gmx-mailservice which

Dear Noel, Janne, and all other,

I am working on a map which must be in UTM coordinatesystem.
And while constructing the utm-grid over the area I don't have
any problems - in the resolution used - to transform between
positions from zone 34 to zone 30 and back.
Only if i extend the area so the zone 35 is also covered, I
get this large delta while projeting from zone 35 to 30 and
back.

@Janne I'm contructing the grid. And while doing so I have to
project several points from the _real_ zone to the 'base' zone.

Subject: [Proj] Create a new customize projection
Message-ID: <14219908.636181297948167272.JavaMail.root@wmail16>

Hi to all,
i have a question for you. I'd like to create a new projection that is a 
acustomization of a mercator projection. I'd like to create a new projection 
like this "+proj=newmerc" where i set some new parameter and formulas. Can i do 
that? What i need to modify? i try to copy and paste  PJ_merc.c with a new name 
PJ_newmerc.c and insede the code i change like that:

#define PJ_LIB__
#include        <projects.h>
PROJ_HEAD(newmerc, "NewMercator") "\n\tCyl, Sph&Ell\n\tlat_ts=";
..
i recompile all with make and make install.
I try to run proj -l but i can see newmerc.

can anybody help me?

Thanks


Francesco

Francesco,

Make sure you have added your new file to the Makefile.am, rerun automake,
and also that you have added your new projection in pj_list.h.

Message-ID: <AANLkTinaDAqQDjL3xfWRFNzA=K6V2=3wa5RUZ7c2WybL@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, we had issues displaying data from epsg:31370
We changed some "-" signs, according to a definition that i found in
postgis, and that solved the issue.
We use Rel. 4.7.1, 23 September 2009.

The parameters that  showed us the expected result were:
<31370> +proj=lcc +lat_1=51.16666723333333 +lat_2=49.80333339 +lat_0=90
+lon_0=4.367486666666666 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl
+units=m

+no_defs <>

The minus signs and the versions in the several packages in which proj4 is
included is getting me a bit dazzled, so i might be mistaken.

Hope this is constructive.
Cheers,

WBL

Message-ID: <ECE789FDEE455A45BBA735E53A7A21380368A5EA@exp1.lgb.local>

Hello all,

I just downloaded proj.4.4.6 as a windows prebuilt executable, which
appears to be slightly older than the source code version 4.7.0.

I'm experiencing similar problems as described in
http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2011-January/005509.html:
Using a cs2cs command line like 

> cs2cs +proj=latlong +ellps=clrk66 +nadgrids=ntv2_0.gsb +to
+proj=latlong +ellps=GRS80 +datum=NAD83

(with the ntv2_0.gsb properly installed and all environment variables
set, including debug) the first coordinates I enter (or just pressing
enter with no input) result in the message

pj_open_lib(ntv2_0.gsb): call
fopen(C:\users\Downloads\PROJ.4\proj446_win32_bin\nad/ntv2_0.gsb) -
succeeded
*        * 0.000

and the next coordinates I enter give wrong results or zeroes.

Trying other NTv2 grids led me to believe that they are just ignored:
the resulting coordinates do not change when I - for example - enter a
wrong filename for the +nadgrids option. In that case, I get an error
message, though.

I suspect this all is because the windows version of PROJ.4 is a bit
old. Since I have no knowledge or tools to build it myself, is there a
place where newer versions of PROJ.4 are available as an executable
build?

Any suggestions or other causes for this problem would also be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance
Norbert

Message-ID: <20110218075622.145380@gmx.net>

Dear list,

with help of Thomas Knudsen, thanks again, I was able to extend the
local trunk version of proj with 'etmerc' from libproj4.3. The errors
I reported in earlier mails are gone :-)

So, what I want to know is, how is it possible to include this
projection in the main proj4 source?

Best regards

Christoph

Christoph ,

why do you have to go all the way back to zone 30?

Why not first convert the base zone to zone 33
example? And do it from there? That way it
would stay within reach. Or even better, why
not convert the whole base zone to LCC and
stay accurate all the time?

I hope this helps?

Christoph,

I have filed a ticket with the implementation from Thomas.  I will try
to incorporate it in trunk today.  If you can offer a clean patch to
incorporate it against trunk that would be convenient - please feel free
to append it to the ticket.

   http://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/97

You will need an OSGeo Userid to login to the ticket system.  See:

   http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid

Best regards,

Norbert,

More recent PROJ.4 binaries are included in a number of software
distributions including OSGeo4W, FWTools and likely MS4W.

   http://osgeo4w.osgeo.org/
   http://fwtools.maptools.org/
   http://www.maptools.org/ms4w

It has been some time since I last build standalone binaries for PROJ.4
for the download site.  If someone wished to contribute a recent build
I could put it on the download site.

Best regards,

Hello,
I think your parameters are nearly right, but not quite:
the last number you have is -1, but it should be -1.2747.
(Maybe this doesn't make a great difference in the results.)

Apart from the this, your +towgs84 parameters agree with
the datum shift "BD72 to WGS 84 (3)", EPSG:15929 (except 
that yours have more decimals).

Background: I think the Belgian authorities published this
datum shift in the opposite direction (from WGS 84 to BD72),
which somehow made it into the proj/nad/epsg file.  That's 
why you had to reverse so many signs.  

Also, the Belgians published the last number, not as a 
scale difference in ppm, but as the scale factor 1.0000012747.
It appears that this factor has been rounded to 1, and interpreted
as a scale difference in ppm by proj/nad/epsg (and by postgis too), 
but it really corresponds to the scale difference 1.2747 ppm, 
or -1.2747 ppm if you go from BD72 to WGS 84.  

A further problem is that EPSG has published an erroneous
version of this datum shift, EPSG:15749, where the scale
difference had the wrong sign. That version was deprecated
by EPSG in March 2007 and replaced by EPSG:15929.

Hi, we had issues displaying data from epsg:31370 
We changed some "-" signs, according to a definition that i found in postgis, and that solved the issue.
We use Rel. 4.7.1, 23 September 2009.

The parameters that  showed us the expected result were:
<31370> +proj=lcc +lat_1=51.16666723333333 +lat_2=49.80333339 +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.367486666666666 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +units=m +towgs84=-106.868628,52.297783,-103.723893,0.336570,-0.456955,1.842183,-1 +no_defs <>

The minus signs and the versions in the several packages in which proj4 is included is getting me a bit dazzled, so i might be mistaken. 

Hope this is constructive.
Cheers,

WBL> Has it been fixed in the latest version of proj4 (the epsg file)? 

Not quite fixed. In the trunk, http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/proj/trunk/proj/nad/epsg , 
I found the entry

# Belge 1972
<4313> +proj=longlat +ellps=intl +towgs84=-106.869,52.2978,-103.724,0.3366,-0.457,1.8422,1.2747 +no_defs  <> 

where the last number has the wrong sign (should be -1.2747).  

There is a geotiff ticket on this error, http://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/ticket/32 .
(I believe the datum shifts in the Proj.4 epsg file are generated 
 from the libgeotiff csv files.)

	Subject: [Proj] [proj4] epsg:31370 possible wrong parameters
	


	Hi, we had issues displaying data from epsg:31370
	We changed some "-" signs, according to a definition that i found in postgis, and that solved the issue.
	We use Rel. 4.7.1, 23 September 2009.
	
	The parameters that  showed us the expected result were:
	<31370> +proj=lcc +lat_1=51.16666723333333 +lat_2=49.80333339 +lat_0=90 +lon_0=4.367486666666666 +x_0=150000.013 +y_0=5400088.438 +ellps=intl +units=m +towgs84=-106.868628,52.297783,-103.723893,0.336570,-0.456955,1.842183,-1 +no_defs <>
	
	The minus signs and the versions in the several packages in which proj4 is included is getting me a bit dazzled, so i might be mistaken.
	
	Hope this is constructive.
	Cheers,

Message-ID: <4D62931B.4090204@pobox.com>

Folks,

I have included the extended transverse mercator code discussed earlier in
PROJ.4 and it will appear in version 4.8.0 when released.  Anyone wanting to
try it in the meantime can do so from trunk.

Hello,

"SWEREF99 18 00" is EPSG:3011.
Google Map uses the CRS that EPSG calls "WGS 84 / Pseudo-Mercator", which is EPSG:3857.
So, using ogr2ogr, I think you can convert your park.shp file into a googlepark.shp 
by the command

> ogr2ogr -t_srs EPSG:3857 -s_srs EPSG:3011 googlepark.shp park.shp 

But I haven't tried it. 
(I think you could omit the "-s_srs EPSG:3011" from the command if you 
 had a park.prj file, which would tell ogr2ogr the CRS of the park.shp.
 But it seems you don't have any park.prj file.)

Subject: [Proj] Middle Europe projection setup problem
Message-ID: <4D64EB16.4040201@dopti.hu>

Hello!

I use Mapnik with openlayers and postgis database. I have an osm map
from hungary and another hungary map in the postgis/postgresql
database.
When I visualize the maps in my browser i get the following
maps/pictures. See below:
Hungary OSM map:http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/4318/hungaryosm.png
My other Hungary map:http://img7.imageshack.us/img7/2817/hungaryroad.png

My problem is that the projection isn't good enough, because Hungary is 
"thicker" or "higher". My map (not the osm map) is in WGS84 projection, 
and I use this in my mapfile:

<Map srs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs"

...

<Layer srs="+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs">


I think that the view center of my map is by the 0.0 (lat) and 0.0 (lon) 
coordinates, that's why my maps are "thinner" than on other maps.
Is that really my problem? What should i change in my settings?

Thank you for your help!

If I understand you right, I think your problem is just that longlat 
(or Plate Carrée) isn't a good projection for map display (except near 
the equator). Longlat will show one degree of longitude to be as long
as one degree of latitude, but since the meridians approach each other 
away from the equator (and meet at the poles), that's not true in general. 
At the latitude of Budapest, one degree of longitude is about 75 km, 
but one degree of latitude is about 111 km. 

Perhaps you can try using

<Layer srs="+proj=utm +zone=34 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs">

I have a shapefile with native projection "SWEREF99_TM" EPSG:2006 and i have
converted its projection to EPSG:4326 by ogr2ogr. The conversion was
successful, but when i compare the original shapefile with newly generated
file, there was a difference in width, the new file streatches in width.
Then i bublish this shapefile on Geoserver and tried to display it over
google map (by writing some code using Openlayers API). But the Layer could
not display. The important point to note is my code works with other files
published on Geoserver.

I dont know where is exact problem, Can anybody help, where is problem ?

Mustafa,

EPSG:2006 is St. Lucia 1955 / British West Indies Grid.

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-62 +k=0.9995000000000001 +x_0=400000
     +y_0=0 +ellps=clrk80 +towgs84=-149,128,296,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs

SWEREF99_TM appears to be EPSG:3006 which can translate effectively as
UTM 33.

    +proj=utm +zone=33 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs

I think you just messed up your numbers.

When writing to the PROJ.4 list it is also helpful to address your
question in terms of PROJ.4 not the many other software packages you
have mentioned.

Personally, I use this for SWEREF99 TM:

"+proj=tmerc "                  // Projection
"+ellps=GRS80 "                 // Spheroid
"+k=0.9996 "                    // Scale factor at central meridian
"+x_0=500000 "                  // False easting
"+y_0=0 "                       // False northing
"+lon_0=15.0 "                  // Longitude of central meridian
"+lat_0=0.0 "                   // Latitude of origin
"+towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 "       // Datum
"+no_defs"

This results in near perfect matches with the reference data published
by the Swedish Survey Authority. See
http://www.lantmateriet.se/upload/filer/kartor/geodesi_gps_och_detaljmatning/Referenssystem/kontrollpunkter_sweref99tm.pdf

See http://www.lantmateriet.se/templates/LMV_Page.aspx?id=4219 for a

English version before but do not see it now.

Thanks for replying! 

I have already tried with EPSG:3006, but i mentioned in the post as
EPSG:2006 wrongly. I have tried again with EPSG:3006, but the result is
same. i.e it streatches in width.

any more suggestions?

Mustafa,

Well, "stretches in width" is not telling me much.  Features will have
different shapes in different projections.  Is there some reason to believe
what you are seeing isn't just normal for the projections in question?

You haven't given any details on the extents of the data in source or
destination so we can't even try to evaluate if you are using an appropriate
area for the region of your data.

You aren't giving enough information to get good information, and it turns
out the only actual information you gave in your first post was wrong and
led me on a wild goose chase.

Best regards,

I recommend the version of Geod that is included with GeographicLib,

  http://geographiclib.sf.net

Here's what it gives for this problem:

echo -12.4989444 130.88649687 -12.4989444 130.8864967 | Geod -i
-90.00000002 -89.99999998 0.018 0.018

The man page is available at

  Hello list,

I came across a small inconsistency in the geod program. What I use is:

geod +ellps=WGS84  -I -f "%.3lf" data_file

With data file:

-12.4989444 130.88649687 -12.4989444 130.8864967

What I got is:

-1.#IO  -1.#IO  -1.#IO

These two points are very close to each other however are not identical.
I would
not be surprised if geod would return 0 0 0. If fact this is what it
does if points
are simply identical.  I would suggest to round result to 0, even if it
is not but say
smaller than some reasonable number (0.01 m?)

  I hope this would help to improve great proj software even more.

Thank you,

Mikhail

Mustafa,
I don't know why EPSG:3011 could not be processed by ogr2ogr.
But you could try to supply an explicit definition to ogr2ogr.
For example, at http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3011/proj4/ 
you find a proj4 definition, which ogr2ogr should understand:

> ogr2ogr -t_srs EPSG:3857 -s_srs "+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=18 +k=1 +x_0=150000 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=m +no_defs" googlepark.shp park.shp

I am sorry, this is my fault. Thank you for explanation.

Mikhail,

The proj list would be a better place for this question.

pj_init_plus() will allocate a new PJ object and there should
be a corresponding pj_free() call for each successful call to
pj_init_plus().

I am not sure what lead you to a different conclusion.
