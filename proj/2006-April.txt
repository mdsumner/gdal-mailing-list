Hi, List!

A try to compile proj 4.4.9 on my Solaris 9:

My only reason for responding to this problem is to express
amazement at the persistance of carrying over a feature in
the old (and unsupported on my part) proj library that I am
sure nobody is using: the Chebychev bivariate approximation
procedures.  This was used by the long defunct MAPGEN
program and is only of interest in speeding up projections
in large scale applications with graphic quality resolutions.

These functions have been trimmed out of libproj4 and
not part of the program lproj.

I darkly remember that optimization can cause problems.

FWIW, only yesterday I generated/downloaded a file in mapgen format from
the NOAA coastline extractor:

  http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/shorelines.html
  http://grass.ibiblio.org/grass61/manuals/html61_user/v.in.mapgen.html

so the beast is not totally dead? (could just be an output filter, but
then again Mapgen format is the default..?)

Subject: [Proj] Problem loading grid shift file
Message-ID: <20060410044405.1148.qmail@web50811.mail.yahoo.com>

Hi,

I'm using PROJ 4.4.6 (March 2003). The problem I have is that when I
enter the following command string from cs2cs (rel 4.4.7 31 March 2003)
it works however doing the same via the pj_transform() command in the
proj.dll gives me an error message of "failed to load NAD27-83
correction file".

cs2cs +proj=latlong a=6378160.0 +rf=298.25
+nadgrids=A66_National_13.09.01.gsb +to +proj=latlong +a=6378137
+rf=298.257222

What is the difference between using cs2cs and pj_transform(). And what
are rules governing how PROJ4 finds the grid shift files ? I have
placed my (Australian) *.gsb file in the same directory as the exe file
of the program I'm testing and also in C:\PROJ and in C:\PROJ\nad. The
program cannot find it wherever I seem to put it!

Here's the strings I'm using to create the source and target projection
objects for use with pj_transform():

m_PJSource = pj_init_plus("+proj=latlong +a=6378160.0 +rf=298.25
+nadgrids=A66_National_13.09.01.gsb");

and

m_PJDest = pj_init_plus("+proj=latlong +a=6378137.0 +rf=298.257222");

Then calling:

pj_transform(m_PJSource,m_PJDest,1,1,&dX,&dY,&dZ);

Where dX, dY are doubles containing lat/long coords converted to
radians and dZ=0.0. (These are defined double dX,dY,dZ;)

Where am I going wrong ??

Thanks,
Anthony.

Don't worry about this problem. I switched to using a new version of
the proj.dll and all is fine.

Anthony,

I didn't see any problems with how you were calling pj_transform().  The
grid shift files should be searched for in the directory pointed to
by the PROJ_LIB environment variable.  If that environment variable is not
found it should default to a builtin directory, often c:\PROJ\NAD.

If you define the PROJ_DEBUG environment variable (to YES for instance) you
should see some debug output in the console indicating where PROJ.4 is
searching for the files.

You can also use the pj_set_searchpath() function to define a list of
directories to search.

By the way 4.4.6 is a bit old now.  You might consider upgrading to 4.4.9.
Some of the above mentioned functions may not exist in 4.4.6.

Best regards,

Subject: [Proj] 4.5.0 Beta Release
Message-ID: <44471385.5070603@pobox.com>

Folks,

With encouragement from Norman Vine and others I've produced a beta
for a 4.5.0 release of PROJ.  While the "leap" to 4.5.0 from 4.4.9 might
suggest substantial improvements, in fact changes are relatively minor
though it does include an EPSG 6.9 upgrade.  However, the way I represent
versions in proj_api.h, producing a 4.4.10 doesn't work, so 4.5.0 we have.

Despite my promises to Gerald back in January, I haven't yet gotten to
work on remodelling things to use libproj4 as the projections library
with everything else as layered services.

Let me know if there are any problems with this beta.  If not, I'll issue
a 4.5.0 official release shortly.

Folks,

I found a few of the changes I had made with regard to handling
EPSG prime meridian translation were wrong, so I have issued a
PROJ.4 "Beta 2" with an updated epsg file.

In addition to fixing up some prime meridian stuff, this file also
includes "(deprecated)" after the comment for coordinate systems
deprecated by the EPSG.  This is often because errors were found though
they aren't always serious errors (ie. could be a spelling error in name).

   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.5.0b2.tar.gz
   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj-4.5.0b2.zip

The "beta 1" has been removed.

Subject: [Proj] m.proj module added to GRASS 6.1-cvs
Message-ID: <20060422215532.52d441e5.hamish_nospam@yahoo.com>

Hi,

I have (finally) written for GRASS 6 the replacement m.proj2 from GRASS
5.
Same name and functionality, totally different code.

I've called it m.proj. It's a shell script front end to PROJ.4's cs2cs
utility, can read data from stdin or a file, and output to stdout or a
file. There are easy switches (-i and -o) for the common task of
converting to/from WGS84 LL and the current GIS map projection.

e.g., to turn a lon/lat coord into a projected vector map:
G61> echo "170.54321 -45.98765" | m.proj -i | v.in.ascii output=tmp_point

For me it is quite useful. There is probably a bug or 3 in a corner
somewhere, so please test and for now use with care.

It's in CVS now:
  http://freegis.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/grass6/scripts/m.proj/m.proj?rev=HEAD

Here's the help page:
  http://grass.itc.it/grass61/manuals/html61_user/m.proj.html

[dev note: help page doesn't show up on the "misc modules" help list?]


I would be grateful if someone wiser in the ways of PROJ4 could have a
look at that help page and check for errors, especially in the EXAMPLES
section where it talks about using custom projection paramters. I wasn't
sure what was GRASS 5's modified proj quirks and what were PROJ4's.

+towgs84=a,b,c counts as a de facto +datum= declaration, and so datum
transform always happens if it's used, correct?


enjoy, and thanks in advance for any fact checking,
Hamish

Subject: [Proj] [Newbie] Conversion from wgs84 to tmerc
Message-ID: <444CB72A.2080506@gmx.net>

Hi folks,

I'd like to convert wgs84 coordinates from all over Europe to tmerc
(Gauss-Krueger).

According to David Vaz' posting "cs2cs how to use" (posted on Feb. 15,
2006, [1]) it is not that easy to convert?!

> You cannot go directly from WGS84 Datum coordinates to a projection (tmerc)
> on another Datum without FIRST performing a Datum Shift.


Searching the web, I found the following information [2]:

> I got the same problem as Harald Wehr when tranforming from wgs84 to
> Gauss-Krueger (zone 4).
> I use cs2cs as follow
> cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel
> +lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +x_0=4500000 +towgs84=583,68,399

Presumably, this applies (to a certain part of) Germany!?

My questions are:
how can I determine lon_0 (central meridian) and x_0 (left shift) for 
many different locations in Europe? All I have are the geographic 
coordinates and the geographic coordinate system. E.g.:

ID|GeographicCoordinateSystem|Longitude|Latitude|CountryID
1|"WGS84"|9.183132|53.904484|DE
2|"WGS84"|6.764922|38.33335|ES

Roland,

It's rather difficult to answer such an all-encompassing question regarding
"how to transform everything to WGS84."  The U.S. Military has NOT done it,
and you're not likely to do it either, unless you are addressing a very
loose accuracy criterion for thematic mapping purposes.  For those areas of
the world that the U.S. Military & NGA needs to "go in," they do not
normally rely on existing maps but use National Technical Means to map the
area of interest with new brand-new imagery that is already 'on' WGS84.

That's why the TR 8350.2 document (still available for download from NGA)
is now considered obsolete and is not a document used for operational
readiness surveying and mapping.  You can use that document with its tables
of transformation parameters for individual countries and regions, but the
accuracy of the possible transformations depend largely on the quality of
the classical geodetic networks surveyed before WWII with theodolites and
invar chains and wires.  (Not anywhere as good as GPS does nowadays.)  The
tables of transformation parameters in TR 8350.2 are derived from empirical
observations of existing triangulation stations in various parts of the
world.  The result is a piecemeal solution with discontinuites across
classical triangulation chains, it is based on a two-dimensional Helmert
transformation on the complex plane from all the local native datums and
grids of Europe before WWII to the European Datum of 1950.  The accuracy is
good enough for combat operations in hitting targets within the blast
radius of indirect artillery fire using 1:50,000 scale topographic military
maps.  It is NOT better than that.  It is NOT good enough for cruise
missile targeting or GPS-guided munitions.  That's why TR 8350.2 is
obsolete.

The EPSG/OPG/APSG tables are similar in geodetic provenance and reliablity.

For thematic mapping objectives, I suppose what you want to do is possible,
but will definitely be a grand pain in the behind to implement.  (The U.S.
and NATO militaries gave up trying it.)  For large-scale geodetic
applications or cadastral applications, it is impossible without your own
fleet of low-orbit satellites with digital cameras and a network of
download Earth stations.

Sorry, but it's easier said than done.

Hi folks,

I'd like to convert wgs84 coordinates from all over Europe to tmerc
(Gauss-Krueger).

According to David Vaz' posting "cs2cs how to use" (posted on Feb. 15,
2006, [1]) it is not that easy to convert?!

> You cannot go directly from WGS84 Datum coordinates to a projection
(tmerc)
> on another Datum without FIRST performing a Datum Shift.


Searching the web, I found the following information [2]:

> I got the same problem as Harald Wehr when tranforming from wgs84 to
> Gauss-Krueger (zone 4).
> I use cs2cs as follow
> cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel
> +lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +x_0=4500000 +towgs84=583,68,399

Presumably, this applies (to a certain part of) Germany!?

My questions are:
how can I determine lon_0 (central meridian) and x_0 (left shift) for
many different locations in Europe? All I have are the geographic
coordinates and the geographic coordinate system. E.g.:

ID|GeographicCoordinateSystem|Longitude|Latitude|CountryID
1|"WGS84"|9.183132|53.904484|DE
2|"WGS84"|6.764922|38.33335|ES

Any hint appreciated.

TIA,
Roland R.

Message-ID: <f8fe65c40604250148n51bd1f6fr@mail.gmail.com>

Dear PROJ.4 developers,

trying to build proj-4.5.0b2 I found out, that there is nothing new
with Krovak projection. As I know Radim's patch [1] has not been
implemented yet...

Please, see bugreports

http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1133

and

http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=147

I am sorry for disturbing you but it is really *frustrating* for Czech
and Slovak users who use PROJ.4 in connection with GIS software
(GRASS, QGIS, UMN MapServer, etc).

I have tried to modify Radim's patch for version 4.5 and write another
patch which adds new option '+czech'.

krovak.c.patch (Radim's original patch modified for 4.5)

echo "15 50" | proj +proj=krovak
-703105.69      -1058219.60

krovak_czech.c.patch (+czech)

echo "15 50" | proj +proj=krovak
-703105.69      -1058219.60

echo "15 50" | proj +proj=krovak +czech
703105.69       1058219.60

I hope this problem will be finally solved...

Best regards,

Martin Landa

I do not know what mr. Rickborn is trying to achieve, but it is of course
also conceivable to stay on the WGS84 ellipsoid and to do a universal
transverse Mercator (UTM) projection.
Let the projection code calculate what the nearest central meridian is,
merely based on the input of the longitude of each point.
But: can (lib)proj do that?
For UTM the false easting is a fixed value.
Another problem could be the special V (Norway) and X (Svalbard) UTM-zones.
They are irregular.

Martin / Maciek,

I hear your pain.  It was my intention not to do another PROJ release
till I dealt with this issue, but then pressure on the meridian issues
forced by hand.   My intent is to resolve this by adding arbitrary
axis orientation flags for the coordinate system definition rather than
have an assortment of variations of projection names for different
orientations.

Best regards,

No worries. Just bugging you to keep the issue alive :).

Dear all,

I have taken liberty to open a PROJ related chat channel
on IRC (Internet Relay Chat, an online system of
communication, [1]).

You can reach the channel here:
 irc://irc.freenode.net/proj

If you need some short intro, please take a look at
http://grass.gdf-hannover.de/twiki/bin/view/GRASS/HowToIRC
where I have briefly explained things for the GRASS users.
But it also applies to the #proj users of course.

IRC is useful to quickly resolve issues.

Best Regards

 Markus
