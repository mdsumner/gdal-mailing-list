Hello all

being unfamiliar with cartographic projections, I hope I won't bother
you with too naive questions.

I have to process together data of different nature and sources:
    * satellite (landsat ETM) data, geocorrected (level 1G) , delivered
in UTM projection and unspecified ellipsoid -in which case I assume
WGS84
    * data given in latitude/longitude for WGS84
    * data from ground based stations, delivered in the local
co-ordinate system, in my case (former East Germany):
                             Projection: Gauss Krueger in 6° stripes (or
Transverse Mercator)
                                 projection parameters: central meridian
15E false northing 3,500,000m
                              Ellipsoid: Krassowsky with Pulkovo Datum
(dX=28, dY=-130 dZ=-95)

then come my questions:
-up to version 4.3, proj was restricted to projections only, within the
same ellipsoid/datum system. It seems that the newer version -and
program cs2cs- is able to do the job. Am I right, or is cs2cs also
restricted to one ellipsoid at a time?

-to check my results I was provided with some checked remarkable points,
which co-ordinates are known in lat/long and in the local system.
I was never able to find these results with proj/cs2cs
Example:
"ground truth": geographical, WGS84: 52.4172632N 13.6254409E becomes
y=3406605m x=5810804m on GK/Krassowsky etc

The command
cs2cs  +ellps=WGS84 +proj=latlong +to +ellps=krass +proj=tmerc +lon_0=15
+x_0=3500000
gives me approximately the same figures, yet slighty different:
y=3406478.97   x=5810764.06 (difference is 40m in x and 126m in y)

-although this difference might be sufficiently small for my application
I would be glad to know if it is normal or much too large, in comparison
to cartography standards
-the difference in x and y looks very much the same as the Pulkovo
datum. I'm not sure of the meaning of this datum: is it a shift from
Krassovsky ellipsoid or from WGS84? In the first case, how can I tell it
to cs2cs, and in the second case, why the same cs2cs command with datum
specified as +towgs84=28,-130,-95
gives me absurd results (e.g. x=3500000.00  y=10002137.50)

-last but not least, wanting to check my command before bothering you,
I've asked for more info with option -v, and look at what is said about
ellipsoid:
(with above cs2cs command, option -v added)
# ---- From Coordinate System ----
#Lat/long (Geodetic)
#
# +ellps=WGS84 +proj=latlong
# ---- To Coordinate System ----
#Transverse Mercator
#       Cyl, Sph&Ell
# +ellps=krass +proj=tmerc +lon_0=15 +x_0=3500000
#--- following specified but NOT used
# +ellps=WGS84

how do I have to understand the last comment?

Many thanks for your help

Jean-Paul Berroir

PS: I'm using the proj package version 4.4.4 on a lunix i686 machine

Jean-Paul,

I get the same problem, and I have found it is a botched change I made
to the Convert_Geodetic_To_Geocentric() routine in September.  As far as
I can tell this will always screw up any conversion from geodetic to
geocentric.   I have correct the geocent.c file and now I get values close
to your reference position, but still off by 12 meters.  I am assuming this
is due to the +towgs84 transform being only an approximation of the correct
transformation.

I have committed the fixed geocent.c, and also place it at:

   ftp://gdal.velocet.ca/pub/outgoing/geocent.c

I would appreciate your trying the fix and verifying things are OK for you.
I think I had better issue a PROJ.4.4.5 soon since this is a very serious
flaw in the datum shifting support.

Best regards,

Jean-Paul,

I forgot a few items.  You should use +datum=WGS84 instead of +ellps=WGS84
in your definition.

eg.

./cs2cs -v +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84 +to +proj=tmerc +ellps=krass     

                       +lon_0=15 +x_0=3500000 +towgs84=28,-130,-95

PROJ.4 defaults to appending +ellps=WGS84 in some cases.  This comment is
essentially telling you that this defaulted ellipsoid was ignored.  It isn't
a problem.

Thank you Mark
I've tried your fix and as you say, the results agree with reference
points by less than 12 meters -even less with other points-, which is
more than enough for me.  And more, the +towgs84 specification now has a
normal behavior

many thanks again -  and happy new year (with version 4.4.5?)

Regards

Jean-Paul

Message-ID: <3C3C5904.6030409@pobox.com>

Folks,

Pursuant to the terrible bug with datum shifting (excepting the NAD27/83
conversions) I have issued a new PROJ release with the fix.  It can be
found at:

   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/proj/proj-4.4.5.tar.gz
   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/proj/proj-4.4.5.zip

The ChangeLog contains the following notes since the 4.4.4 release.

2002-01-09  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* src/geocent.c: Fixed serious bug in Convert_Geodetic_To_Geocentric()
	that essentially ruins all datum shifting (except NAD tables).  This
	bug was introduced just in time for the PROJ 4.4.4 release.


2001-11-05  Frank Warmerdam  <warmerdam at pobox.com>

	* src/proj.def: added pj_strerrno and pj_errno as per request from
	Bernhard Herzog.

Best regards,

Hi Frank,

As a sanity check that I've built the Debian package correctly, I always
run a few simple commands and check that the ouput is identical to what
prior versions of proj produced.

For example:

$ cat > /tmp/test.dat
-65   49
-65.1 49.1
99    99
-66   49
-66   49.1
^D

$ proj +proj=lcc +lat_o=48.5 +lon_0="-62.5" -m 1:111120 -f '%.5f' /tmp/test.dat
-1.66309        51.62829
-1.72670        51.73125
*       *
-2.32805        51.65025
-2.32415        51.75131

Prior to this version, I always obtained a different output of:
-1.66314        51.62596
-1.72676        51.72892
*       *
-2.32812        51.64792
-2.32423        51.74899


Is this a reflection of the fixed bug?  Or is something wrong?

Many thanks!

Peter,

This is a function of the default ellipsoid now being WGS84 instead of clrk66.
If you do the same, but add +ellps=clrk66 you will get your old answers.  I
thought this changed before 4.4.4.

Børge,

I don't have a visual studio project for you, but here is a simple program
for converting from lat/long to utm.  The example demonstrates the modern
api. On Unix I can build the program like this:

% gcc -I/usr/local/include ll2utm.c -o ll2utm -lproj

ll2utm.c:

#include "proj_api.h"

int main()

{
     projPJ	src, dst;
     double	x, y;
     int         pj_err;

     src = pj_init_plus( "+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84" );
     dst = pj_init_plus( "+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84" );

     while( scanf( "%lf %lf", &x, &y ) == 2 )
     {
         if( pj_is_latlong( src ) )
         {
             x = x * DEG_TO_RAD;
             y = y * DEG_TO_RAD;
         }

         if( (pj_err = pj_transform( src, dst, 1, 1, &x, &y, NULL )) != 0 )
         {
             printf( "pj_transform: %s", pj_strerrno( pj_err ) );
         }
         else
         {
             if( pj_is_latlong( dst ) )
                 printf( "%.8f %.8f\n", x * RAD_TO_DEG, y * RAD_TO_DEG );
             else
                 printf( "%.3f %.3f\n", x, y );
         }
     }
}

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] PROJ4 and ISIN (MODIS) wish
Message-ID: <20020129201553.L22545@itc.it>

Hi,

the MODIS data from TERRA mission are delivered in a sort
of unusual projection:
 Integerized Sinusoidal (ISIN) projection

"The ISIN projection is unique to the MODIS land products, analogous to the
Sinusoidal projection except that the ISIN projection is centered about 0°
longitude and special coefficients are used to flatten the ellipsoid."

MODIS Reprojection Tool Distribution

I would like to know if there is a chance to add ISIN to PROJ4.

Background:

 Today I managed to compile a tool to import MODIS data into GRASS. However,
 this is currently done in image coordinates. The ISIN boundary coordinates
 of the MODIS maps are delivered, so it would be great to be able to use
 r.proj of GRASS (which utilizes an older version of PROJ4) to reproject
 the MODIS/ISIN to another projection.

 Above mentioned MODIS Reprojection Tool is generally working and writing
 for example UTM in GeoTIFF, but not for the interesting 250m MODIS data
 products. For these data another tool is available which needs IDL (I
 don't want to buy a license, sorry).

 As workaround I got "select_vNsds" running on my linux box which generates
 binary file from HDF (convenient for r.in.bin). Only remaining problem is
 that I cannot set up an ISIN projection in GRASS due to the PROJ4
 limitations to directly import MODIS into an ISIN GRASS location.

Above mentioned MODIS Reprojection Tool is coming with a modified
GTCP package where ISIN is added:

/******************************************************************************
NAME                           ISINFOR.C
 
PURPOSE:    Integerized Sinusoidal Library Functions - library routines to
            perform mapping to and from the Integerized Sinusoidal.  These
            functions perform the mapping from geographic coordinates
            (longitude/latitude) to the map projection coordinates (x/y).

/******************************************************************************
NAME                           ISININV.C
 
PURPOSE:    Integerized Sinusoidal Library Functions - library routines to
            perform mapping to and from the Integerized Sinusoidal.  These
            functions perform the mapping from projection coordinates (x/y)
            to the geographic coordinates (longitude/latitude).

As the tool is provided by USGS it should be public domain. So the code
adapted might be allowed without reimplementing everything (?).
Then GRASS would be one of the first GIS supporting ISIN :-)
Unfortunately I am not able to "hack" the PROJ4 to support ISIN...

Of course I will publish the GRASS module for MODIS (and also ASTER) import,
when things are working. 

Comments are welcome,
