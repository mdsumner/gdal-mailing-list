Boris, 

If you are distributing this as a library, you might want to override how
pj_open_lib.c locates PROJ_LIB.  Using an environment variable may be
cumbersome.  If you are interested let me know and I will add a function
the application can call to set the PROJ_LIB location at runtime.  This
would be useful in some of the environments I use PROJ as well.

Correct.  The grid shift files are not platform independent.  They are
byte order sensitive and also sensitive to structure packing alighnment
since some structures are dumped "whole" to the file.  I would like to make
these binary files platform independent at some point in the future.

Correct.  The use of emess_data is not thread-safe.  Furthermore, I 
wouldn't trust the library to be fully re-entrant in other ways either.

Of course, if you protect all calls into the library at your higher level
api and capture error information within the protected session things
should be fine.

I am not sure I follow this.  It is true that PROJ.4 wasn't originally 
conceived as a shared library, but I have been using this way for some time.
The emess_dat structure is initialized by emess.h in emess.o.  Further 
initialization should only be necessary if you want to set the program name
or other parameters for more meaningful error messages.  Am I missing 
something here?

I've found several places where static variables are used to communicate
information between procedures.  That will fail when called from
different threads. The three I recall are in pj_init.c, pj_param.c, and mk_cheby.c.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Gauss-Krueger to WGS 84
Message-ID: <3B2E1729.8F7A667B@onestepahead.de>




Hi,

I am writing a program to convert EDBS files (containing geographic
data)
into Mapinfo files. The coordinates are given in Gauss-Krueger and have
to be
converted into WGS 84. Example: zone:4558589320 right: 572748 top:
553027
I have read that there are only 5 zones for Gauss-Krueger coordinates,
but I
have got a little more: 45587222 ; 45589120 ; 45589219 ; 45589220 ;
45589221
; 45589318 ; 45589319 ; 45589320 ; 45589321 ; 45589420

Is it possible that the diversity of zones is only 18 ; 19 ; 20 ; 21 ;
22 and
the first six digits are standing for some other information?

In the archive of this newsgroup I have found the following syntax to
convert
from Gauss-Krueger into WGS 84   I have not realy understood how to
bring
together my data with this, especialy the zone-information.

"proj -I +proj=tmerc +a=6377397.1550000003 +es=0.0066743720\
  +lat_0=0.0000000000 +lon_0=$bezug +k=1.0000000000 +x_0=$ans
+unfact=1.0000000000"

Please answer in simple English or German, thanks a lot :).

Ilja, 

I don't know how to related the values you have (like 45589319) to a 
coordinate system; however, the list of coordinate systems common in 
Germany can be found at:

  http://www.geocities.com/CapeCanaveral/1224/prj/prj.html

If you find that one or more of these is what you need, it should be
possible to use the proj form you show in your email - perhaps which
slight tweaks depending on ellipsoid. 

Good luck,

Hi,
I'm using the following form to convert from Gauss-Krueger to WGS 84 and
it works.

"proj -I +proj=tmerc +a=6377397.1550000003 +es=0.0066743720\

My Problem: How I can get decimal output instead of degrees
(16d7'31.85"W     3d50'42.613"N)?
There is a -f option for output, but I havn't found the right arguments
for it.

Ilja, 

The -f parameter takes "printf" style arguments.  Try adding `-f "%.10f"' to
your command switches for decimal degrees with 10 decimal places of accuracy.

Paul, 

The "proj" program can translate from lat/long to projection coordinates
or from projection coordinates to lat/long.  To get projection coordinates
to lat/long use the -I (inverse) commandline switch. 

The cs2cs program can go from any supported coordinate system to any
other supported coordinate system. 

Reprojecting Shapefiles requires additional software to read and write
the shapefiles, and call the appropriate proj functions.  It turns out there
is a "shpproj" program distributed with my Shapelib (in the contrib directory)
built on PROJ.4.  With that program you can reproject shapefiles fairly
easily .... at least I assume so, I haven't used it myself. 

 See http://gdal.velocet.ca/projects/shapelib

Good luck,

Paul, 

There is a datum, and an ellipsoid of this name.  I am not properly trained
in these matters, but the ellipsoid is the shape of the earth, normally
expressed as a major and minor axis, and a datum is a model of various earth
irregularities and survey errors. 

WGS84 is a common ellipsoid/datum.  For use with PROJ.4 you would use
this to set the +ellps or +datum parameters after having defined all your
other projection parameters.  

The material at the following URL seems like a good overview of datum issues.

Hello All,
I wish to thank all of you who have kindly provided me with the links and
documentations
on the WGS-1984. One fact that clearly came out is that I was looking at the
wrong places.

The term seems to be rather common with GPS. Again, thank you all for the
support.

Best regards,
Paul.
