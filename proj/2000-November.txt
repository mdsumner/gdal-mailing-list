OSSIM, PROJ.4 and Geotiff folks,

I am having a problem getting results of the VanDerGrinten projection in
PROJ.4 to match the results from OSSIM (with projections code derived from
Geotrans from NIMA).

Projection definition (in OSSIM terms):

ossim_image.meters_per_line:  60.000000000000000
ossim_image.meters_per_sample:  60.000000000000000
ossim_image.projection.projection.central_meridian:  -117.474542889
ossim_image.projection.projection.datum:  NAS-C
ossim_image.projection.projection.false_easting:  0.000
ossim_image.projection.projection.false_northing:  0.000
ossim_image.projection.projection.type:  GrintenProjection
ossim_image.tie_point_x:  -17789.435662079999020
ossim_image.tie_point_y:  3914051.301389410160482

OSSIM's GrintenProjection results:

Upper Left:  lat: 33 54.22N lon: 117 38.47W
Lower Right:  lat: 33 37.51N lon: 117 18.48W

Results using PROJ.4:

Corner Coordinates:
Upper Left  (  -17819.436, 3914081.301) (117d38'27.48"W, 33d52'5.27"N)
Lower Left  (  -17819.436, 3879401.301) (117d38'27.06"W, 33d35'23.38"N)
Upper Right (   17820.564, 3914081.301) (117d18'29.19"W, 33d52'5.27"N)
Lower Right (   17820.564, 3879401.301) (117d18'29.61"W, 33d35'23.38"N)
Center      (       0.564, 3896741.301) (117d28'28.34"W, 33d43'44.59"N)

The PROJ.4 and OSSIM results for the top left corner are different by
roughly 2 minutes in latitude ... far exceeding what might be expected
from simple numerical errors.  Interestingly the OSSIM results very closely
match results from EASI/PACE which uses code derived from the FORTRAN GCTP
package. 

Looking into the OSSIM/Geotrans code, I see a "spherical radius" is computed
from the major and minor ellipsoid axes, and is used later, using this
formula:

    Ra = a * (1.0 - es2 / 6.0 - 17.0 * es4 / 360.0 - 67.0 * es6 /3024.0);

My supposition is that this projection is being done based on a spherical
approximation for the earth, whereas I gather PROJ.4 actually does the 
calculation based on an ellipsoidal model.  Does people believe this to be
true? 

A few questions:
 o Is the approach to computing "Ra" above a standard method?  Should I get
   equivelent results if force PROJ.4 to use a spherical earth model with the
   same value as generated above? 

 o Is there an easy way of finding which GCTP and Geotrans projection suffer
   from this approximation? 

 o Is there a reason why NIMA (and the USGS for GCTP) consider it acceptable
   to use spherical approximations for some of these projections?

 o How are those of us (like myself) trying to achieve data interoperability
   between different systems supposed to handle these problems?  

 o Are there good venues (I mean online, not conferences) for discussion of 
   issues like this?  

 o Are GCTP and/or Geotrans like to change the way they handle this (and other
   spherical projections)?   Is there someone we can contact to encourage them?

I have directed replies to osrs-proj, as it seems like the best venue for
followup discussions.

Van Der Grinten is a spherical only projection.  If PROJ is used and no
specs are given for radius then a is used (e2 is ignored).  I suspect that
the problems arise due to errors (or/of omission) of specifing radius.
GCTP only has it in spherical form also.  I have never seen an ellipsoidal
development for it and rather doubt that one exists.

In PROJ, R_A specs radius of sphere of equivalent area of selected
ellipsoid.  The formula for Ra given below is used by PROJ for R_A.

Regarding "spherical approximations for some of these projections" I can
only add that many projections formulas are *only* derived for the spherical
earth.  Because of the nature of usage (usually in small scale maps) there
is
no point in ellipsoidal developments.  Ellipsoidal usage is *only* of
interest in large scale mapping,  grid systems and geodesic work.

Going back to Van Der Grinten, its main claim to fame is being used
for the Nat'l. Geographic Society seal and occasionally for a global
map.  Personally, I think there are a lot better global representations
(mainly pseudocylindricals).

Interesting, in the OSSIM specs below it only mentions some datum
but never mentions radius.  Projections *do not* care about datums.
*Only* ellipsoid specs or radii.

Brian, 

The proj command translates between projection coordinates (in a defined
projection), and geodetic coordinates in the same datum/ellipsoid.  So 
what are you wanting to translate to/from WGS84/Geodetic?  

If you need to do datum shifting there is experimental support for that
in the new cs2cs program.  Let me know if that's what you need.

Hiya!

Thanks for the quick reply!!

We are trying to translate lat/long pairs (in degrees) to x,y coordinates
(in feet) to be used by our 3D Graphics environment.

This is our current setup:

	char longMerd[20];

	if (point._long > 0.0)
		sprintf(longMerd, "+lon_0=%de", (int)point._long);
	else
		sprintf(longMerd, "+lon_0=%dw", (int)abs(point._long));

	char *args[] = {"proj=utm", "ellps=clrk66", longMerd};

	_projection = pj_init(3,args);

      for(;;) // all points to project
	{
		UV projectCoords;

		projectCoords.u = DEG2RAD(point._long);
		projectCoords.v = DEG2RAD(point._lat);
		projectCoords   = pj_fwd(projectCoords, _projection);

		x = projectCoords.u
		y = projectCoords.v
	}

This is working great except now we have some images that we are drawing
paths on that are in the WGS84/GEODETIC projection.  We would like to just
change out the projection to use this projection instead of Clark 1866.

Brian, 

Technically you are just operating in a different ellipse, not a different
projection.  You should use "ellps=WGS84" instead of "ellps=clrk66" for WGS84.
A full list of supported ellipses can be extracted from the proj commandline
program with the -le switch.

Alan, 

Are you really doing this at a DOS command window?  I found a similar problem
on Unix, but the problem went away when I removed the single quotes (the 
minutes markers).  This is because on Unix like shells the single quotes is
interpreted by the shell as containing a constant string, and so the following
+lon_1/2 is absorbed into the preceeding argument to the problem and lost.  
The single quotes can also be escaped with a backslash if necessary (for
instance, if you want to have seconds as well). 

However, I was unable to reproduce the same problem at the DOS prompt, since
DOS has very different (and generally simpler) quoting and commandline parsing
rules.  Perhaps you are using Cygwin?  If it really is DOS, perhaps you should
still drop the single quotes. 

On a related note, I discovered that with my version of the Microsoft C/C++
libraries, the strtod() function used to convert DMS values to decimal values
is treating strings like "44d15" as an expoential value (ie 44 x 10^15). 
This completely screws up results of course.  

How did you build your copy of geod.exe?  Are you using MSVC++?  What version?

I see that proj comes with a separate copy of strtod() though it doesn't
appear to be linked in by default.  I think I will change things to use it by
default, and to rename it to proj_strtod() or something similar.

All I can say is: "huh?"  The last I looked, geod does not have "+lat_1=
..." arguments.
All data to be converted are obtained from either sysin or files specified
on the runline!
Secondly, it would appear that the inverse (point to point distance) is
desired but
neither "invgeod" execution name nor -I argument are employed.

Try:

geod -I +ellps=WGS84 +n_S=20 >output.txt <<EOF

EOF

Note: in Unix execution form.

Gerald,

This paragraph is from the geod man page.  I certainly didn't add this
functionality!  However, the suggest to input values via stdin certain
helps avoid issues with shell escaping.

       Geod may also be used  to  determine  intermediate  points
       along  either  a geodesic line between two points or along
       an arc of specified distance from a geographic point.   In
       both  cases  an  initial  point  must  be  specified  with
       +lat_1=lat and +lon_1=lon parameters and either a terminus
       point  +lat_2=lat and +lon_2=lon or a distance and azimuth
       from the initial point  with  +S=distance  and  +A=azimuth
       must be specified.
