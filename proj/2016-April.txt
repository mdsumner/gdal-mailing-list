Subject: [Proj] Introducing some intrusive (but API neutral) code changes in
	PROJ.4
Message-ID: <CAH0YoEMEydKrWFtAcQ5ys+hU3GZzUdTaNrAZsKA-qDFbEYUEwg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello proj users

I have recently submitted a pull request for PROJ.4, introducing some
rather intrusive code changes which will (hopefully) make a large part of
the PROJ.4 code easier to read, maintain, and contribute to.

Basically, the pull request will eliminate a large proportion of the
somewhat convoluted macros that currently enforces the implementation
policy for the projection code in PROJ.4. It should, however, not introduce
any changes API-wise, so most users of the library, and the proj, cs2cs,
and nad2nad programs should be unaffected.

If you suspect your use case may be affected anyway (or if you may be in a
position to offer helpful comments), please take a look at the pull request
over at https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/373

Sounds worthy to me. I just wish you had done it 10 years ago!

Subject: [Proj] Moving Math Constants to projects.h
Message-ID: <CAHLAsF2pJRzW4_S6TdBQOndBN++aL8j9g-=xef__CT5E7ghyOg@mail.gmail.com>

I've submitted a pull request to move math constants (most are some version
of PI) that have been used multiple places into projects.h.
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/372

Also, I've renamed a few of the less obvious constants names to more
obvious names.  I've added psuedocode for the constants (example FORTPI is
pi/4).  I've did some extra testing (beyond Travis-CI test) to make fairly
sure that any changes that I made did not alter the algorithms.  I would be
willing to add those test to proj.4.


Please let me know if there are any issues.


Thank you,

Looks like a sensible thing to do, and your pseudocode/mnemonics are quite
readable.

I think I have seen (and Google confirms) that TWO_OVER_PI is in common use
for the 2/pi thing you call TWO_D_PI, but I have no strong feelings for one
or the other
