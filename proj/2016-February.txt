Subject: [Proj] PROJ.4 4.9.2 and transformation of points outside datum
	shift grid
Message-ID: <56B04816.4070909@xs4all.nl>

[Resending without attachments to keep size below threshold]

Debian Bug #813066 [0] revealed a bug in the test handling of the
conversion between RD/NAP and ETRS89 when PROJ.4 4.9.2 is used.

Previous versions of PROJ.4 were unable to transform points outside the
available datum shift grid, as can be seen in the output of the test
script [1] in the file testrdtrans2008-4.9.1 [2].

With version 4.9.2 some points can now be calculated as seen in the
file testrdtrans2008-4.9.2 [3], but for tests 07 to 10 (whose points
"are outside the region where interpolation between either the NLGEO2004
geoid or the RD correction grid points is possible") in the direction
from RD/NAP to ETRS89 the results are entirely incorrect, whereas the
results for those same tests in opposite direction are mostly correct
except test 10 (edge_rd).

The documentation accompanying the rdtrans2008.gsb NTv2-grid and
naptrans2008.gtx VDatum-grid [4] mentions that the points for test 07 to
10 are outside the correction grid and that their "RD coordinates can be
computed, but the output should be handled with care".

With earlier versions there was no usable output, 4.9.2 reports
incorrect values (for some tests).

It looks like the fix for #292 [5][6] is the cause of this change. I'm
not sure whether this change is a bug or a feature.

In de debug logging for 4.9.2 we can see that for tests 07 to 10
pj_apply_vgridshift is no longer called, instead pj_apply_gridshift is
used. For tests 07 to 10 no z value is specified, so this looks like the
intended course of action to not apply the vertical grid shift.

On the other hand, the previous behaviour caused pj_apply_vgridshift to
log correctly that it failed to find a grid shift table for the location.

How should points outside datum shift grids be handled by PROJ.4?

The previous behaviour seems more correct, but with 4.9.2 some
transformations can be done that weren't before.

Hi Bas,

Reverting 
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/5d2af3a8 on top of current master 
didn't change the behaviour and still resulted in the vertical grid being 
(erroneously) applied as in official 4.9.2. The reason is that cs2cs.c always 
calls pj_transform() with a non-null z pointer (z=0 if not specified), so this 
changeset has no effect on that.

Investigating more, I found the following commit to be the cause :
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/338ea581
" apply patch from #271 to use GTX null value 88.88880f for vertical shifts" 
(message should read -88.88880f by the way to reflect the code)

Looking at the grid (downloaded from 
https://github.com/NaturalGIS/ntv2_transformations_grids_and_sample_data/blob/master/nl/naptrans2008.gtx 
), it appears it doesn't use the official null value -88.88880f  but various big 
negative values like -2147479936, -2147479808 and several others as well.

So I think we need probably a mix of both codes for wider compatibility. 
Something like :

/* nodata?  */
/* GTX official nodata value if  -88.88880f, but some grids also use other */
/* big values for nodata (e.g naptrans2008.gtx has nodata values like
/*  -2147479936), so test them too */
if( value > 1000 || value < -1000 || value == -88.88880f )

Checking >1000 or <-1000 is somewhat arbitrary, but I'm not aware of vgrids 
that have such big offsets (at least on Earth), so it is likely safe. The 
original ticket https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/271 doesn't report that 
they can cause problems in practice.

Howard ?

Is there a way to find out why these grids are doing their own thing for nodata?

I saw the patch in 271 and the link to the GTX doc and reasoned that the code didn't seem to be following the spec.  That's why I applied it.

I think we should implement it with support for both, as you've pushed.

I plan to work with you at the Paris Code Sprint [1] to push out a release of Proj 4.9.3. There are already ~15 issues closed [2] for that upcoming release. We can knock out a few more and make a release candidate by the end of that week.

I don't know, but Lennard Huisman <Lennard.Huisman at kadaster.nl> from
Kadaster has been very helpful on the Dutch list with all questions and
issues with the RD/NAP datum shift grids. He may be able to answer that
question.

Thanks for the pushing and merging the fix this quickly. I can confirm
that it fixes the issue for me.

(CC'ing proj mailing list)

That's interesting, as indeed, proj assumes that WGS84 == NAD83, if no extra parameters
are specified. Comparing the TOWGS84 values you suggest with the EPSG database,
I see you suggest using EPSG:6866 coordinate transformation "ITRF2000 to NAD83(CORS96)"
(actually the opposite transformation, NAD83(CORS96) to ITRF2000).

Wondering if it might be appropriate to change proj.4 defaults to the above ?

Although it is not clear to me which realization of WGS84 is supposed to be the one used
by proj.4 as its pivot when datum transformations are involved. I guess this must depends
on the semantics of the grid or towgs84 parameters used...

There's also the EPSG:6864 (ITRF96 to NAD83(CORS96)) values that could be used if we rely rather
on the original WGS84 realization : -0.9910, 1.9072,0.5129,0.02579,0.00965,0.01166,0


Using the HTDP grids ( https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/wiki/HTDPGrids ) might also be an option.


Indeed Daniel's suggestion seems to do the trick, or at least better match
other data from the site http://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/813fcefde1f64b209103107b26a8909f_0 
. I see it has also a geojson output :
http://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/813fcefde1f64b209103107b26a8909f_0.geojson

And the first feature returned is OBJECT_ID=4001 whose first vertex is :
-118.276946349107,33.7920287419671

If I do, 
ogr2ogr -f kml /vsistdout/ /vsizip/Building_Footprints.zip  -where "OBJECTID=4001" 

I get :
-118.276934177326,33.7920239166625

which is off by a bit more than 1 meter from the position of the geojson output.

But If I do :

ogr2ogr -f kml /vsistdout/ /vsizip/Building_Footprints.zip  -where "OBJECTID=4001" \
 -s_srs "+proj=lcc +lat_1=35.46666666666667 +lat_2=34.03333333333333 \
+lat_0=33.5 +lon_0=-118 +x_0=2000000.000101601 +y_0=500000.0001016002 \
+ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=-0.9956,1.9013,0.5215,0.025915,0.009426,0.011599,-0.00062 +units=us-ft +no_defs" \
-t_srs EPSG:4326

I get:

-118.276946349109,33.7920287419681

which is identical to the geojson output (difference is in the 10 micrometer precision range)

Hello,
I have implemented in my local fork of proj source code Modified Krovak 
projection. I have given krovak-m proj.4 code for this projection.

It can be used to fix missing EPSG codes 5221,5224,5225... in epsg 
transformation file.

If the proj community is interested or someone else is already working 
on it please let me know how can I correctly contribute to project.
