Subject: [Proj] Calculate map resolution / LCC
Message-ID: <CAOk+jYdJ70muTdJTRb-xbw=iEG6Tt_1BoEKC6CSAGf_2KpAHYA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have not been able to figure out how to calculate the map resolution of a
map in Lambert Conformant Conical (LCC). The maps are 1:500 000 and cover
about 7° longitude and 3-5° latitude.

Here's what I have:

- ellipsoid WGS84
- standard parallels 40/52N
- orthogonal meridian (roughly center of map, I use that as lon_0)
- k factor for a given latitude (roughly center of map, I use that as lat_0)
- a list of calibration points, basically the pixel coordinates of each 30'
intersection of latitude/longitude

The projection string I've come up with for one of the maps looks like this:

+proj=lcc +k_0=1.007 +lat_0=46 +lon_0=10.5 +lat_1=40 +lat_2=52 +x_0=0
+y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +units=m +no_defs

How would one go about determining the vertical and horizontal resolution?

What is the relationship between the pixel values and the map grid
(meters?).

Unfortunately I'm a rookie and just started trying to grasp the theory of
map projections. I use the GeographiLib by Charley Karney.

Thanks!

Regards,
Achim

Hello,

I'm working with different raster and vector data for all Argentina and I
can not find the official metric projection to represent the whole country
at once... The official projection according to the National Geography
Institute is Gauss-Kruger, but I think that is only useful for smaller
areas... Does anyone know what is normally used or have any suggestion on
what to use?

Thanks a lot in advance!

The international authority for all things geodetic/cartographic in Argentina is Mr. Rubén Rodríguez [rubenro at fibertel.com.ar].  If there is a national standard, Rubén knows it.

Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD49393E7F06@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello Achim.

I would calculate the resolution like this:

Take the two calibration points that are farthest away;
let's call them P and Q.

1) Compute the true distance in meters between them:

  a) Either take the long/lat coordinates for P and Q,
   and use for example http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/Geod

  b) Or else, take the projected coordinates (if you have them),
   and just use the theorem of Pythagoras to calculate the
   distance in meters. (This assumes that the local scale factor of the
   projection is near 1 in the area of interest, which it seems to be.)

2) Compute the image distance between P and Q, in pixels.
    Just use the theorem of Pythagoras on the pixel coordinates.

If the real-world distance between P and Q is s meters,
while the pixel distance is p pixels, then the image resolution
is
       s / p

meters per pixel.

Message-ID: <CA+L60sDtRmwvE5fRLimrTGgg1Oif9oH7Gi8+kX=1LZZVNhWa5w@mail.gmail.com>

I've got a case where I would like to identify the domain of a projection
programmatically. Take the geos projection for example:


$> invproj +proj=geos +h=35785831 +units=m
5.3e6 0
68d48'11.267"E    0dN

5.4e6 0
74d56'57.772"E    0dN

5.5e6 0
*    *


$> invproj +proj=geos +h=50000000 +units=m
5.5e6 0
69d42'46.646"E    0dN

5.6e6
74d40'19.703"E    0dN

5.7e6
*    *


Are the mathematical limits of Proj4 projections generally available (the C
interface is fine), or is using a numerical method the only way to
calculate the domain?


Notes:
 * There are some domains/bounds available on spatialreference.org (e.g.,
http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/4277/) but they are not exhaustive,
are transformed to WGS84 and have presumably been calculated manually.
 * I've had a quick look at PJ_geos to see if this particular example has a
simple solution (and indeed grepped for "limits", "bounds", and "range" in
the whole proj.4 source) without much luck.
 * I've already got a programmatic solution to this, I'm really looking to
find out if there is a more elegant mathematical answer to my problem.

Many thanks in advance,

Phil

others here will have better insights than me, but I'd consider
that many of the mathematical functions involved are continuous,
and without limit. Others will of course blow up once you get too
far away/past 90 deg lat. But just because others don't
immediately blow up, doesn't mean they are still useful far away.
The best you could I would think would be to define some
arbitrary limit of distortion and then solve for the boundary
value that gives you that, or decide on some arbitrary distance
cut off from a regional named CRS.

As different people in different fields of study will have
different requirements for maximum allowable distortion, setting
a fixed geographical limit on it will always be a compromise.


aka, how long is a piece of string?

Subject: [Proj] Lambert projection with one or two standard parallels and
	proj4
Message-ID: <CAMQ1PJhs+YY_Nu0zefqY9G49Tun6N2Ru0_R-=C4WS=cEeYg5qw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I'm sure there is a gap in my understanding, but I haven't been able to
identify where it is, nor how to fill it. My issue is this:

I'm transforming lon lat coordinates into a lambert conformal conic
projection.

The lambert projection uses a single standard parallel 46.244 and the
central meridian is 17.0. And it's on a sphere, but that's not particularly
relevant here. I am using packages that use the proj4 library.

I test the transformation using linux tool cs2cs as follows:

echo "15.220483 48.437298" | cs2cs +proj=lonlat +to +proj=lcc
+lat_1=46.244 +lat_0=46.244 +lon_0=17. +a=6367470 +b=6367470 +ellps=sphere
+datum=WGS84

-131346.80 245318.16

I also understand that the one-standard parallel form is the same as the
two-standard parallel form if the two standard parallels are the same. It
is more convenient for me to give all parallels in my scripts - let proj do
the work. So I also test with:

echo "15.220483 48.437298" | cs2cs +proj=lonlat +to +proj=lcc +lat_1=46.244
+lat_2=46.244 +lat_0=46.244 +lon_0=17. +a=6367470 +b=6367470 +ellps=sphere
+datum=WGS84

-131290.66 245281.34

yet I get different results. Any ideas as to why?

And at very least, what am I doing wrong and which approach should I use?

Kind regards,
Linton Corbet

The default values of lat_1 and lat_2 are 33 and 45, so in your first
example you had +lat_1=46.244 +lat_2=45 which is not what you intended.
The second example does what you wanted.

Message-ID: <51790AAB.7070809@gmx.eu>

A few additional remarks:

- add +no_defs to your first example in order to avoid unwanted default 
values

- about this part: +a=6367470 +b=6367470 +ellps=sphere +datum=WGS84

+datum=WGS84 is a shorthand for: +ellps=WGS84 +towgs84=0,0,0. You 
already have +ellps=sphere. Your reference surface cannot be a shpere 
and the WGS84 ellipsoid at the same time. As you already have +a=6367470 
and +b=6367470, you should drop both +ellps=sphere and +datum=WGS84

- in case of doubts, use cs2cs -v for more info about which parameters 
are actually takes, and which are ignored
