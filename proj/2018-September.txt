After creating a GTX table for OSGM15, the height calculations look
correct. Thanks for help Alain and Even!

Is it possible to contribute these GTX files, so they are included into
future proj4 releases?
Should I make a PR to this repo: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid ?

The tables are here for now:
https://github.com/elmirjagudin/gri2gtx

I see this text in the 'TRANSFORMATIONS AND OSGM15 - user guide' document,
which is included in the same archive as grid tables data files:

"All three transformation models are licensed to users pursuant to the
terms of the Open Source Initiative BSD
Licence (see http://opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php)."

(Page 4, "Use of the transformation models" section)

Looks like the model is under BSD-2-Clause license, right?
Is that an acceptable license for proj-datumgrid package?

Yes, the BSD 2-clause license is compatible with the proj-datumgrid package.

I will prepare a release candidate of said package on Monday, so if you want these grids included in the next version please open a pull request within the next couple of days.

Great!

Here is the PR:
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/pull/24

Let me know if I should add the tables differently, I'll adjust the PR.

Also, it's not a huge deal for me if the PR does not make it into the
upcoming release. I just want to have it included into
the official repo at some point, so that all the tables are collected at
the same place.

Regards,
Elmir

Subject: [Proj] using Equal Earth in R
Message-ID: <CACZW+=HbHkgbU3NWQWct==g0iYRt=O8Rjw=Wbao1YmTWrNMHrg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I am hoping to use the Equal Earth projection in some visualizations
produced in R, but I can't seem to get the projection to load in R. I saw
that it is listed as available from proj4 here:
https://proj4.org/operations/projections/eqearth.html.

For instance, in the simple instance below I get the following error:

install.packages('proj4')
install.packages('ggalt')
library(proj4)
library(ggalt)
xy <- data.frame("long" = quakes$long, "lat" = quakes$lat)
s <- project(xy, "+proj=eqearth")
Error in project(xy, "+proj=eqearth") : unknown projection id

Are there other packages required to use this projection? Or is this an
error on my part, or a bug? I do practically zero geographic visualization,
just need this for a figure and thought it would be cool to use the new
Equal Earth projection.

thanks!
Sam

Samuel,

I can only speak to the PROJ part of your question, anything concerning R you are likely to get better answers in a different forum.

The Equal Earth projection is available in PROJ 5.2 which will be released within the next week or so. So unless you want to faff about with compiling you own version and linking it to R I am afraid what you want is not possible. Yet anyway. I assume it will take some time before the R guys and whatever package management you are using adopt the new PROJ version.

/Kristian

Hi Proj community,

 I'm the author of a NTV2 grid to convert Belgian Datum 72 to ETRS89.
 This grid increases the accuracy of the convertion between Belgian Lambert 72 (EPSG 31370) and Belgian Lambert 2008 (EPSG 3812).
 It has been validated by Service Public de Wallonie (SPW) and Institut gÃ©ographique National (IGN) as you can see on http://www.ngi.be/FR/FR2-1-7.shtm

 My request is, can you include a link in https://proj4.org/resource_files.html for Belgium with somethings like that
Belgium NTv2.0
      Belgium Datum 72 to ETRS89
      Source : Nicolas SIMON, with a link to http://www.ngi.be/FR/FR2-1-7.shtm
      Format : NTv2

      License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0

I'll be glad if the grid can be included in the proj-datumgrid/europe/ package

I am open to any form of communication to make this information known.
Let me know.

Thank you

Best regards
Nicolas SIMON

I don't see any problems in including these on both the website and the European datumgrid package.
The simplest way to make this happen is to submit pull requests to the PROJ and proj-datumgrid
repositories on GitHub.

noted on cygwin that the shared library name is going backward

5.1.0 is cygproj-13.dll
5.2.0RC1 is cygproj-12.dll


There is a wrong progression from
libproj_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined -version-info 14:0:1
to
libproj_la_LDFLAGS = -no-undefined -version-info 14:0:2


The LibTool version number is usually given in the form 
current:revision:age. This means that:

- If interfaces have been changed or added, but binary compatibility has 
been preserved, change to current+1:0:age+1
- If binary compatibility has been broken, e.g. due to removed or 
changed interfaces, change to current+1:0:0
- If the interface is the same as the previous version, change to 
current:revision+1:age


So assuming that compatibility is not broken
it should be or 15:0:2 or 14:1:1
as both will give cygproj-13.dll

Thanks Marco,

This was also discovered by Sebastian who quickly submitted a fix: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1114

Sebastian also submitted a few other fixes. If no other problems are found I will issue RC2 Wednesday evening (European time).

Subject: [Proj] PROJ 5.2.0RC2 + promotion to final release
Message-ID: <DA59580F-A878-41BA-A848-5B1378FB2713@sdfe.dk>

All,

A few minor problems was found in the first first release candidate of PROJ 5.2.0.
These has been corrected and RC2 is now available for download here:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0RC2.tar.gz (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0RC2.tar.gz.m5d)

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0RC2.zip (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0RC2.zip.m5d)

Since the corrections are minor I donât expect more candidates for this release and would like to use this
announcement to also call a vote for promotion to final release of PROJ 5.2.0RC2. Additionally, I call a
Vote for promotion of proj-datumgrid-1.8RC1, proj-datumgrid-europe-1.1RC1 and
proj-datumgrid-north-america-1.1RC1 to final release.

Iâll start with my +1âs for the promotion to final release of all four packages.

/Kristian

Subject: [Proj] Canada NTv2.0 grid shift files
Message-ID: <3327F243-D9DA-4D0B-AC36-170274E971A9@archeotec.ca>

Hi,

According to your web site (see below) Canadaâs NTv2.0 grid shift files are considered non-free Grids.  I have recently been in contact with NRCAN regarding this fact and they have confirm that the license of the file is now considered Open under Canadaâs Open Data license.  

https://open.canada.ca/en/open-government-licence-canada

We are now â... free to Copy, modify, publish, translate, adapt, distribute or otherwise use the Information in any medium, mode or format for any lawful purpose.â

I am there proposing that Canadaâs outdated NTv1.0 file should be removed from the proj packages and be replaced by the NTv2.0 grids.  I can provide the new license, the contacts at NRCAN, if needed, and the latest NTv2.0 file in order to facilitate the proposed changes.

If you are responsible for this part of the project or if there is a more formal way of asking this change, please contact me directly.

Thanks,
Nicolas Cadieux

Btw, the link below for the file no longer works. I will provide a new link if needed during a transition period.


https://proj4.org/resource_files.html
âNon-Free Grids

Not all grid shift files have licensing that allows them to be freely distributed, but can be obtained by users through free and legal methods.

Canada NTv2.0

Although NTv1 grid shifts are provided freely with PROJ, the higher-quality NTv2.0 file needs to be downloaded from Natural Resources Canada. More info: http://www.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/tools-outils/ntv2_e.php.â

Subject: [Proj] cct DMS input
Message-ID: <5da3468a-8f1a-5318-ae91-caa34764f493@teec.de>



hi all,

  how can I use DMS input format with the pipelinng scheme of PROJ?

For example here only the last input line gives the correct answer.
DMS input is apparently not honoured, but only decimal degree
input recognised. Am I missing an option to allow for DMS input?

>cat input.txt

Gerald,

No - currently cct does not process DMS. But in a recent discussion over at
the PROJ Github site, Kristian Evers proposed this workaround:

(quote)

Until cct can parse DMS coordinates you can use cs2cs as a pre-filter to
cct:

echo 6d55\'57\"S 37d23\'30\"E | cs2cs -f %.8f +proj=latlong | cct -c 2,1
-t0 -z1000 +proj=molodensky +ellps=clrk80 +da=-112.145 +df=-0.54750714e-4
+dx=-175 +dy=-23 +dz=-303
 37.3924628036   -6.9346316313      991.7547        0.000

(unquote)

Obviously cct *should* support DMS, but the traditional way, using " and '
does not play very well with quoted strings, so personally I tend to prefer
Charles Karney's DDD:MM:SS.sss notation, used in GeographicLib. Essentially
supporting both should not be a huge task, and a pull request would be very
welcome

Message-ID: <32CF209F-58C4-4E41-B311-5FE6947E5568@sdfe.dk>

On behalf of the PROJ development team I am happy to announce
the release of PROJ 5.2.0. This release includes both bug fixes and
new features (see https://proj4.org/news.html#proj-5-2-0 for details).

The source distribution of the new version can be downloaded here:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0.tar.gz (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0.tar.gz.md5)
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0.zip (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-5.2.0.zip.md5)

    NOTE that this will be the last version of PROJ that publicly
    exposes the projects.h header. This will also be the last version
    including the NMAKE build system for Windows. Please adjust
    your software and workflows accordingly in preparation for the
    next version scheduled for release early next year.


As well as a new version of PROJ we are also releasing new
versions of the datumgrid packages. These are

proj-datumgrid-1.8 (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.8.zip)
proj-datumgrid-europe-1.1 (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-europe-1.1.zip)
proj-datumgrid-north-america-1.1 (http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-north-america-1.1.zip)

Yea, it's been licensed like that for a while now I thought and they are at
http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/b3534942-31ea-59cf-bcc3-f8dc4875081a
without having to create and register an account at NRCAN to get them,
unless they're different and I missed something. i put in the original
request to make them open =)

Not sure why they got placed under non-free. Maybe it's the liability
clause that makes them non-free or not 'true' open data.

I probably added this information to the non-free section a decade
ago, back when it was on a Trac wiki. As the instructions note, at the
time you had to get a special log in to get the files. But now that it
has a more appealing license and no registration, it seems that these
files can be included for general distribution.

I've started a ticket here: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj-datumgrid/issues/26

Cheers,
Mike

Thanks,

I will look at the ticket and will be happy to help.  I just was not sure were to start to get this added in the Project.

Hi,
The old license was more restrictive so I guess that was the reason. I see a ticket has been made to include them in the future.
Thanks for responding.

Roger,

Probably, yes. Could you share some details on how you got there? Did you use make or CMake?

My mistake. I see that 5.2.0 now requires g++. I did not add that to
my spec file. I thought it was a default thing in the build
environment. Seems not.

If you are curious, I try to maintain builds here:

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:rogeroberholtzer/proj

These are the platforms I test for. There are others that are also supported.

Yeah, we recently introduced the googletest suite which is C++ based. Hence the new requirement. That should probably have been specified in the release notes now that I think of it...

Are you all set now that you've updated your spec file or do we need to make some changes that will ease things for you and others with later releases?

Hi,

I see this will be added to the North-American package file.  Do you if these files are normally part of the QGIS distribution?  Wrong place to ask? I am just not sure how various software Libraries interact with each other.  If they are not usually added, I will write a ticket on the QGIS side to have the NTv2.0 file included.

Will it be possible to modify the info on the web site?  I see a previous answer by Don that has the correct web link.  Do you have a ticket system for the web site or are you still able to modify the site?

Cheers!

Nicolas

As far as I am aware it is not. It is my hope that they will eventually make it so that users who need these packages can install them, i.e. as optional packages in OSGeo4W but so far that idea hasnât really gained traction. Perhaps if enough users request it?

Yes. Feel free to submit a pull request with your changes. I believe this is the relevant file to edit: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/docs/source/resource_files.rst <https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/docs/source/resource_files.rst>

It's very surprising that a library that has required only c99 for many
years suddenly requires not just c++ but c++11.   That's not a problem
in many places, but I suspect is an issue for some enviroments.   So if
it's possible to avoid this (different test library?), that would be
nice.

Next major version will require C++11 for new functional code

Thanks - that's IMHO unfortunate, but it makes the current discussion
moot.

Greg,

It's time to move forward. New fangled C++11 is already 7+ years old :)

There have been some very vocal mailing list members who have complained vociferously about the people doing the development of PROJ not doing the things that they want. C99 compatibility in perpetuity has an opportunity cost. Those who wish to preserve C99 compatibility for PROJ for all of Even's WKT efforts did not step forward to take the work on. Those who can only use C99 can continue to use the older versions of the software. If we need to open some maintenance branches to preserve their continued patches and improvements of those branches, they can start making pull requests against the relevant release tags.

WKT going into PROJ (and its C++11 requirement) is a recognition of PROJ's role in a constellation of software. The inability to speak definitions of coordinate systems in the language that the rest of the industry can consume hurts interoperability of PROJ and all of the software pieces that depend upon it. Through the gdalbarn.com <http://gdalbarn.com/> effort, Even is leading a significant reinvestment in the infrastructure of these software tools and their relationships to each other. This effort has a incremental roadmap that isn't too disruptive to PROJ.

The different test library makes it more efficient to write tests more easily. A refactor of all of the tests to a different framework is a big lift for little gain. Again, someone must step forward to take on the development of these nice-to-haves.

Just to be sure:

Do you mean that there will not be a C interface to the new PROJ? Or
you are meaning that PROJ itself will be c++11, but with a C API for
client programs to use. I am guessing/hoping the later.

Point 3:

- Part of that C++ externally accessible API *might* also be exposed
through new
C API

So I am guegsing that whatever can currently be done in the C API will
continue. New things available via the c++ interface are undecided.

Yes, that was point 4: "existing proj C API still available through the plans 
exposed in the past."
And the deprecation plans for the previous generations of C API are exposed 
in:

While digging around this file, it turns out this file wasn't cheap in 2001:
https://web.archive.org/web/20010227084518/http://cgis.geod.nrcan.gc.ca/products/html-public/GSDapps/English/NTv2_Fact_Sheet.html

CD ROM: $195.00
Developer's License (includes CD-ROM): $995.00
CD-ROM wholesale for re-distribution (minimum 20 units): $50.00
(!)

Nevertheless, anyone can now freely download and use this file. Ensure
this file is file is named lowercase, and put in PROJ_LIB. It should
work with most versions of PROJ (back to version 4.4.7). When
released, ntv2_0.gsb should be part of version 1.2 of the
proj-datumgrid-north-america region-specific package.

Message-ID: <882B9850-BCE1-4A43-B94D-EAA19A1A5146@contoso.com>

In effect, this is a question about whether or how well I understand the new pipeline approach.

Here's an example transformation I have been using at my site, using cs2cs. It is considered to be correct.

echo 1501839.77549     456388.976491 | \
    cs2cs \
	+from \
	  +init=epsg:26743 \
	  +nadgrids=@conus, at alaska, at ntv2_0.gsb, at ntv1_can.dat \
	  +to \
	  +init=epsg:2227 \
	  +nadgrids=nullï»¿

The online Version 4 to Version 5 API migration guide
  ( https://kbevers.github.io/development/migration.html )
describes that cs2cs does a transformation like this one by passing "through the ill-defined WGS84 reference frame, using it as a hub" and points out shortcomings of that approach. 
Various descriptions I've seen of the new pipeline approach have seemed to imply that it's better at least in part because it doesn't use WGS84 as a "hub".

Following the example in the migration guide, here's what I've found for performing the same using cct:

echo 1501839.77549     456388.976491 | \
cct -z 0 -t 0\
+proj=pipeline \
      +step \
      +inv \
      +init=epsg:26743 \
      +nadgrids=@conus, at alaska, at ntv2_0.gsb, at ntv1_can.dat \
      +step \
      +init=epsg:2227 \
      +nadgrids=null

The respective outputs match  -- great!

But it also eems to me that by specifying +inv, it is still passing through WGS84. It's now explicit, which is good, but is it really fundamentally different? Is there some other way to get from one projected system to another?

Or am I just completely confused?

Thanks
-Don

Don,

I see that you are looking at an outdated development version of the docs. I should have removed that a long time ago. Please go to https://proj4.org instead. The migration guide is the same but the rest of the docs are significantly improved.

Regarding the pipeline youâve described below, yes it is exactly same as what cs2cs is doing. While stepping through WGS84 as a hub is generally a bad idea, quite often it is the only practical choice. Either because you havenât got access to a better way to do the transformation or because that is simply how they are defined. Often times there will be a better way to do the transformation but we still havenât got a mechanism for helping you set that up. We are working on that though (or Even is, I should say).

So in summary, youâve got it all right. I acknowledge that we havenât made it particularly easy to do transformations as simple as they are done with pj_transform(). The function proj_create_crs_to_crs() is meant to replace it but so far it has been restricted to +init setups which unfortunately has led to most people doing similar pipelines as  below invoked with proj_create(). I intend to make this easier in PROJ 6.0.0.

For examples of how the pipeline framework can be used to do transformations without stepping through WGS84 have a look at https://github.com/NordicGeodesy/NordicTransformations. These are a collection of transformations used in the Nordic countries and none of them use WGS84 a hub. Some are quite complicated (have a look at the resources/NKG file) and some are rather similar to what you are used to from cs2cs.

/Kristian

Thanks, Kristian, for the thoughtful and extensive response,

And the more I think about it, the more it makes sense what you say, that stepping through WGS84 as a hub is often the only practical choice.

It is also helpful to receive the affirmation that I've got it right.

https://erouault.blogspot.com/
An important milestone has been reached now with the SQLite-based CRS and 
coordinate operation database being in place and usable.

Altough not finished yet, I think that it could be interesting for this work 
[1] to be merged into master for broader testing. I'll prepare soon a RFC for 
that purpose.

Thanks, Even. It is nice to see your work coming a long nicely!

I agree that it would be good to merge your code soon. As you mention, it is already a huge amount of code compared to the existing code base. It is an intimidating task to get an overview of it all. Can you include some notes for reviewers in the RFC on where to start? I am sure some parts are more important than others from an architectural perspective at least.
