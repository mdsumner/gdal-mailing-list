Subject: [Proj] Update to EPSG database v8.8
Message-ID: <201601131158.38297.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

Just to inform you I've just completed the update to EPSG v8.8 (previous one 
was v8.5) in GDAL trunk ( ​https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/32964 ), 
libgeotiff trunk ( ​https://trac.osgeo.org/geotiff/changeset/2714 ) and proj.4 
master ( ​
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/commit/832329a9aadbfcb7f46919c903f7672e719d2a82 
). (and proposed PostGIS spatial_ref_sys.sql : 
https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/3427 )

As you can see (proj.4 nad/epsg file is probably the most readable to see the 
diffs), It brings a bunch of new SRS, updated TOWGS84 shifts, etc...

Please report if you notice any issue.

Best regards,

Even

This paper

   M. F. Buchroithner and R. Pfahlbusch,
   "Geodetic grids in authoritative maps -- new
   findings about the origin of the UTM grid" (2016)
   http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15230406.2015.1128851

has some interesting background on the origins of UTM and MGRS.

In particular, the division of non-polar regions into 60 zones, the
numbering of the zones, and the specific conventions adopted for MGRS
all seem to have been borrowed by the US Army Map Service from the
German military work in 1943-1944.

Figures 3 and 8 show 2 wartime orthophotos of 1km squares in Estonia and
Lithuania with designations (UTMREF), 35VLF6992 and 34UEG0578, which
coincide with the present-day MGRS designations for these areas
(respectively 59.451N 24.698E and 55.752N 21.088E).

(The correspondence isn't exact because of differences in the datum and
in the choice of the scale on the central meridian.)

Other differences include Zone numbering increasing East - starting at the 180° meridian; zero mention of ANY datums - just the five basic “spheroids:” Clarke 1866, Clarke 1880, Everest 1830, Bessel 1841, & International 1909 - AND the fact that UTM and UPS Grids replaced the United States Domestic and World Polyconic Grids.  There were some mighty similar conventions between the WPG and the later-developed MGRS. I agree that the UTM has many similarities to the DHG and the Russia Belts; however I’m not convinced that the the DHG is the sole originator of the UTM.  The British Grids, albeit different, might be the grand daddy of ‘em all.  The Loxodrome Grid boundaries, of course were exceptions.

To compute the European Datum 1950, the Grid projection tables first had to be computed for the International 1909 ellipsoid.  AMS did that with the 1/2500 scale factor reduction (0.9996) first - before the German computing staff did the work under the supervision of U.S. Army Map Service geodesists.  I think Professor Gigas was the German site representative for that operation supervised by the Americans: Col. Hough C.E., Andrew Glusic, and Jacob A. Wolkeau.

I agree a lot of what went into UTM/UPS as "in the air" before the
second world war

  * Grid notations with letter designations for a 100km square and
    numerals within the square (a British invention?).
  * Transverse Mercator with a sucession of central meridians, equally
    spaced at 3 degree or 6 degree intervals (Germany, Russia?).

and I recognize that the AMS did sterling work in the 50s defining a
worldwide ellipsoid and datum.

The evidence from the paper is that the German military had adopted by
1943-1944

  * a world-wide system of 60 6-degree zones numbered starting at 180W;
  * 500km false easting, 0km false northing for N hemisphere;
  * 8 degree latitude bands lettered C thru X (skipping I+O);
  * letters A+B used for the S pole, Y+Z used for the N pole (no
    indication of the projection);
  * A thru Z used for column labeling of 100km square repeating every 3
    zones;
  * A thru V used for row labeling repeating every 20 squares;
  * a five letter offset on the row labels for even numbered zones.

All of these are elements of UTM and MGRS.  It's possible that the first
two of these might have been arrived independently.  However it's
difficult to make that argument with the lettering conventions.

That looks like a very interesting article. Thank you for posting about it. 
I've put in a request for our library to get a copy. Do they explain why "UTMREF" 
was used? I would have expected UGKREF instead.

The paper says

   This grid reference system was, in an abbreviated way, then called
   "UTM-REF" (Universales Transversales Mercator-Referenzsystem), its
   name being derived from the internationally common term "Transversale
   Mercator-Abbildung" ("Transverse Mercator Projection") for the
   Gauss-Krueger "Abbildung".

Subject: [Proj] Some details on German Army Grid (Re: MGRS invented by
	Germany?)
Message-ID: <56A3CA71.4080103@ludens.elte.hu>

Dear Colleagues,

the cited German paper was interesting indeed, thanks to Charles for the 
reference. I requested the full text from the author via the 
ResearchGate (first author is registered there). Perhaps I'm allowed to 
share some details of the DHG system (and sorry, nothing about the 
similarities to MGRS here):

According to my best knowledge, the German DHG and the Russian 
Gauss-Krueger belts (the latter one MIGHT be a result of the pre-war 
cooperation between these empires) were the first transverse Mercator 
zone systems with 6 degrees zones. In the Russian system (used later 
also by the Warsaw Pact military), the zones were indicated by a 
'leading digit' in the Easting coords (e.g. in the zone '34', between 
18-24d longitude, the False Easting number was 4,500,000 instead of the 
standard 500,000 of the modern UTM - this digit '4' indicated the second 
digit of the zone number. And yes, the Russian maps of the Himalayas has 
False Easting of 14,500,000 ) In some German war maps, this leading 
digit was not used, while in the restored Hungarian war basepoint list, 
it was used. The earlier introduced German civilian grid used the 
3-degree wide zones, the same system that is used nowadays in Germany.

During the WWII, the Germans made a tremendous work, integrating many 
European networks and maps to their DHG system. A key person behind this 
operation was an Austrian expert, dr. Karl Ledersteger (Austria was 
annexed by Germany in 1938), and after the war, he published some 
interesting details about this in Vienna. If someone is interested 
(Cliff maybe?), I can send one in PDF, of course it is in German language.

The hardest part of this integration was to make a more or less unified 
geodetic network, in modern terms, a horizontal datum for the DHG. Many 
national basepoint systems were transformed, in the somewhat cooperating 
countries, like Bohemia (albeit they were occupied in 1939), Hungary, 
Latvia, it was carried out by local experts, while in Poland and Russia 
(where also Bessel-ellipsoid based datums were used prior to the WWII), 
they were more or less accepted with the same coordinates. The starting 
geodetic basis was the German (in fact, the old Prussian) Rauenberg 
datum, which was called after the unification RDN (ReichsDreiecksNetz) 
1940. According to my 2004 paper (sorry, it is in Hungarian, with a 
small English summary at the end), it is practically identical to the 
present-day German DHDN77 system within an error margin of a few meters. 
However, these errors must be higher in Poland and Russia, where the 
Borowa Góra 1925 and Pulkovo 1932 Bessel datums were used, respectively. 
It was even extended to Switzerland, which was extensively photographed 
by the German planes flying to and from Italy during the war.

The RDN1940 was the very first European continental geodetic datum, and 
the second worldwide, after the American NAD1927. I also made an 
accuracy check: the unified datums transformation parameters between the 
RDN1940 and the WGS84 provided a transformation accuracy along the 
vector from Budapest to Berlin in the same range (better than 5 meters) 
than inside Germany and inside Hungary, so the consistency of the datum 
was quite good. According to other works of dr. Ledersteger (who was, 
obviously, a key person in this computation, too ), these data were used 
as input of the ED50 works. Albeit Europe was cut into two by the iron 
curtain in these years, a Hungarian paper from 1953 reported about the 
(theoretical) extension of the ED50 to Hungary, based similarly on DHG 
(by Lajos Homoródi, professor of the technical university of Budapest).

My paper is available at:
http://www.fomi.hu/honlap/magyar/szaklap/2004/06/6.pdf
and since its host institute might be a subject of re-structuring, this 
permalink is in danger, I uploaded it to ResearchGate, too.
