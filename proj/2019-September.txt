This is of course 6.2.0 and NOT 6.2.2.

Subject: [PROJ] WGS84 Misaligned Maps Paper - Draft being created for OGC
 Technical Committee meeting
Message-ID: <CABqeU+i2W=mSwtHw3vTLSepgkWg9eKwsWc7SW4+7QS+o=d1aZA@mail.gmail.com>

Proj folks, we've been drafting a paper which Joel Haasdyk from Australia
will be presenting at the OGC Technical Committee meeting next week.
It summarises the challenges faced by high-accuracy mapping and time
dependence, as is currently being exposed in web-mapping. Much of this is
rooted in discussions about projections.
If any of you have the opportunity to review within the day couple of days,
it would be much appreciated.

The concise and reasonable polished summary to be presented to the OGC is
at:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/16smvZfM2uX35Od6rDHs3hO4gyx_p4FK7r14z4bbQ6XM/edit#


-------------------------

If you are super interested, and have a significant amount of spare time,
you are welcome to trawl through my verbose working notes, (which covers
more detail about problems and potential solutions, but which is also much
less polished and has errors):
Verbose working version:

Hello, 

in the name of simplicity I would suggest storing and referencing data
to "what the most simple GPS (GNSS) receiver gives" if possible ... and
without any additional datum or ellipsoid or time (outside GMT(UTC) or
geoid transformations. Since GPS receivers usually give accurate time
and (temporary) coordinate information BUT often cannot even calculate
the geoid correctly (so better to use the reference ellipsoid instead).
So anything too complicated from the GPS receiver is out of the question
... and would also slow down the process needlessly when recording lot
of points. 

And since that would be the preferred way to store data ... and what
also could stay reasonably accurate at least year or two everywhere on
the planet (forgetting the time) which usually suits most needs. And
then the rest of the complexity built on that and starting from there. 

If one needs to know wehere the point really was since it is now maybe
50 years since it was measured he would then do some more (but minimal)
complicated calculations. 

A good real life example of that would be: 

- the beginning of some Australian runway was recorded "here"
(coordinates and time using some simple GPS receiver) 50 years ago
[additionally maybe its length, direction and slope] 

- where it is now (coordinates directly usable with some simple GPS
receiver .. so to be able to ask "where should I go now to find the same
spot") 

- most simple and fastest calculation possible 

Janne.

Hi Janne,

Thanks for your suggestions. As I understand it, you are suggesting take 
the simple approach, which is "near enough" and don't worry about 
accounting for tectonic plate movement. This is the approach that has 
been used in web-mapping to date. In Australia, we are discovering that 
that this approach is not "good enough" anymore. Australia is on the 
fastest moving tectonic plate, moving at 7cm per year, a point on our 
national static datum (from 1994) is ~ 1.8 out from to where a GPS 
receiver says it should be. This inaccuracy is not good enough for many 
of modern mapping's emerging use cases. Hence this week's conversations 
at the OGC technical committee meeting will be around options for 
improving accuracy.

Thanks again, Cameron

Message-ID: <alpine.LFD.2.21.1909071504380.32577@reclus.nhh.no>

Hi,

I've looked but cannot find the "get" side of 
proj_context_set_search_paths(). Does one exist, or is there an 
alternative way of getting the current active search path?

Reason for question: to be able to add a local directory, for example 
holding grid files downloaded on the fly or caches from previous sessions, 
and where the default data/ directory is not user-writable, I think I need 
to build the ":" or ";" separated list to update the search path. To avoid 
overwriting it, I need to prepend the active search path to the local 
user-writable directory.

Hope this is just something I've missed, a function returning a string, or 
equivalent mechanism.

Roger

Good move, I think all proj based end-user applications should also
implement this logic.

Here's how we do it in QGIS. Excuse the mix of pure c++/proj/qt api (a
necessary by-product of working in QGIS code):

on startup:

// append local user-writable folder as a proj search path
QStringList currentProjSearchPaths = QgsProjUtils::searchPaths();
currentProjSearchPaths.append( qgisSettingsDirPath() + "proj" );
char **newPaths = new char *[currentProjSearchPaths.length()];
for ( int i = 0; i < currentProjSearchPaths.count(); ++i )
{
  newPaths[i] = CPLStrdup( currentProjSearchPaths.at( i
).toUtf8().constData() );
}
proj_context_set_search_paths( nullptr,
currentProjSearchPaths.count(), newPaths );
for ( int i = 0; i < currentProjSearchPaths.count(); ++i )
{
  CPLFree( newPaths[i] );
}
delete [] newPaths;

where QgsProjUtils::searchPaths() is:

QStringList QgsProjUtils::searchPaths()
{
   const QString path( proj_info().searchpath );
  QStringList paths;
  #if PROJ_VERSION_MINOR==1 && PROJ_VERSION_PATCH==0
  // -- see https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1497
  paths = path.split( ';' );
  #else
  #ifdef Q_OS_WIN
  paths = path.split( ';' );
  #else
  paths = path.split( ':' );
  #endif
  #endif
  QSet<QString> existing;
  // thin out duplicates from paths -- see
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/1498
  QStringList res;
  res.reserve( paths.count() );
  for ( const QString &p : qgis::as_const( paths ) )
  {
    if ( existing.contains( p ) )
      continue;
    existing.insert( p );
    res << p;
  }
  return res;
}

There's quite a bit of logic here which is in place to work around
earlier PROJ 6 release behavior, see the links commented in the code
above.

It does seem justified, doesn't it? It might be even more sensible if (at 
some time in the future) the user-writable cache directory was shared 
between applications, so that different R or Python packages or QGIS etc. 
didn't each have to have separate dumps of the same grid files ... just 
speculating.

This:                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

was what I needed for a first prototype, thanks very much! I'd missed this 
because I didn't read the PROJ_INFO struct definition in proj.h (starting 
line 273 in the 6.2.0 source).

$XDG_DATA_HOME/proj is appropriate for the user-writable cache.

Subject: [PROJ] OSGeo incubation status
Message-ID: <AA1B1545-6662-4F5B-9861-2A8707F290F4@sdfe.dk>

All,

At the code sprint held in conjunction with the FOSS4G conference I put some more
work into the PROJ OSGeo Incubation checklist [0]. Since PROJ is already a well-
established project most of the details has been easy to fill out. The only two
things left need to left before the checklist is finished are

1. Provenance review and other copyright/license related things
2. A logo for the project

The provenance review is by far the most daunting task in the incubation process.
I have started the work already. The progress can be seen on [1]. Still missing
are the sections on the license status of the individual source files and the
section on copyright holders. The latter is easy to compile once the first is finished.

For the review of the license status of the individual files I have created a Google
spreadsheet to keep track of the information. It is linked in the Provence Review
Wiki-page. Everyone is able to suggest changes. I would like to encourage you all
to do so - it is a big list to go through by myself. Guidelines for how to fill out the list
can be found in the OSGeo Incubation Provenance Review wiki-page [2], but mostly
it is self-explanatory.

As part of the provenance review it is also asked if committers has signed a
“Contribution Agreement”. Currently we don’t have one. I am not sure if we need it,
but if so, can anyone link me to an existing one that can be used as a template for
PROJ?


As for the project logo, does anyone subscribing to this list have artistic skills? If so,
suggestions for a new logo would be appreciated :-)


I would also appreciate if someone familiar with the OSGeo Incubation process
would be willing to go through checklist in it’s current state and provide feedback.
There is almost certainly going to be mistakes in the material I have filled in so far.

I'm quite sure no one has signed one, and I do not see any reason for contributors to PROJ to sign one going forward.

I've just asked write permission to update a few things.
I believe that most of the code under src/projections originates from Gerald 
Evenden's initial work, so basically any file originally coming from
https://download.osgeo.org/proj/from_kai/PROJ.4.3.3.tar.gz is Public Domain, 
later relicensed to X/MIT by Frank Warmerdam.
For other files, "git log" on them and finding the original committer should 
be good enough.

Agreed. Given the super permissive license of MIT, there would be hardly no 
reason to relicense the code to something else. A CLA might bring other 
advantages (like having "legal certainty" that a contribution was really 
intended to be made as open source), but having to manage that would bring 
complication and would make some contributors to go away.

"git log --follow" to be more exact due to renaming/moving around.

Don't introduce a CLA, that just raises the barrier to entry unnecessarily.

I personally refuse to sign them and opt to stop contributing to the
project in question.

This is quite a good summary of the situation:

I agree with Bas. I've been researching best practices into Open Source 
licenses of late, and I'm now against CLAs. Further reason for proj:

* If at least one of your contributors won't sign the CLA, then you 
won't be able to retrospectively collect all ownership rights and 
allocate them to an entity (such as OSGeo). Thanks Bas for stating that 
you would be one of those people and forcing the issue.

--

While I think the "do nothing" approach for proj would be best, you 
might want to consider adding a statement along the lines of:

"If you contribute to Proj, we assume you do so under the terms of the 
Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO): 
https://developercertificate.org/" <https://developercertificate.org/>

The DCO is typically implemented with each contributor signing their 
commit message, however, a statement above could be used instead (I 
don't have legal advice on whether this is acceptable).

It also doesn't address retrospectively applying this.

Cheers, Cameron

OK, I did the exercice of completing Kristian's initiated source file listing
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bdu73lw8I1iFX4cb7CIUF6yqWGDTcZKBfW0cUsEjCXk/edit#gid=0
Would be worth being double checked of course.

I've followed an "optimistic" principle, that is to say that we don't have issues
unless strong suspicion of the contrary: PROJ has always been released with
Copyright (c) 2000, Frank Warmerdam as the general license, so I think it is the
reasonable to consider this as the base to use for contributions
unless they state explicitly something else.
The general rules I followed in the case there's no explicit header with copyright & license are:
- files coming from initial commit by Frank in 1999 and present in PROJ 4.3 are copyright Frank
- files without explicit header and coming from SVN or git era are copyright their author
  when it can be recovered from the commit message, or otherwise the committer (Frank most of the times)
I've indicated those 2	situations in the remarks column.

There are a few lines underlined in yellow that might require follow up actions.

Message-ID: <5aa6bfbb-6a87-f5d7-2b8f-13fdd2e7436a@gmail.com>

Hello,

I have just build PROJ 6.2 under Windows 10, Visual Studio 2019 (in case 
this matters, I included all datum grids as availables here : 
https://proj.org/download.html )

All tests run well, except one on proj_test_cpp_api results :

[  FAILED  ] 1 test, listed below:
[  FAILED  ] operation.compoundCRS_to_compoundCRS_context

I've been checking in debug mode to try and follow what's happening, but 
i'm not really able to understand all steps. I can see the list is 152 
elements long which according to comments seems to be one of the 2 
psosibles list length.

The first elem as tested does not seems to be the expected one checked 
by the asserts, and in the end, the search loop does not find the 
expected element.

I've been compiling and checking the 6.1 code from github and I have the 
same behaviour. Is this a known "bug/regression" or is my build bad ?

Best regards,

Mathieu

That might be the issue. Some test steps are very sensitive to which grids are 
there or not. The continuous integration configurations only test with no 
grids at all, or with just the proj-datumgrid package.

Thanks for you input everyone.

Even, thanks for going through all of the source files! I had hoped to save some work
by crowdsourcing this, but never in a million years had I expected it to be done by
the time I got up the morning after. Very impressive. As far as I can tell there’s only
a minor issues to deal with.

We have a bunch of files without a license header present. The copyright holder
is inferred from the git log. Should we add headers to those files? Also, in many
files substantial work has been done by several developers, even though only
one is stated as the copyright holder. I assume because the developer has
forgotten to add their name in the header. We can also infer those from git, but
is that something that we ought to do?

Concerning the CLA, I take your responses as enough evidence that we do
not need one of those for the PROJ project :-) I have added the following
statement to the Provenance Review document:

"The project has opted to not ask committers to sign a contribution agreement
because 1) the MIT license is permissive which eliminates the desire to re-license
the software, 2) it's an added layer of complexity to the project and 3) some
developers has expressed that they will not sign such an agreement.”

You'll have assess whether the changes are eligible for copyright from
the diff, as trivial changes aren't copyrightable.

You don't have to add every author of changes, if they don't add a
copyright statement of their own, they may have just chosen to wave
their claim and implicitly grant it to the project.

Adding a copyright & license header on behalf of someone else is probably 
something we should not do without their explicit consent. As the project has 
a general COPYING file, that should cover those cases. I remember having seen 
discussions on the Incubation mailing list where it was said that having a 
per-file copyright&license information wasn't an obligation (I believe OSGeo 
received legal advice regarding this, but my memory can be wrong)

That said, I'd find it a good practice to require new contributions to have an 
explicit header.

I'm in line with Bas here. Retracing all activity in each file and determine 
which one is worth being copyrighted would be a lot of work.

I believe one of the main purposes of this provenance review is to check that 
we don't have files explicitly under a proprietary license or under an 
incompatible open source license (that's how I perceive
GDAL's https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/blob/master/gdal/PROVENANCE.TXT was 
established)

Let’s leave it at that. New files are required to include the license text at the top.
I’ll find somewhere relevant to put that info.

Definitely af lot of work. And I am happy to not do it if it is not required.

…and as far as I can tell we don’t have any problems. I will fill out the list
of copyright holders when I need a break from other work. With that, I think
we can declare the provenance review done. The logo is then the only thing
missing before we can submit the checklist to the incubation committee.

Just curious, what is the strategy chosen regarding EPSG data? They are
free for redistribution, but under some conditions that are a little bit
different than open-source licenses.

See the trac ticket for my take on it:

 https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/2268#comment:2

TL;DR: As long as the data is not attributed to the EPSG dataset, the
terms of the MIT license used for PROJ can also cover the SQL files and
resulting database.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Thanks for the link to the ticket. One minor correction:

To my knowledge, the first open-source project to support ISO 19162
(a.k.a. WKT2) was an ESRI prototype [1] and the second project was
Apache SIS [2] since 2017. PROJ is third. PROJ is however the first
project to my knowledge to implement the WKT2 update published in 2019,
but this is a relatively minor revision of ISO 19162:2015 (compared to
WKT 1).

On EPSG, can we really said that the data fail under MIT license because
we do not modify it? The EPSG terms of use said:

> You are obliged to inform anyone to whom you provide the EPSG
> Facilities of these Terms of Use.
So we need to inform users that they can not modify those data without
changing the EPSG name. And also that they can not extract the data and
sell them alone (without the added value of PROJ or other software).
Those conditions are not MIT terms.

The Apache Software Foundation legal team has debated about the
permission to include EPSG data in Apache software [3], and our
conclusion was that we can not provide them directly. We do that
indirectly by providing the data in a "non-free" package and require an
explicit action from users (which we try to make as simple as possible)
to get them.

Unless PROJ already modifies the data and doesn't attribute it to the
EPSG dataset. There is no epsg init file any more, there is proj.db now.

Not being a lawyer I cannot provide an authoritative answer, only my
interpretation.

I hope we can prevent this situation with proj, as we'll revert back to
the one with libgeotiff-epsg which few users installed despite needing it.

In the worst case scenario proj moves to non-free and everything that
depends on it to contrib, making them not part of Debian and loose QA
coverage, autobuilding and the like. This would be very harmful to users.

I would stick to the working theory until IOGP complains and proves us
otherwise.

Bas

On the "PROJ already modifies the data" part, that fact that PROJ
rewrites EPSG tables in a slightly different database structure is not
the essential thing. The EPSG terms of use allows such conversions
provided that data are numerically equivalent. The proj.db file in PROJ
6 is (to my knowledge) compliant with this condition, which is a very
good thing.

On the "doesn't attribute it to the EPSG dataset" part, in my
understanding we are attributing those definitions to EPSG dataset as
long as we use the "EPSG" authority name in "EPSG::4326", or that the
documentation claims to support EPSG codes. But since PROJ 6 is
compliant, this is not a problem.

The issue is that EPSG wants all users downstream to continue to comply
to those conditions, which is why they want us to inform users. I'm not
a lawyer neither, but my understanding of discussions I have seen at
Apache and at OGC (including with IOGP staffs) is that packaging the
same data in a different format does not erase EPSG ownership on those data.

Of course this is only my point of view. But maybe a verification by
someone more familiar than me on legal topics would be desirable.

Regards,

Message-ID: <CAOer1xDGeVeS-k+BzE68S5oH2mJqr1Bd1JWtqkPQvtfub6ELpQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

Following a discussion with Kristian in late 2018 , i am glad to finally
share a few logotypes for your consideration. I fully agree that PROJ needs
a logo and that would be the perfect touch for upcoming incubation :)

https://nbozon.github.io/OSGeo/proj/PROJ_logo_proposal.pdf

This is a draft proposal at this stage, and i would be glad to work further
on one particular logo that you may like, using the community feedbacks.

Please note:

- These are only logotypes. Logotexts can also be created, or the 'PROJ'
word may be added to any of these (this involves we may select a particular
open font).

- These are simple SVG shapes provided in black color for now
   (Colors can of course be proposed later on, if you like one of these)

- This work is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 at this stage, but i am happy to
create new version using a more permissive license if needed.

- I have more SVG drafts based on the 'P' letter, as well as additional
ideas using axis and coords elements, but i unfortunately can't shared them
for now.

- I am sharing this document as PDF for the sake of simplicity, but i am
happy to provide the source SVG at a later stage, along different formats
so we could easily reuse it on website and OSGeo marketing material.

This is only a simple proposal and i hope you will like it.
I am looking for your feedbacks, and will be glad to use one of these in
order to create the perfect logo, with colors and text.

Best regards,

Nick

https://nbozon.github.io/OSGeo/proj/PROJ_logo_proposal.pdf

This is a draft proposal at this stage, and i would be glad to work further on one particular logo that you may like, using the community feedbacks.

Please note:

- These are only logotypes. Logotexts can also be created, or the 'PROJ' word may be added to any of these (this involves we may select a particular open font).

- These are simple SVG shapes provided in black color for now
   (Colors can of course be proposed later on, if you like one of these)

- This work is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 at this stage, but i am happy to create new version using a more permissive license if needed.

- I have more SVG drafts based on the 'P' letter, as well as additional ideas using axis and coords elements, but i unfortunately can't shared them for now.

- I am sharing this document as PDF for the sake of simplicity, but i am happy to provide the source SVG at a later stage, along different formats so we could easily reuse it on website and OSGeo marketing material.

This is only a simple proposal and i hope you will like it.
I am looking for your feedbacks, and will be glad to use one of these in order to create the perfect logo, with colors and text.

Best regards,

Nick

The CC-BY-NC license makes the logo non-free because it discriminates
against fields of endeavour (commercial use).

CC-BY or CC-BY-SA v3 or later is a better choice.

Hi Sebastiaan,

Thank you for sharing your concern about licensing.

I deliberately selected the CC BY-NC license in order to protect my ideas a
bit, while the PSC will collect different logos.

You may guess that other designers may jump in, and i am especially not
comfortable with those external to our community seeking to sell graphic
design ( see https://twitter.com/kojxzGFX/status/1171372239972757504 for
example ..).

I am doing design work for OSGeo on my free time and on a volunteer basis,
so i wouldn't like if someone would 'steal' and resell these ideas anywhere
else :)
Sorry for such paranoia, but it happens all the time, especially during
logo contests and on **not recommended at all** creative platforms...

That said, i will be most delighted to provide the final logo as CC-BY-SA,
if any.
I hope you still like the proposed logos :)  Is any of them got your
preference ?

Best,

Nick

That must definitely happen if the logo will be included in the PROJ
release tarballs, otherwise those will need to be repacked to exclude
the logo to make them acceptable for inclusion in the Debian archive.

Yes, 1A because it's neutral unlike 1B which only shows the Americas.

Hi Nick,

+1 for 1A
I like the idea of a letter P consisting of a ruler and a globe too. So, I am interested in your additional drafts.

Subject: [PROJ] PROJ grid files CDN
Message-ID: <BCDDC1A0-7B9A-4C46-91C4-7BF7C1EFB1A7@hobu.co>

All,

A few days ago, I tweeted [1] looking for a CDN partner to help us incrementally distribute the shift files that PROJ uses. After that generated some connections from organizations willing to help, I'm now asking the community if there is support for such an idea.

The current software approach PROJ uses to apply grid shifts works just fine, but it has one significant deficiency that can cause PROJ to generate "incorrect" results – the need for proper grid shift files. Incorrect results can happen due to missing shift data that users didn't know they needed to download and put in a magical directory. Some distributions do not ship full copies of the shift files due to their size, and new versions of the grid shift files are released at a different release cadence than the releases of distributions, the EPSG database, or PROJ itself.

The current management of the grid shift files would be improved for many users by providing an optional online web service alternative for obtaining shift information. Some benefits of a web service approach include:

* users no longer have to manually fetch grid files and place them in PROJ_LIB
* full and accurate capability of the software would no longer require GBs of grid shift files
* the web service can manage and provide proper versioning for the shift files
* cache build up of the grid files could happen lazily so users end up locally mirroring what they actually use

I recognize that many do not want PROJ reaching out to a web service, and I would propose that the machinery to do this would be optionally compiled and optionally activated via environment variable or some similar mechanism. However, a significant portion of don't-even-know-they're-using-PROJ users could benefit from PROJ having the optional ability to do its best in application of grid shifts.  

Does the PROJ community support such an idea? How does management of grid shift data impact your ability to use PROJ, and what ideas do you have to help us improve it?  If the feedback on this proposal is generally positive, I will work with Even on writing an RFC of a proposed implementation.

Willing to help vs committed to help it is a big difference.

I support such an idea, but not through a voluntary base, maybe through
OSGeo somehow?

My email may not have been so clear. I can make the technical implementation of this proposal happen, but without community support of the idea, it would be wasted effort. It would also be impolite to simply dump code implementing this into the codebase without first having some community discussion about what it hopes to achieve. My email looks for feedback on the idea and whether it brings up any technical or cultural challenges.

I understand that it is a different conversation but i cannot stop to
wonder that it would be also wasted effort if down the road the CDN
providers ask for a reasonable amount of money to sustain their services
when all proj users use their resources to fetch grid files.

Technically, I am still trying to cope with the build changes proj brought
to some frameworks/libraries, so as long it's **optional**, hey it's good
to have ;)

Out of curiosity, is there any other project with similar approach as the
one suggested?

Fair point. I would think an organization like OSGeo could step forward (especially after we complete OSGeo project incubation) to provide the resources to cover in that situation.

Many, if not most, of the popular JavaScript libraries use CDNs as their primary distribution mechanism with the network and storage resources contributed by the CDNs themselves. The Python project uses Fastly, for example. I don't think we would be treading any new ground with the approach.

I think that this thread is related to the later CDN thread here: 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2019-September/008858.html

This earlier thread addressed where to put the downloaded grids (adding 
that path to the existing search path), with a suggestion to use an XDG 
discovery mechanism that could be shared across applications but located 
in user space unless otherwise specified. The CDN thread addresses the 
mechanisms for serving the grids. It seems as though a CDN would be 
superior in many settings to manual download and unpacking of selected 
grids from datumgrid zip archives.

Hi Howard

application of grid shifts.

If the remote update feature will require extra build time configuration or
environment configuration, how will these users benefit? If you don't know
you're using PROJ, how do you know to enable this? Don't these users need
it on by default?

I think there are also security considerations. Is PROJ proofed against
malicious grid files like our browsers are against malicious javascript?

Somewhat off topic: should PROJ be returning incorrect results in the
absence of grid files? Should it not raise an exception instead?

That raises several issues:

  I really don't understand the notion of incorrect results from missing
  shift files as other than a bug.  I know we've discussed this before,
  but it seems that a transform that needs grid files should use grid
  files, and fail if they are not there.  I realize there is some notion
  of lower and higher accuracy transforms, but it seems dangerous to
  have different outcomes based on grids being installed (vs flags
  asking to not use them).  I acknowledge that this is a preference to
  repeatable results over convenience.

  One issue with grids seems to be licensing.  I have not investigated
  deeply, but it seems some have terms that make it difficult to
  distribute, and some are non-Free (being an issue for Debian, perhaps,
  an in pkgsrc requiring a non-Free license tag, sort of the same
  thing).  Are all of the grids you are talking about able to be
  distributed (verbatim) via no-cost internet downloads?  As part of a
  paid-for CDROM that aggregates many things?

  My impression is that grids are not included in proj packages because
  they are large, in addition to the above.

  In general, within the context of a packaging system, the right thing
  for additional files is to have packages for them, rather than
  inventing a sort of packaging system managed by some particular
  program.

  I don't follow the release cadence point at all.  Yes, proj has
  releases, grid shifts have releases, and these all make their way into
  packaging systems, which then have releases.  Generally people want to
  run more recent versions, except for some people that choose to run
  old software (which they call LTS).

  Your point about packaging systems not having grid shift packages due
  to size is fair; it's not clear how to deal with that.

Further issues:

  Generally, packaging systems install proj in a system directory, such
  that regular users cannot write the directories and files.  So a user
  running proj would not be able to write to the system proj directory.
  Do you envision the files going into some per-user directory in their
  homedir?

  Generally, packaging systems consider it a bug when programs in
  packages do automatic downloading.  Partly this is because one should
  be able to install a package to an offline computer.

  If what you're really talking about first is a CDN URL to download
  grids, mirroring the current download area, that sounds fine, but it
  seems somewhat separable from the autodownload notion.

Agreed that if it happens it should be opt in.

Good point.  It seems that proj releases then need hashes of grids;
perhaps they should be fetched by hash.

Good point. I can imagine that an application with a GUI such as QGIS could 
ask the question to the user "QGIS might download resource files needed for 
coordinate transformation. Do you agree ?", and if they approve, set the 
appropriate environment variable.

A realistic use case for this download-on-demand capaibility is that you know 
that PROJ exists, that you are going to use it, but you don't know in advance 
which part(s) of the world you're going to work on, and don't want to / cannot 
download data for the whole world in advance.

In that context, one should indeed have a deeper look at how it opens them and 
try to secure that (with the curent raw formats which are quite simple, that 
shouldn't be too challenging). That said, the resources it would fetch would 
not be random, so unless a hostile party manages to upload a corrupted file in 
the CDN storage (or changes entries in the local proj.db), the set of what is 
access should be rather well defined.

Note: those concerns about security are already valid currently. For example 
if using a PROJ string with a geoidgrids/nadgrids parameter that points to a 
local file that would be hostile.

There's no such thing as a "correct result" regarding coordinate 
transformation that involve changes of datum. There are results that are more 
or less accurate given the possibilities offered in the database which are 
themselves somewhat arbitrarily available according to what national geodetic 
agencies have provided to EPSG, which tranformation methods are actually 
implemented in PROJ, etc. So depending on what is available and what your 
needs are, you could get a result that is correct with an accuracy of 100m, 
10m, 1m, 1cm...
In reality, the difference of accuracy between using a 7-parameter Helmert 
transformation vs using a grid is quite often 1m vs 10cm, so raising an 
exception when the grid is not there could be over-zealous if the user hasn't 
required a particular level of acuracy and the result given by the 7-parameter 
Helmert is just fine for them.
The lower level services of PROJ can give you the available possibilities, 
with their accuracy and if some resources are missing or not, and where they 
can be downloaded.

That's why I scare quoted "incorrect", and Even's reply covers it thoroughly. If we were to error in the face of missing grids, the only thing a user without system access can do is to fully replicate PROJ_LIB somewhere locally and then copy in their own grids. It is massively inconvenient and easy to screw up.

I propose we wouldn't distribute anything via CDN that wouldn't meet Debian's notion of "free", and I would think that a distribution approach like this, if especially convenient, would encourage some of the licensing laggards of grids to follow along.

If you were to carefully inspect some of the paid-for CDROMs being distributed today, you're likely going to find these grid files regardless of the specific licensing language on some specific grids.

Yes that's correct. They can be huge for the full set. That's why I'm proposing allowing a lazily-fetched CDN approach.

You practically never want old grid data, unless you're trying to replicate something that happened in the past. This also brings up the problem of versioning of the grids, which is not handled currently.

>  Your point about packaging systems not having grid shift packages due  to size is fair; it's not clear how to deal with that.

Let the packagers continue to bulk copy the redistributable grids into packages and place them in PROJ_LIB. Fully unzipped, its ~650mb and growing. They can snap their packages and versions from the CDN.

Implementation detail, but yes, something like that.

That's why I propose it to be compile-time and runtime off-by-default. Specific packaging systems will have to determine if it is worth it to its users to do this. For front-end user-oriented applications where the users are not typically versed in the minutiae of geodesic transforms, I suspect the answer will be yes.

I would think people could enable some PROJ_APPROXIMATE_OK environment
variable to proceed without grids.  Perhaps with a GUI helper.

So what are you doing to do about grids that don't allow redistribution?
Some scheme to help people download from the original place?

What about grids that do not allow redistribution of modified copies?  I
would think there's a lot of that.  (The EPSG database seems non-Free,
but we aren't really dealing with that either.)

What people do contrary to terms is not really relevant.  I meant to
inquire about the actual terms, not whether other people routinely
violate them.  But if you are limiting to data that meets DFSG, that's
not relevant.  And, the CDROM thing has the same issue regardless of any
over-the-net fetching scheme.

That's also true about old buggy software; one should not want that
either but people do.

But, I'd say that there is a larger problem, which is versions of grid
data.  It seems blindingly obvious that any data that is released should
be versioned, for all the usual reasons of knowing what you have,
knowing if you have to get new data, and recording an identifier for
what you used, for repeating calculations, understanding what happened,
etc.

I would suggest fixing the lack of versioning bugs first, before getting
into any autofetch stuff.  Surely with a CDN you want files with unique
names that never change anyway.

I really don't understand the emphasis on CDN.  The big issues here are
having versions and a naming scheme, as well as a standard for how files
unpack and portable representions (not varying based on CPU type, word
size, and endianness0 and having a central place to get files from.

Then, a CDN solves the problem of not being able to handle or pay for
the bandwidth to that one place by caching.  But it's just an
optimization for fetching and does not bear on the actual hard problems,
as I see it.

OK - so multiple users would have multiple copies.   I'm not saying
that's terrible, but bears discussing/thinking.

Two separate issues:

  a file with an exploit

  just getting the wrong data.  packaging systems usually have crypto
  checksums, and hence I suggested having hashes.

But still, there is a notion that:

  With this input, and this conversion string, I ran proj, and I
  (silently) got different results.

So it's not that the output is wrong in an egregious sense, it is that
that it's different in a way which perhaps should be controlled and
isn't.

The fact that since version 6, PROJ now has the capability to describe
the operation that it performs (thanks to WKT 2), may change the
perspective. This description includes whether the operation uses grid
files or other methods, together with accuracy information. There is an
education to do with the users, for encouraging them to look at this WKT
string when they have doubts about what is going on. Is a grid file
used? Is axis order the expected one? Is the transformation time-depend?
Do I'm inside the operation domain of validity? I think it should almost
become a reflex to ask users "What is your coordinate operation WKT"
when an issue is suspected. In GeoTools, it was hugely helpful.

Thanks for the explanation, Even!

I think I'll be in roughly the same situation as QGIS developers. Have you
and Howard considered grids-on-demand as a PROJ API that developers could
use in QGIS or Rasterio or gdalwarp? Or as a service like DNS? Something
about having it built into the library feels not right to me. I'm trying to
think of a precedent for this and am drawing a blank.

I have imagined that the network layer could be an interface, with a default 
libcurl implementation, that applications/libraries could subsitute with their 
own.
As some grids can be pretty big and we don't necessarily want to download them 
in their entirety, that could be something like
DownloadRange(url, start_offset, length)
One use case where this solution is kind of compulsory is if you have to do 
coordinate reprojection in a context like AWS Lambda with a very small 
footprint for the application.

Thanks Sylvain. My preference would go to 2B, but perhaps with a uppercase J.
Wondering if it wouldn't be better to enlarge a bit the green plane so that 
all letters (especially the P) are on it ?

Thanks Sylvain,

These are indeed some good logo proposals. Like Even I also like the 2B/9A logo. I also like the 5B version. It would be interesting to see a combination of 5B and 9A. I like the wireframe globe and the red from 5B.

Thank you Nicolas for sharing your logo proposals with the mailing list. They are all good suggestions for a new PROJ logo. Like Sebastiaan I also prefer your 1A logo. I like that it conveys the principle nature of the original PROJ software: Turn a sphere into a plane. The neutral version in 1A seems the best choice given that PROJ is used all over the globe.

I will start a follow-up email thread in about a week and sum up the proposals that have been presented and the comments they have gotten. I will chose a few candidates based on the response from the community and come up with some form of voting scheme so we can choose the logo that the community likes the best. Ultimately the new logo will have to be approved by the PSC (this is my Boaty McBoatface safety measure).

/Kristian

Subject: [PROJ] PROJ logo proposal

Hi list,

Following a discussion with Kristian in late 2018 , i am glad to finally share a few logotypes for your consideration. I fully agree that PROJ needs a logo and that would be the perfect touch for upcoming incubation :)

https://nbozon.github.io/OSGeo/proj/PROJ_logo_proposal.pdf

This is a draft proposal at this stage, and i would be glad to work further on one particular logo that you may like, using the community feedbacks.

Please note:

- These are only logotypes. Logotexts can also be created, or the 'PROJ' word may be added to any of these (this involves we may select a particular open font).

- These are simple SVG shapes provided in black color for now
   (Colors can of course be proposed later on, if you like one of these)

- This work is licensed under CC BY-NC 4.0 at this stage, but i am happy to create new version using a more permissive license if needed.

- I have more SVG drafts based on the 'P' letter, as well as additional ideas using axis and coords elements, but i unfortunately can't shared them for now.

- I am sharing this document as PDF for the sake of simplicity, but i am happy to provide the source SVG at a later stage, along different formats so we could easily reuse it on website and OSGeo marketing material.

This is only a simple proposal and i hope you will like it.
I am looking for your feedbacks, and will be glad to use one of these in order to create the perfect logo, with colors and text.

Best regards,

Nick

Thank you! I’ve come to the conclusion that of your proposals I like 5B the best. I like the wire-frame globe and that the plane below it is sort of the projected footprint of the globe. Additionally I like that the colors are simple (no shades and gradients) which I believe is more suitable for a logo. Additionally the red can be replaced with other colors depending on the context, for instance the OSGeo website which uses a black and green colorscheme.

Bit late to this thread, sorry. While I think the proposal will be
very useful in some circumstances, it's not a fix-all and it's still
going to be very important for client applications to warn their users
whenever a grid is desirable but not available and provide some
user-friendly method to do this.

I'm thinking specifically of offline users here, or those with
unreliable/expensive internet connections. For these users it's
critical that they are alerted about missing grids instead of just
silently falling back to an inferior operation.

And we should also consider releasing all-in-one packages of end user
applications which include ALL the datum grid packages, so that users
who require an offline installer will be guaranteed to have these
available... (again, thinking of someone who goes out to the field in
a remote location without regular internet connections).

I am unconvinced (or actually rather strictly against) the “globe and
plane” style logo candidates: They focus too narrowly on the projection
side of things, which is already indicated quite clearly through the name
PROJ.

I kind of like 3C, with the phi and its shadow - the shadow somehow
indicating a “related but not identical reference frame”, i.e. a datum
shift.

I do, however, not like the shape of the phi (or actually “varphi”: phi is
the “O with bar strikethrough” often used to indicate a clock phase): The
very open-to-the-left varphi looks too much like the word “up”.

I would like the logo to indicate more clearly that geodesy is a
four-dimensional science, and the operations PROJ provide support that.

So perhaps something like 3C, but with the letters “P R O J” casting the
shadows “varphi lambda H t” - or for the sake of simplicity and
recognizability in small sizes: Just the four letters “varphi lambda H t”
on one line, and “P R O J” below that:

φλHt

PROJ

(where the phi was supposed to be a varphi)

It may be a challenge to make it work graphically, since varphi descends,
and lambda, H and t ascends - but I am sure this can be made to work by
someone more graphically skilled than myself.

Hi,

Thanks Thomas for your feebacks.

Here are a few new tries (work in progress) :

inspired by your suggestions.

Sylvain,

Thank you for taking the time to create these logos! My preference would be
9A and 9B (on a green plane).

Thank you again,
Christina

Bonjour Sylvain,

Thanks for another batch of hard work from you!

10B works surprisingly well, with the phi giving a quite convincing
impression of the Earth and its axis of rotation. It does, however, not
really hit the 4D point.
11A is, in my opinion, very good - extremely clear, both graphically and
communication wise. I would probably suggest a slightly darker shade of
grey for the coordinate designations (but you have probably tried that and
found it worse)
11B is a nice humorous take. I see why it probably won't work with a varphi
instead of the plain phi - but would like to see that as well if you have
tried it out already.

All in all, as of right now, I prefer the elegant, expressive and
recognizable 11A, which will probably work extremely well in any size and
angle, and provoke the right questions.

I think 10B is pretty great, it shrinks well, and the phi would make a good
favicon. My only suggestion as a non-designer who knows nothing is to make
the phi a little more "earthy", but I've no idea how to do that.

Logos that are little maps don't shrink very well, and they are
non-descript from all the other geo logos that are little maps. 10B is
abstract enough that it doesn't have that problem but it still communicates
an essence about the project.

Thank you so much for these.

Howard

Thanks for the feedbacks so far !

Please find an updated version of this proposal at the same link:
https://nbozon.github.io/OSGeo/proj/PROJ_logo_proposal.pdf

It extends my initial idea of a Sphere On A Plane, and brings full logo
examples as well.
Any shape, color or font can of course be modified according to your
suggestions.

Best regards,

Nick

Howard, one way to make it "a little more earthy" would be to tilt the phi
(and hence,
the imagined rotation axis) by 23 degrees (or whatever works best in
practice) to mimic
the actual tilt of the Earth spin axis wrt the orbital plane. Not that "the
average person"
would recognize the tilt of the earth - but they would recognize the tilt
of a globe.

I'll add a vote in favor of 10B: it is simple, distinctive (I think), and
adequately suggestive--after all, there is only so much information you can
imply in a logo (even that the phi is a phi and this is a meaningful
variable). To get all of what is in proj, you'd need
glyphs for a a globe, a plane, and a time-dependent Helmert
transformation--along with the name. Maybe proj needs a seal
and a logo (see
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/uc-logo-fail-new-unpopular-design_n_2293610
for the difference, as well as
a case of logo design gone bad, from my own institution).

I like the tilted phi idea.

Here are examples of tilted earths that could resemble a tilted phi:

I like 7C better. It has the advantage of the aspect ratio (almost square).

Sylvain,

 

Thank you for taking the time to create these logos! My preference would be 9A and 9B (on a green plane).

 

Thank you again,

Hi,

 

Thanks Thomas for your feebacks.

 

Here are a few new tries (work in progress) : http://dakitanmonkey.2tokiislands.com/proj_logos_4.png (lines 10 and 11), inspired by your suggestions.

I am unconvinced (or actually rather strictly against) the “globe and plane” style logo candidates: They focus too narrowly on the projection side of things, which is already indicated quite clearly through the name PROJ.

 

I kind of like 3C, with the phi and its shadow - the shadow somehow indicating a “related but not identical reference frame”, i.e. a datum shift.

 

I do, however, not like the shape of the phi (or actually “varphi”: phi is the “O with bar strikethrough” often used to indicate a clock phase): The very open-to-the-left varphi looks too much like the word “up”.

 

I would like the logo to indicate more clearly that geodesy is a four-dimensional science, and the operations PROJ provide support that.

 

So perhaps something like 3C, but with the letters “P R O J” casting the shadows “varphi lambda H t” - or for the sake of simplicity and recognizability in small sizes: Just the four letters “varphi lambda H t” on one line, and “P R O J” below that:

 

φλHt

PROJ

 

(where the phi was supposed to be a varphi)

 

It may be a challenge to make it work graphically, since varphi descends, and lambda, H and t ascends - but I am sure this can be made to work by someone more graphically skilled than myself.

Thank you! I’ve come to the conclusion that of your proposals I like 5B the best. I like the wire-frame globe and that the plane below it is sort of the projected footprint of the globe. Additionally I like that the colors are simple (no shades and gradients) which I believe is more suitable for a logo. Additionally the red can be replaced with other colors depending on the context, for instance the OSGeo website which uses a black and green colorscheme.

These are indeed some good logo proposals. Like Even I also like the 2B/9A logo. I also like the 5B version. It would be interesting to see a combination of 5B and 9A. I like the wireframe globe and the red from 5B.

Thanks Sylvain. My preference would go to 2B, but perhaps with a uppercase J.
Wondering if it wouldn't be better to enlarge a bit the green plane so that 
all letters (especially the P) are on it ?

I feel the same as Nyall, that users of PROJ need to be alerted when a 
grid file is missing.

In the case of MS4W, I package all of the grids for Windows users, since 
there is no notification for Windows users who lack those files.  I 
think once the warning/notice is implemented, this will mean packagers 
like me won't have to package all of the grid files anymore, since users 
will be notified and can then download the files themselves.

Are those expected ? Could it comes from my buildbox (Solaris 11.4.12) ?


Thanks

Hi

Definitely a Solaris specific thing.
Should hopefully be fixed by https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/1637
Can you confirm this patch fixes the issue ?

I am afraid it is not enough. Please find attached 4 additional patches :

     - proj-6.2.0-hanato.gpatch and proj-6.2.0-mbtfpp.gpatch

In files src/projections/hatano.cpp and src/projections/mbtfpp.cpp, 
change the CS define to CSz in order to avoid overriding the CS system 
definition

     - proj-6.2.0-isea.gpatch :

In file src/projections/isea.cpp, change the quad variable name as it is 
overriding another system definition

$ grep quad  /usr/include/sys/types.h
typedef struct _quad { int val[2]; } quad_t;    /* used by UFS */
typedef quad_t          quad;                   /* used by UFS */

     - proj-6.2.0-io.gpatch

In file src/iso19111/io.cpp, change another class name that override the 
CS system define

$ gegrep '[[:space:]]CS[[:space:]]' /usr/include/sys/regset.h
#define CS              15



With those changes, 6.2.0 build and check properly on Solaris 11.4.12 
and GCC 9.1.

Note : I quite understood what I changed in the first 3 patches. Not 
sure in the last one. Can you please review it ?


Regards.

I don't understand this one. It's not a macro, so the inner scope
identifier should shadow the outer one.
See https://godbolt.org/z/ZQKPKo

Maybe it would be better to figure out how and why this header is
included, and then disable it, since it's defined several macros which
seem useless for Proj.

I'm quite surprised about that one. The compiler should be smart enough to see 
that in "int quad;" quad is a variable name, not a struct. Which error message 
do you get exactly ?

Can you try to compile the following test.cpp file ?

```
typedef struct _quad { int val[2]; } quad_t;    /* used by UFS */
typedef quad_t          quad;                   /* used by UFS */

struct foo
{
    int quad;
};

int main()
{
    int quad = 0;
    return quad;
}
```

$ g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -c

Works fine on Linux. If adding, -Wshadow, it will complain though about the 
int quad = 0 shadowing the global declaration of typedef quad_t quad;


>      - proj-6.2.0-io.gpatch

It is essentially the same as my pull request, or am I missing somethig ?

Which one do you mean by the last one, the one for io.cpp ?

This exact code does not produce any error or warning. With -Wshadow 
enabled, it produce the followingoutput :

$ g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test -Wshadow
test.cpp: In function 'int main()':
test.cpp:11:9: warning: declaration of 'quad' shadows a global 
declaration [-Wshadow]
    11 |     int quad = 0;
       |         ^~~~
test.cpp:2:25: note: shadowed declaration is here
     2 | typedef quad_t          quad;                   /* used by UFS */
       |                         ^~~~

The patch only removes the warning.

Yes, io.ccp. The patch applies above your pull request and change the CS 
class name in two templates

  template <class TargetCRS, class DatumBuilderType,
               class CS = CoordinateSystem>
      util::nn<std::shared_ptr<TargetCRS>>

and

template <class TargetCRS, class BaseCRS, class CS = CoordinateSystem>

Here is the include stack, I don't think much can be done :

/usr/include/sys/types.h
/usr/include/sys/wait.h:12,
/usr/include/stdlib.h:16,
/usr/gcc/9/include/c++/9.1.0/bits/std_abs.h:38,
/usr/gcc/9/include/c++/9.1.0/cmath:47,
/usr/gcc/9/include/c++/9.1.0/math.h:36,
projections/isea.cpp:7:

That's exactly what my yesterday pull request against master does:
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/pull/1637/files

(perhaps you were mentionning the older commit from February
https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/commit/2f8bd934860b135044c5122e3272f7cc41ba81e7 
that is already in 6.2.0)

Subject: [PROJ] Starting JNI wrappers - a few questions
Message-ID: <d1268ca3-985b-21e3-dc89-b521b19c5001@geomatys.com>

Hello all

I'm starting the development of Java Native Interface (JNI) for PROJ on 
a separated GitHub repository [1], with completion date targeted for 
December. We have chosen to use the C++ API instead than the C API, even 
if the C API may be more stable, for the following reasons:

  * Straightforward mapping to ISO 19111 objects. The C API in
    comparison uses a conceptual model which is particular to PROJ.
  * It seems possible to wrap the C++ objects into classical PJ
    structures using the PJ.iso_obj field, but it seems to impose a
    significant overhead (e.g. the process of wrapping an ISO 19111
    object into a PJ involves formatting the object in a PROJ string and
    parsing it in PJ).
  * Many (not all) C++ objects are immutable, which make easier to be
    thread-safe.

I have a first series of questions in order to help me to make some 
design choices. Can anyone gives some tips on the following?


    PJ_CONTEXT

I understand that a given PJ_CONTEXT can be used by only one thread at a 
time. But after a thread has (at least temporarily) finished to use a 
PJ_CONTEXT, can that PJ_CONTEXT be given to another thread (making sure 
that no other thread uses it in same time), or is it preferable to 
restrict the use of a PJ_CONTEXT to the thread that created it?

Are PJ_CONTEXT expected to be short lived (extreme case: a 
create/destroy cycle in a each JNI call), long lived (e.g. the whole 
lifetime of a Java Virtual Machine), or something between the two (e.g. 
I could setup a pool of PJ_CONTEXT which automatically destroys 
instances that were unused for more than 2 minutes)? I guess the answer 
depends on the cost of PJ_CONTEXT create/destroy cycles compared to the 
cost of holding them a long time.

Above questions are because I wish to avoid exposing PJ_CONTEXT in Java 
API, and instead have them managed automatically.


    Disposal at shutdown time

What is the consequence if an application using PROJ exits without 
destroying all PROJ objects? Is there a risk that PROJ leaves some files 
(e.g. related to the use of SQLite) in a locked or corrupted state? I 
ask because by default, Java does not wait for all objects to be garbage 
collected when an application terminates. If we need to ensure that all 
PROJ objects are properly destroyed at exit time, then I need to 
register a shutdown hook for them (not a difficult task - I'm just 
checking if it is necessary).


    Encoding of std::string

The C++ API has many methods expecting or returning a std::string 
object. In my reading of C++ specification, std::string seems to be 
encoding agnostic. Does PROJ makes any assumption on the encoding of 
std::string instances? Is it okay to unconditionally use UTF-8 
regardless the platform encoding when using std::string with PROJ API? 
Or should I unconditionally convert UTF-8 to platform encoding before to 
build a std::string?

     Thanks,

You can use a PJ_CONTEXT created by one thread in another thread. The golden 
rule is not to use in more than one thread at the same time as you stated 
above.

Rather long lived. The PJ_CONTEXT caches the sqlite3 database handle, and even 
higher level objects. So createOperations() performance would suffer if you 
start from a new PJ_CONTEXT everytime.

There shouldn't be any problem to just exit the JVM without terminating PROJ. 
The sqlite3 handle is on a read-only file, and only read-only operations are 
done, so nothing to corrupt.

UTF-8 is more or less implied. The EPSG database is ingested from a UTF-8 
dump. People could potentially try to ingest non UTF-8 strings in import from 
WKT, but we could/should just state in the documentation that all strings 
ingested are expected to be UTF-8 (in which case all strings output by PROJ 
will be UTF-8 as well)

Thanks Even for the tips; I will design accordingly (pool of relatively 
long lived PJ_CONTEXT, encoding assumed UTF-8). More questions to come 
maybe next week.

Subject: [PROJ] Minor suggestion for
	AuthorityFactory::getDescriptionText(code)
Message-ID: <2a44b2bb-12b2-fb81-bc5a-0483abc98f00@geomatys.com>

Hello

In the C++ API, the documentation of 
AuthorityFactory::getDescriptionText said: "In case of several objects 
of different types with the same code, one of them will be arbitrarily 
selected." This is fine. But the following code with PROJ 6.2.0:

    factory->getDescriptionText("3395");

returns /"Germany - Saxony - west of 13.5°E"/ while I would have 
expected /"WGS 84 / World Mercator"/. Technically the result is conform 
to PROJ documentation since the former is an Area object with EPSG:3395 
code, and the later is a ProjectedCRS object also with EPSG:3395 code. 
But I suggest that in such case where different kinds of object have the 
same EPSG code, precedence is given to the CRS.

Likewise, getDescriptionText("4326") currently produces /"USA - 
Wisconsin - Douglas"/. I have not yet verified if such precedence should 
also be enforced in AuthorityFactory::createObject.

Subject: [PROJ] Datum Grids, Which Ones?
Message-ID: <BD719EC9-6196-4107-9B6C-DD16CB6981D3@cleverelephant.ca>

The list of datum grids on the web side is not 100% clear on what grids a person should pull for what purpose…
There’s regional files (europe and na and oceania) there’s a “world” file which, by size, perhaps includes all of the above? and there’s the un-specialized file, proj-datumgrid that is… everything not in the other files? something else?


• 2018-09-15 proj-datumgrid-1.8.zip

• 2019-09-01 proj-datumgrid-europe-1.4.zip

• 2019-03-01 proj-datumgrid-north-america-1.2.zip

• 2018-03-01 proj-datumgrid-oceania-1.0.zip

• 2019-03-01 proj-datumgrid-world-1.0.zip

If the best practice is just “download’em’all if you have the space”, then an “all” might be good, instead of “world”. And some note on what proj-datumgrid-1.8.zip actually is? Is it for Proj < 6 only?

Yes, this could do with some clarification in the docs. Briefly, it goes something like this:

proj-datumgrid is the original datumgrid packages. It contains mostly basic North American grids,
a few European grids and the egm96 geoid model. The test suite will fail without this. Many
transformations will work without it. These days this package is mostly kept for legacy reasons.

The regional grid packages contain grids and other resources that are useful in those regions.
Currently three regions are covered. The grids are split in these packages to avoid consuming
too much disk space for users who has that concern. If you have plenty of space just get all of them.

The world package is for grids that has global coverage. Currently only the egm08_25.gtx grid is
in that package. It is NOT a package containing all grids of the world.


We have previously talked about adding a -all package which holds everything. This will be easier
for most people to use it seems. I haven’t gotten around to it because it requires changing the
CMake setup of the proj-datumgrids repository [0] and that is just not a job that I am particularly keen
on doing. A pull requests adding this is welcome.

Finally, Howard is trying to find the funds to deal with grids in a smarter way. I suggest that those
who can support his effort.

So, just as a confirmation: being a stupid ape and just blindly installing every datumgrid.zip file I can get my hand on will lead to the “best” results?

Yes. And it is not unreasonable for a application such as PostGIS to have all
the packages as a requirement. Other applications may want to leave that
responsibility to the user or simply just require a specific regional packages.
