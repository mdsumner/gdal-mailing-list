Is there an expedient way to convert OGC Well-Known Text SRS
representations to Proj4 representations? Even better, is it possible
Proj4 will support WKT directly in the future?

I am trying to put together an IMS-style front-end for mapserver and the
true sticking point looks like it will be projections: IMS-clients
expect to be able to ask for data in any projection they like, using WKT
to define the projection they want.

Paul,

PROJ.4 doesn't have these services, but they are available as services on

the OGRSpatialReference object.  It can read/write WKT and also transform to

PROJ.4.

Let me know if you need details.

Best regards,

I am afraid I am not a C, or C++ guru like you and Dave. The project I
am doing right now is perl-on-mapscript, and the requirement is to
direct mapserver to do projections using WKT. Since mapserver only does
proj4 ... I am sort of at a loss. I have started writing a perl parser,
but am sure there are more details in the conversion than namespace
changes.

In the long run, having proj4 do WKT directly seems like a nice goal.
That way things like mapserver which use proj4 directly could use WKT
for configuration.

One quick-and-easy detail you could give is a snippet which instantiates
the OGR object with a WKT string and then writes out the proj4 string...

Thanks,
Paul

Paul, 

OGRSpatialReference is linked into MapServer and used when the OGR link
is there.  We could look at some mechanism for exposing some of the
OGRSpatialReference capabilities to perl - they are already accessable
to
Python. 

We could make cases for it belonging in PROJ or not, but for the time
being
I don't expect it to happen. 

For your specific needs would it be adequate to have an external
executable
you could run to translate WKT into PROJ.4?  I could make you up such a
thing
pretty quickly.

Later,

That would be servicable for me to get something up and running ASAP,
which is really my goal right now... if we could expose some OGR to perl
in mapserver too, that would be great... is that not part of the swig .i
file?
Thanks very very much frank!

Paul, 

Here is a tiny program doing this in C++.  that's what you wanted,
right?

#include "ogr_spatialref.h"

int main()

{
    OGRSpatialReference      oSRS;
    char                     *pszProj4 = NULL;
    char                     *pszWKT = "GEOGCS[\"WGS
84\",DATUM[\"WGS_1984\",SPHEROID[\"WGS
84\",6378137,298.257223563,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",7030]],TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",6326]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",8901]],UNIT[\"DMSH\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",9108]],AXIS[\"Lat\",NORTH],AXIS[\"Long\",EAST],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",4326]]";

    oSRS.importFromWkt( &pszWKT );

    oSRS.exportToProj4( &pszProj4 );

    printf( "proj.4 = %s\n", pszProj4 );
}

Guys,

could the msOGCWKT2ProjectionObj() function, which is already in
mapogr.cpp be easily referenced from the scripting bindings?

Hi,

I am trying to run the ./configure command in the ".../proj-4.4.4/"
directory and all seems well until it hangs during the "creating
./config.status" process.

I am running on a Solaris 2.6 UNIX Sun machine, using gcc version
2.95.3.

Has anyone else had this problem or know why this hanging happens?

Thanks in advance for your reposnses.

is this implemented in proj.4? Maybe under a different name?
