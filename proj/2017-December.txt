Subject: [Proj] Inverse Icosahedral Snyder Equal Area (ISEA) Projection
Message-ID: <22abb8b8ab5642699e3419d4531c9add@nldataex01.ad.fugro.com>

Hello,

I am trying to implement the inverse ISEA projection documented in:

An Equal-Area Map Projection For Polyhedral Globes, John Snyder, October 1992
Cartographica The International Journal for Geographic Information and Geovisualization 29(1):10-21

For the purposes of my current project, I extended the code for the forward Snyder ISEA projection found at https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/src/PJ_isea.c to work with a rhombus-based Discrete Global Grid System (DGGS). I converted this from C to Python.
Now, I am trying to implement the inverse projection according to the description provided on page 14 of the above paper.
However, the problem is that the value for the spherical distance, z, is not getting properly calculated (it is about 0.5-2 units "off" from the value that results after using the forward ISEA formula for the same lat,long point). The azimuth Az, however, is getting properly calculated, and the only problem it seems is with the value of z. Therefore, the latitude and longitude of a point gets incorrectly calculated from the inverse, and is off by 50-100 kms from the true location.  I am attaching the main part of the Python code to this email, and it uses the same constants defined in the forward projection code.
If anyone can provide some guidance as to where I am going wrong, or what the problem could be, I would greatly appreciate it.  If any additional information is needed, please let me know.
Thanks,

Hi,

Following discussion in https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/708, I've initiated a new repo 
to host (heavy) grids :
https://github.com/OSGeo/projgrids

I've initiated it by just unzipping
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-datumgrid-1.6.zip

The aim is to avoid OSGeo/proj.4 to become too big as we add new grids and have a way to 
better track changes and discuss new addition propositions through pull requests

Looking a bit at things, it seems some cleanup could be possible.

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/tree/master/nad and
https://github.com/OSGeo/projgrids contain a few duplicated files:
* ntf_r93.gsb
* ntv1_can.dat
* nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb
(binary identical in both repo)

And proj.4/tree/master/nad contains null.lla which is the source of the
OSGeo/projgrids/null file (actually projgrids/null is a 'non clean' version of the result of the 
compilation of null.lla, with some garbage in a unused area of the header)

proj.4/nad/Makefile.am also list grid names that are hosted in the grid repo in the install-
data-local rule, so both repo are not currently independant.

So, I guess we could remove from proj.4/nad :
- null.lla
- the compilation rule of .lla files into CTable2 files (null.lla is the only remaining .lla file in 
proj.4 repo) (process-nad2bin Makefile target)
- the install-data-local rule
- ntf_r93.gsb, ntv1_can.dat, nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb

That way both repo would be entirely independant. Packagers would just have to drop the 
content of OSGeo/projgrids in the ${prefix}/share/proj directory.

I've given commit rights to the "proj-4-committers" team.

Even,

Thanks for setting this up! A few comments and ideas:


1.       Some structure in the repo would be nice. It might be as simple as having a folder called "grids" which contain all the grids and then README's and other relevant files in the root.

2.       We should come up with some rules to govern the repo with. The most important here is describing the requirements for getting grids accepted as part of the repository. A list of accepted licenses would be handy. Contact information or some other form of source of the grid is also needed I think.

3.       Can we convert the old CTable files to CTable2 format? The former are architecture dependent. Effectively fixes https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/44

4.       Are the current tests affected of your "removal-proposal"? Removing the null grid could have some consequences.

OSGeo/projgrids/null file (actually projgrids/null is a 'non clean' version of the result of the compilation of null.lla, with some garbage in a unused area of the header)

Wouldn't it have been better to import all previously releases too?

I did that for http://git.linuxminded.nl/?p=OSGeo/proj-datumgrid

See:

Preserving the .lla files in the repository is desirable because that is 
the source of the grid shift files.

Would the following make sense:
- Public domain
- X/MIT, BSD 2/3/4 clause
- CC0, CC-BY, CC-BY-SA

Or perhaps we could just require the license to be an OSI approved one ? The license of grid 
files, being data files, should have no consequence on the software stack itself, right ?

Agreed. The README could track the provenance & licensing of grids.

I don't see any remanining CTable file. As far as I can see, in projgrids, all files are CTable2 
except the .gsb files (NTV2) and ntv1_can.dat (NTV1). So the ticket can probably be closed.

I imagine that the tests woud probably require downloading a few grids.

I think it is a good start. Software licenses like MIT and BDS are probably not very suited for the purpose, so maybe we should discourage use of those.

I was of the impression that the alaska, conus and a few others were still in CTable format. Great if that is not the case!

Thatâs what I figured as well. It should be documented somewhere if it is required to download the grids before tests will pass.

Restructuring the repository shouldn't be a problem as long as the
resulting tarball keeps the grids in the root as they've always been.

Packaging proj has always involved unpacking the proj-datumgrid archive
into the nad/ directory to get a complete tree for building the project.
I don't think we should change that.

The license for grid shift files should be compatible with the Open
Source Definition (and thereby with the Debian Free Software Guidelines).

Historically the files included in proj-datumgrid where in the public
domain.

Yes, this is a good idea. It will be a bit of a chore to find the origin
of the existing grids, though.

proj 4.8.0 was the first release to default to ctable2, since 4.8.0 or

The null grid shift file is used by various projections defined in nad/IGNF.

While those projections can probably be updated to not require the null
file, there may be other projections created by users who rely on the
null grid.

I don't think the overhead of keeping the file warrant the possible
breakage it will cause for end users.

The proj-datumgrid archive should always be unpacked as part of setting
up the proj source.

What is the plan for how these bits are used?

It seems obvious to me that they should be released with version numbers
and enough of a packaging system that they can install into
${prefix}/share/proj/? or something, so that packaging systems can make
packages (one, separate?), for installation by use by end users.

But I suspect this bias to packaging may be less obvious to those who
are close to proj, especially if they themselves always run proj from
sources.

For now the proj build system is still expected to install the gridshift
files. This could possibly be separated in the future.

My real question is about the flow from repositories to releases of
tarballs to packaging system packages to bits in users' filesystems.  It
seems (but I could well be confused) that the points of proj-datumgrid
are

  - allow separate update cycle from proj proper
  - make size of proj itself smaller

Right now the pkgsrc proj package includes both proj and
proj-datumgrids.  That's perfectly workable, except that the version of
datumgrids isn't represented in the packaging system, which is perhaps
only cosmetic.

Is that how you think we should be doing things?   Or should the
datumgrids be a separate package, depending on proj, with its own
version?

I think so. For now at least. If the new grid repository grows substantially we might want to consider dividing it into several packages that the user can choose to install if they need some particular grids. This could be organised by e.g. region or type of grid.

  Or should the
datumgrids be a separate package, depending on proj, with its own
version?

I think that is how OSGeo4W does it. At least some grids are handled as separate packages.

The proj package in Debian also includes the content of the
proj-datumgrid archives.

proj needs to depend on proj-datumgrid assuming the projection files are
included in proj and the grid shift files they use in proj-datumgrid.

proj-datumgrid could become as more standalone package, but that require
changing proj to not assume the grids are available in the nad directory.

Please note that licensing issues is also a major reason for splitting
grids from code. There is probably no problems in combining material under
the MIT license (proj) and public domain or CC0 grid data. But what should
the license be for a compound package including MIT and CC-NC, CC-BY or
even, as recently seen, MIT and BSD 3-clause?
