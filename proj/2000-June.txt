Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Debian package for proj
Message-ID: <200006011647.MAA25618@mixing.qc.dfo.ca>

Hello,

I discovered this revival of proj about 5 minutes ago, following
links from a slashdot story from two days ago about
remotesensing.org.

I have been using proj for a few years to produce maps of various
projections and like it very much.  I'm very happy to see it
continued.

This is a note to inform you that I packaged proj for Debian
GNU/Linux last October.  See:

  http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/math/proj.html
  http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/doc/proj-ps-doc.html

I will shortly update the package to proj-4.4.1 (now that I know
of its existance).

The original docs were in PostScript format, and I see that they
are now in PDF.  Has the content changed?  I wonder if I need to
update the Debian proj-ps-doc package.

Thanks,

Peter a.k.a. <psg at debian.org>

Peter,

The PDF files are just converted from the PostScript ... no changes.  When
you have a .deb file, please let me know, and I will put it on the proj page.

Oh, sorry.  I couldn't tell from the ChangeLog entry.  No, that
shouldn't go in the source tar file.

Should I contact you or the whole list about any packaging
issues?  (e.g. proj-4.3.3 didn't build a dynamic library and I
think you do, and I may have questions).

Thanks,
Peter

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] problem with azimuth and distance
Message-ID: <393BCED6.F2755491@sainsel.es>

Here's a little problem I have with the PROJ4 library, and since I've
found no answer in the documentation nor in several sources, I'm trying
this list.

I have to determine latitude and longitude of a point given and initial
point latitude and longitude, and an azimuth and a distance from this
point.
I'm using the "geod" program to test the library and these are the
results:

csp1.pmm:~/csp98/swb/proj.4/src > geod +units=kmi +ellps=WGS84 <<EOF
> 80dN 10dE 90d 100
> EOF
79d51'53.25"N   19d27'54.76"E   -80d40'47.564"

In the example I want to determine the point at 90degrees azimuth and
100 nautic miles away from 80degrees North, 10degrees East.

The given azimuth equals to 90 degrees, then, why the resulting latitude
doesn't equal to 80 degrees North, like the starting point does?

Why the back azimuth doesn't equal to -90 degrees?


I'm sure this problem is not a bug of the PROJ4 library, and I want to
know where am I misusing the library...


Thanks a lot.

Answer: very simple, you have a great circle route and except for
N-S lines and E-W lines on the equator, none of these will follow
a parallel or meridian.  Think of the inverse problem.  Take two
points on a parallel and not on the equator.  The line will bow away
from the parallel, reaching a maximum N-S deviation from the parallel
midway between the points.  The forward and back azimuth will
be less than 90 degrees (northern hemisphere) and opposite in sign.
As the two points become more widely separated---still on the
same parallel, the |azimuth| decreases and eventuall will become
zero when the two points are separated by 180 degrees in longitude.

Its why you fly over Greenland getting from LA to Europe.

You are dealing with a geodesic line or great circle route not a
rhumb line or loxodrome represented by straight lines on a Mercator
projection.

OK, now it's clear to me.
Let's go farther:
Is there any way to follow a non great circle route using the proj.4
library? For example: I want to determine a point in the 80 degrees
North parallel 100 miles away from one given in the 80 degrees parallel
too.

If it is a "non great circle" route, what kind of route is it?

A rhumb line (loxodrome)?  If so, you can work in Mercator space
with a straight line and inverse project the intermediate points.

You question needs more qualifications.

It looks like you are trying to determine the inverse usage of
geod (lat1 lon1 lat2 lon2 -> azi1 azi2 dist) but because the inverse
option (-I) is not specified, you are doing the forward (lat1 lon1 azi
distance ->
lat2 lon2 azi2).

No comments until I see the correct inverse execution of:

geod -I +ellps=WGS84

and those input/output results.

I'm not saying geod is right or wrong but we got to make a
correct statement of out intents.  It may well have a problem because
specifying either polar point creates *all sorts* of problems.  ;-)

Message-ID: <3944CCD7.432557@Rhein-Main.de>

Hi,

i have a problem with the transverse mercator projection (Gauss-Kruger
Projection) only indirectly connected to proj4.

I am writing a program for data exchange with garmin gps receivers,
which give the position always in lat/lon wgs84, even if the receiver
itself displays position and waypoints in 'german grid' coordinates
(transverse mercator projection). I know that german grid here for
germany uses 3 degree wide meridian stripes (0d, 3d E, 6d E etc.), adds
a false easting of 500000 and prefixes the zone (0, 1, 2, 3, etc). 

But what on the southern hemisphere? Is there a constant false northing
of 10000 m added as with UTM? The receiver displays only "----", so that
i assume it is not defined for southern hemisphere. 

What with western longitudes? What with two-digit zones?

The receiver gives me the following readings:
lat    lon     easting/northing
29.27N 10.5W   5436500/5815100 (??)
29.27N 10.5E   4354200/3240000 (ok)
29.27N 18.83E  5579200/1675000 (??)
29.27N 18.83W  5923300/9718000 (??)
85.44N 18.83E  5009100/0035000 (??)
85.44N 18.83W  5923000/9718000 (??)

Are those values (??) only an internal overflow of the receiver?

Thank you in advance for any hints,

Andreas Lange

In some instances, I have heard that GK (Gauss_Kruger) only applied to
5 zones centered on 3E, 9E, 15E, ... ---European coverage.  Regarding
the German grid you mentioned, it seems strange to use 500,000m easting
when the zones are only 3 degrees wide, half the GK/UTM width.

Any reading where the easting exceed 500,000m is obviously seriously
in error and/or the wrong zone (CM) was specified.  Same if the easting
is negative.

Incidentally, are you capable of specifying the zone number to the Garmin?
Seems to me that would be required especially when you are on the seam
between zones and can use either.

As for southern latitudes and GK, I have never heard, but I would think
that 10,000,000m false northing would apply.  If it is labelled as a German
system, then southern latitudes don't apply so why bother with a false
northing.

A trouble with the Gauss-Kruger nomenclature is that it means two
different things:
1) a method of computing the transverse Mercator projection
2) a coordinate system identical to UTM except for zone numbering

>From your description of the "German" grid system, this is not
the same as GK.

This is not correct.
GK may be mathematically treated the same as UTM using for both the transverse mercator formulae.

   * UTM has a scale factor of 0.9996 and zone width of 6°
   * GK therefor has a scale factor of 1.0000 and implementations with 3° Zones (Germany, Austria,
     Easter-Germany, Kroatia, Russia...), but there exist als 6° Zones eg. also in Russia etc, (china has
     zones for 1.5°3°,6°width ...)
   * GK sometimes only is used for the projection type of transverse mercator, but with varying scale,
     zone width ... (e.g gauss-boaga in Italy (scals similar to utm, australia (s=0.99994, zone=2°)

the easting of 500'000m is established for UTM as well as for GK (to avoid negative numbers and to be
symmetrically beyond the central meridian.

for UTM, sometimes you find the zone number previously attached to eastings, but often, an own field for
the zone is found for this information.

the zone description for the eastings in GK varies from country to country and may not be included. the
inclusion gives problem due to the numerical Resolution of real numbers ...
the false northing also may vary from country to country ..
china: 0M northern hemisphere, 10000000 southern hemisphere
australia: 5000000m
and so on.
...
Many of these definitions may also be found at http://www.geocities.com/mapref/mapref.html

Hi Andreas,

maybe not an answer for your question, but of general
(European) interest: I convert with following calls:

Rechtswert Hochwert -> Lat Long

proj -I +proj=tmerc +a=6377397.1550000003 +es=0.0066743720\
  +lat_0=0.0000000000 +lon_0=$bezug +k=1.0000000000 +x_0=$ans +unfact=1.0000000000

where $bezug=meridian (degree, example: 9)
and   $ans= False Easting (example: 3500000)

Example:
In:  3560000 5700000
Out: 9d51'46.414"E   51d25'57.97"N

-------------------------------
Reverse transformation:
Lat Long -> Hochwert Rechtswert (y x)

proj +proj=tmerc +a=6377397.1550000003 +es=0.0066743720 +lat_0=0.0000000000\
     +lon_0=$bezug +k=1.0000000000 +x_0=$ans +unfact=1.0000000000

where $bezug=meridian (degree, example: 9)
and   $ans= False Easting (example: 3500000)

Example:

In:  9d51'46.414"E   51d25'57.97"N
Out: 3560000.01      5699999.99

Using your example I get (note: reverse order):
10.5W 29.27N
1585979.82      3402162.10

I am not shure if it is defined in southern hemisphere (but why
not, at least numerically)?

Best wishes
   Markus

Hi,

i verified all the values for the german system and for the
german/middle european range the values displayed on the receiver and
calculated from my program are identical (to ca. 10 m, what is
sufficient).

But my problem is that the GPS receiver gives readings for the other
range as noted below too. I don't think that these values are the result
of internal overflow from the device, as this would be very dangerous
(and garmin should be aware of such problems). 

The communication with the device is only via lat/lon in the wgs84 datum
(no zone data needed in lat/lon), all values must be converted on the
computer via software. And this gives the problem that if the device
displays a reading, i can not set this to an error in my software, as
the device and the uploaded data would be inconsistent in this case. If
the user accidently uploads or downloads data, the data for the
non-european range would be lost. 

Thanks for your comments so far, maybe i will contact garmin with the
questions. 

yours,

Andreas Lange

Again, the big problem has been the use of the term Gauss-Kruger in referring
to either a computational method and to a coordinate system.  Using GK to
refer to a coordinate system leads to confusion as shown in previous entrys
on this thread.

I suggest that except for UTM, which is well defined, other usages be detailed
as to scale factors,  central meridians, rather than rely on vague references
to GK coordinate systems.

A couple of elements caught my eye here and represent modifications
to PROJ.4 that are not part of the USGS distribution.  I am curious
as to what the parameter definitions are:

+unfact= ???

+k= ???

"k" is terminology for the scale factor anywhere while k_0 refers to
a scale factor at a specific location.  I don't think dropping the _0 wise
or meaningful.

As for "unfact" I have absolutely *no* idea what that is.

Also see imbedded note below.

I guess it is the scale factor as being 0.99996 for UTM and 1.0 for 
Gauss-Krueger.

This I cannot recall, but was told it once when wondering about it.
Sorry - no help today...
 
Morten Hulden <morten at ngb.se>, who updated the m.proj of GRASS 5,
explained it to me last year.

Sorry to be no more help (but proj4 and m.proj work well!)

+k rather than the preferred +k_0 may be an artifact that I left in the USGS
distribution.  I will have to check.

The "+unfact" option *is not* of my doing and comes from some non-USGS
distribution.  I'm mystified and curious of its purpose.

Since I see "m." I suppose it is a product of the GRASS people.

As some may be unaware, I authored the original PROJ.4 as distributed
by the USGS kai.er.usgs.gov site.

The file src/libes/get_proj.c (in GRASS) was developed by CERL
long time ago and added to the PROJ4 directory. It provides some
functions for GRASS to use the PROJ4 routines directly instead
of calling the "proj" in a script mode.
There are three functions provided:

int pj_get_kv(info, in_proj_keys, in_units_keys)
int pj_get_string(info, str)
int pj_zero_proj(info)

You can access the current file directly to look at it:
http://freegis.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/~checkout~/grass/src/libes/proj/get_proj.c


The software used in GRASS 5 is:
    -------------------- P R O J . 4 --------------------
                      @(#)README        4.11 95/09/24 GIE REL"
This is Release 4.3 of cartographic projection software.

The software used in GRASS 4.x was PROJ4.2.


> Since I see "m." I suppose it is a product of the GRASS people.
The m.proj is a GRASS module to control the PROJ4 software.
The GRASS 5 version always outputs the command line calling the
"proj" tool. There I got the string I posted yesterday to convert
Gauss-Krueger to Lat/Long and reverse.

We are grateful to your for your distribution of PROJ4.

Please note that the unchanged PROJ4 was included in GRASS.
>From the GRASS sources it reads:
src/libes/proj/README 

This is PROJ4.3.3 from kai.er.usgs.edu

Added in GRASS 5 beta4d (16. Sept. 1999)

Morten, could you please teach me/us about "unfact" parameter?
I shall store it somewhere in GRASS sources.

Dear Markus

+unfact= is a GRASS variable 'unit factor' that gets passed to proj's info
structure as info->meters. It is also present in GRASS' internal
location description file PROJ_UNIT. 

+unfact is the conversion factor from meters to other units
(e.g. feet). The value of +unfact is 1 if the location unit is meters. 

get_proj.c is the routine that parses the pseudo-command line passed from
GRASS and converts +unfact to a real PROJ parameter.

+unfact is not the only GRASS specific parameter that will not be sent to
PROJ as such; e.g. all spheroid names are parsed and converted to their
'a' and 'e2' values, which are then sent to PROJ routines. Spheroid names
are never sent to PROJ. In fact, PROJ has a slightly different list of
names for the spheroids, and does not know of some spheroids used in
GRASS (e.g. 'sphere').


hope this explains it
why things were done as they were I have no idea
but they work

best regards
Morten Hulden

What is interesting here is that PROJ.4 has a units conversion facility.

A second comment is the ellipsoid naming.  PROJ has an easily maintainable
table for ellipsoids.  Since there was freedom for the other mods, why
wasn't updating the table done?  However, for some applications, I agree
with the basic a=, e2=, etc. method.  Also, units conversion can also be
achieved by merely controlling the units of a= (and b= and any other
parameter like x_0, y_0).

As a final note, rather than changing PROJ.4 it seems easier to change the
application software that uses the PROJ.4 library and leave the program
unchanged and irrelevant to the project.  Program *proj* is more of an
example of how to use the system and a useful filter but not a totally
universal tool.  The library is the important *universal* tool.

The confusing issue here is that there are now two "proj" programs.

Dear Mr. Evenden,

just some comments on GRASS and PROJ.4:

GRASS has (for historical reasons?) its own ellipsoid table. This table
is a plain ascii file, so that it can be changed without the need for
recompiling. The values for a and e2 are read from the GRASS database
file, as the information for the ellipsoid is associated with the GRASS
location. I think the ellipsoid table inside GRASS was updated by Morten
Hulden when he updated the projection support in GRASS. So there was no
need to update the ellipsoids in PROJ.4.

GRASS uses PROJ.4 code unchanged. Only two functions are added
(pj_get_kv for reading parameters from the GRASS location database and
set the values with pj_init and pj_do_proj to do the actual projection
of a point). pj_do_proj is only a wrapper to use pj_fwd or pj_inv. So
the entry points of the library are used unchanged.  
 
> The confusing issue here is that there are now two "proj" programs.

Not with GRASS. What Markus Neteler described is the interactive version
m.proj of GRASS, which is only a user interface within GRASS.
