All,

The documentation for the proj.4 project has always been in flux, mostly due to proj.4's shared history as a friendly fork. The current situation is a difficult challenge for users looking for information. There's stuff in PDFs, stuff in two different wikis, and stuff in man pages. All of it can be a little bit different, and users are left to figure out what is the top of the heap on their own. 

I know that adding *yet another* website by itself to this mix might not really solve the problem, but I think part of the issue has been that it was difficult to maintain a single, streamlined documentation set. To that end, at the Paris Code Sprint [1], I implemented a documentation system based on Sphinx [2], which has stabilized the management of documentation for many other projects in the open source geo space like OpenLayers, MapServer, and GeoTools. 

I then adapted work of Even Rouault and Thomas Bonfort from the MapServer project and applied it in proj.4's situation to close the loop on the documentation system. What this means is every pull request that updates documentation will cause the website to be regenerated and refreshed (you can even edit on the GitHub website and make a PR if you want). Combined with the Sphinx organization, it will be easier for the proj.4 project to maintain and deliver coherent documentation.

It is my hope that this approach will allow documentation contributions to easily make it to the canonical website, allow the documentation to be organized more thoroughly, and it will allow multiple documentation output types (HTML, PDF, man, etc) to be easily generated from a central documentation set. There is still plenty of work to do, including organizing things, porting over and merging up docs from the various locations, and deciding on possible output types.

PS, are the original Latex files for the various PS/PDF files available somewhere? It would be really nice to port all of that stuff into a single organized documentation set without having to copy/paste out of PDFs.

Great work Howard.

If anyone else wonders where the source of the docs live:

Subject: [Proj] Geodetic datum for the "Netherlands East Indies Southern
	Zone"?
Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD493E0189D3@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello all,

I have come across an Indonesian map. In the legend, it says 
that the ellipsoid is Bessel and the projection is Lambert Conic
Orthomorphic. The projection parameters agree with the "Netherlands
East Indies Southern Zone", covering Java and the Lesser Sunda Islands,
as described by Clifford Mugnier in his column on Indonesia (page 1160,
left column).
http://www.asprs.org/a/resources/grids/10-2009-indonesia.pdf

The projection is not listed in the EPSG database, as far as I can see.

What I am not sure of, is the geodetic datum. The graticule of the 
map showed longitudes from Jakarta, but that doesn't help much, since
many local geodetic datums in Indonesia use Jakarta as the prime meridian.

In the EPSG database, the only geodetic datums that fit - using the
Bessel ellipsoid and covering Java - are Batavia and Batavia (Jakarta),
EPSG codes 6211 and 6813. And I noticed that the "Netherlands East
Indies Equatorial Zone", also mentioned by Mugnier, is listed in 
EPSG (code 3001), and uses the Batavia datum. 

Can I conclude that the Netherlands East Indies Southern Zone also
uses the Batavia datum, or could it use some other datum that is
not listed by EPSG?

Your assumption is likely as good as any regarding ancient datums in Indonesia.  Note that the Dutch established these âdatumsâ primarily in support of their rubber plantations.  Way back when, â¦ , astro datums were just that; individual astronomical observations used as starting points for small, separated triangulation chains in support of local plantations.  The same rationale applies to old French Colonies in the âdark continentâ (Africa).

Calling these old systems âdatumsâ is largely a charitable term.

The Grid systems were primarily established in WWII for indirect artillery (and naval) fire support, and were loosely connected to terrestrial systems based on ersatz datums established as cartographic imaginations referred to by academics as âCartographic License.â

That's a really good question.  I've been on this list for a long time
and haven't seen any.

proj4 uses EPSG codes.   I think a question to answer first is how EPSG
codes represent epoch.

For example (US centric :-), NAD 83 has many incarnations, but arguably
the standard one is "NAD83(2011)":
  http://epsg.io/6318

However this doesn't talk about epoch at all.  Arguably coordinates in
EPSG 6318 are epoch 2010.0, following:
  http://geodesy.noaa.gov/CORS/coords.shtml

But, it's not clear to me how to represent a different epoch, or to talk
about velocities in EPSG or proj4 at all.

So, I suspect you have to transform to the standard epoch in some frame,
and then to another frame, and then to the epoch you want.

Enhancement request #154 [1] is somewhat related, which is to add
support for ITRF geocent EPSG codes (e.g. [2]), but nothing about
datum support.

An alternative is NRCan's TRX tool [3], which uses reference frame and
datum inputs for 3D transformations.

I think the following doesn't work ...

> So, I suspect you have to transform to the standard epoch in some frame,
> and then to another frame, and then to the epoch you want.

The reason is that it is the conversion between frames that is time dependent.

There are three different things happening here.

One is about different realisations of a reference frame (eg NAD83(2011) is a realisation of a datum based on the 2011 National Adjustment), or WGS84 is actually a series of reference frames such as WGS84(G730), WGS84(G1762).  Each of these is realised at a date (epoch) but is used to represent coordinates at multiple epochs.  These are just different reference frames.

The second is about time dependent transformations between reference frames, which depend on the epoch of the coordinate, ie the epoch at which the conversion applies.  So for example the conversion between most geodetic datums (such as the ITRF datums such as ITRF2005, ITRF2008) involves a 14 parameter transformation  consisting of the 7 parameters of a Bursa Wolf transformation and 7 rates of change of parameters (eg scale difference at reference epoch and rate of change of scale difference per year).  This is not handled in the conventional GIS coordinate system defintions and conversion software AFAIK.  With the increasing use of global coordinate systems such as ITRF2008 (because of satellite based positioning) this is something that we will need to address.

The third is about time dependent transformations to account for ground deformation.  This is not so much about converting between reference frames, but about accounting for that fact that objects that we consider as fixed to the ground, and intuitively expect to have a constant coordinate, are actually moving in a global sense due to plate tectonics and other forms of ground deformation.  So if we want to use coordinates in the conventional GIS sense to identify or calculate relationships between objects then we need to have the coordinates at a common epoch - it doesn't make sense to compare the position of one object in 2000 with the position of another object in 2016.

The HTDP software represents the deformation of the North American continent and can be used to convert positions between  different epochs (or perhaps more accurately to transform the position of a "ground fixed" object from its coordinate at one epoch to its coordinate to another.

Similarly in New Zealand we have a deformation model that transforms between epochs, though the implementation is slightly different in that it is part of the definition of the NZGD2000 datum.  So to convert a coordinate from NZGD2000 to, for example WGS84(G1762), requires applying a time dependent transformation based on the deformation model to convert to the underlying datum (ITRF96) and then a 14 parameter Bursa Wolf transformation to convert to WGS84(G1762).  This approach is designed to ensure that coordinates of "ground fixed" marks remain substantially constant,  despite tectonic deformation moving the points in a global sense.

The North American and NZ approaches are slightly different (in that in NZ the deformation model is explicitly part of the definition of the datum), but the effect is very similar.

>From the point of view of GIS, PROJ, and EPSG I think that the long term solution must be to include time dependent coordinates systems and epoch transformation within the software stack, but that is a far reaching change.  I guess it must start in the definition and conversion software.

In the meantime it is possible to use workarounds such as defining custom coordinate systems for specific epochs,  as in the http://proj4.org/htpd.html approach.

Cheers
Chris

Message-ID: <9B336821-7D38-4BD4-BCD7-F571D2613891@carbomap.com>

Hello list,

Iâm trying to convert some ECEF data to UTM zone 33N (WGS84) in a C++ application. My code is working but the results are not correct as the data are skewed along an axis.

Iâve adapted the example code available on the wiki about pj_transform but wonder if there is anything special to consider in term of coordinates order for the ECEF input as the X,Y,Z might not be obvious? and I believe itâs the reason for the skewed results...

Any pointer welcome.
Best regards.

Yes, I was trying to take that into account, and to let someone use proj
for part of the work, but do velocities of each frame separately.

What I meant as an example

  Given coordinates in NAD83(2011) epoch 2016.0, transform them
  (somehow, correctly) to NAD83(2011) epoch 2010.0.   This gets you
  coordinates that proj just calls NAD83(2011).

  Then use proj to transform to ITRF2008, which I think implies epoch
  2005.0 as the standard epoech.

  Then transform ITRF2008 epoch 2005.0 to ITRF2008 epoch 2016.0

This is probably not right because it blurs the frame motion vs ground
motion issues, and I think the conclusion is that this sort of geodetic
pickyness is beyond what proj is currently trying to or succeeding at
doing.

For information, the EPSG team is aware of this issue. Roger Lott, from
IOGP, briefed us on this topic in the previous OGC meeting three months
ago. The issue is deeper than just creating new EPSG codes as it may
require a revision of the ISO 19111 conceptual model. There is
discussion in OGC right now about creating a new Standard Working Group
(SWG) for this purpose. But I do not know how long it would take to
complete the work - except that it would not be this year.

The last bit of this is the bit that doesn't work, as there is no transformation of ITRF2008 between 2005 and 2016.   The ITRF2008 coordinate of a point may be different at 2005 to what it is at 2016 (because the point has moved within the ITRF2008 reference frame in the mean time), but this is not part of ITRF2008 or its definition.

However the transformation between different global reference frames, such as ITRF2008 and ITRF2000, is time dependent.   That is to say that the transformation between an ITRF2000 coordinate and the equivalent ITRF2008 coordinate for coordinates observed in 2005 is different to that for coordinates observed in 2015.

Most national datums are aligned more or less with the tectonic plate on which the nation is mainly located, and so the transformation between the national datum and a global datum such as ITRF2008 is similarly time dependent.   This is nothing to do with deformation, it is that the coordinate axes of the reference frames are moving relative to each other.

In the past this may have been geodetic pickyness but I'm not sure that is the case now, for two reasons.  One is that there is a trend towards using coordinates with higher precision.  The other is that as GNSS (global navigation satellite systems such as GPS) become more and more accessible much more data is acquired in global reference frames, so conversion between national and global reference frames is a more common requirement.  Possibly a third reason is that the length of time we have had accurate coordinates in GIS databases is increasing and the difference between reference frames over the time span of the data is becoming more significant.

While PROJ itself was originally formulated for map projections (a simple mathematical conversion) it has nonetheless evolved into the de factor coordinate conversion toolkit for the open source GIS software stack, and certainly does handle reference frame conversions to a degree.  So it doesn't make sense to have some other software that is used when your data gets a bit too precise (or too geodetic?) for it to handle.

On the other hand coordinate conversion does become much more ambiguous when converting  coordinates between reference frames rather than between projections - the parameters are not absolutely defined but generally realized by observations, and jurisdictions may adopt different parameters for the relationships between datums.

Thank you all for your replies.  Very much appreciated.  we are under
considerable pressure to enhance our Proj4 based apps to include support for
epoch. We will see if we can coordinate something via OGP.

Gerald (or maybe others)?

As part of the website and documentation remodel for proj.4, it would be really nice if we could collect the content of the various PDFs into a living document.

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/OF90-284.pdf
ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj.4.3.pdf
ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/proj/proj.4.3.I2.pdf

Would it be possible to get the source latex files for these documents, and would you support us including them as part of a larger documentation effort for http://proj4.org?

Thanks much,

Howard

No, time is not at all handled anyway by the library .. Proj4 is only a 
very simple library to do the most common projection transformations and 
usual datum shifts. If you have time dependent matters you have to firts 
transform the time to a datum shift and then feed it into the library.

Hello,

I haven't heard anything about Gerald since many years and also Frank 
been very silent lately. I suppose Frank might have an idea if anybody 
here? I think Gerald is (if anywhere) more active on the "libproj" side? 
.. if Proj4 was written sometime 1970 first time .. you can count years 
your self etc..

If nothing else helps it might be a good time to write them again using 
the originals as basis?! (And also compile them all together into a 
single manual) .. ??!! Most likely no copyright problems exsist if 
original writers are mentioned etc. etc..

It is also possible that any original manual files are lost for ever?! 
.. lucky we have the source code still! :)

Regards: Janne.

Two notes:

The first, and probably the second, document are publications of the US government and thus in the public
domain.

It isn't difficult to extract the text from the .pdf file, but putting all the LaTeX formatting back would be a lot
of work -- though it would not be difficult to "parallelize" this, with a little community organization.

Postscript files for the PROJ.4.3.*.pdf files can be found here:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/from_kai/

I've been trying to find the code that was used to create the plots in the files, but haven't had any luck yet. It should be possible to extract the plots from the ps-file though.

I was looking into this with Kristian Evers this morning - and it actually
shows to be quite easy to extract Gerald's original map projection
illustrations.

The figures are embedded by dvips, directly from original files (probably
generated using his MAPGEN cartographic system,
https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70015083) directly into the PostScript
files, where they are neatly delineated by "BeginDocument"/"EndDocument"
pairs:

As an example, the Mercator projection illustration starts approximately
2500 lines into the OF90-284.ps file downloaded from
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/from_kai/ with the quite readable line:

%%BeginDocument: plotter -d eps cylind/merc.ov

Hence, a meaningful file name can be generated from the last element of the
BeginDocument line.

Writing a plain PostScript header and appending everything from
BeginDocument to EndDocument is just a matter of a few lines of AWK, and
converting to tightly cropped PDF-format can be done using the ps2pdf
function from Ghostscript, in combination with Heiko Oberdiek's pdfcrop
thing.

Everything is shrink-wrapped into 35 lines of AWK, included below (Howard:
would it be worth submitting a pull request, adding this to the proj
documentation effort?)

That would be fantastic.

My primary reason for trying to get at the original files are indeed the figures. It should be straightforward to port the text and equation stuff over, but the figures are a very valuable part of the document. 

Search engine-friendly, linkable documentation is the ultimate goal, and the original documents are a big missing piece of that. Thanks for any contributions you can make.

Howard
