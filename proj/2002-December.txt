Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Donald Elliptic Projection for AT&T V&H Coordinates?
Message-ID: <200212012016.MAA15879@bilby.ucsd.edu>


Being interested in puzzles, I worked through the code (more or less)
and rewrote it in a language I prefer. I append the result. I've added
some explanatory comments, although some mysteries remain--the original
Donald notes would be needed to clear these up. Apparently John Snyder
had a copy--anyone know where it might now be?

I agree with a comment that, for something like this, the procdure
is what it is, correct or not--it is purely conventional. So here
are some results, with what comparison I could make.

    lat         long                 V         H       Comparison

37 42 14.69  82 39 15.27	  6363.235  2250.700   (one end)
41 02 55.53 112	03 39.35	  7519.455  7107.410   (other end)
39 04 41.68  77 00 04.58	  5587.002  1600.999   5587 1601 (1)

38 53 50.30  77 01 36.47	  5621.999  1582.002   5622 1582 (1)
30 16 28.82  97 44 25.19	  9003.475  3996.792   9004 3995 (2)
 
(1) - htlt.com V&H converter (examples on their Web page)
(2) - Peter H. Dana's coordinate systems Web page example

  note that it appears to be conventional to give V and H as integers

It is possible that Dana did not have an "official" version--or, perhaps
his is correct, and the htlt one is not, but matches the code here
(they may have a common source). If there is an official answer, it
would be with Telcordia, which is part of what used to be Bell Labs.

Not a bad recreation for a holiday weekend.

c
c    V&H is a system of coordinates (V and H) for describing
c    locations of rate centers in the United States.  The
c    projection, devised by J. K. Donald, is an elliptical,
c    or "doubly equidistant" projection, scaled down by a factor
c    of 0.003 to balance errors.
c    
c    The foci of the projection, from which distances are
c    measured accurately (except for the scale correction),
c    are at 37d 42m 14.69s N, 82d 39m 15.27s W (in Floyd Co.,
c    Ky.) and 41d 02m 55.53s N, 112d 03m 39.35 W (in Webster
c    Co., Utah).  They are just 0.4 radians apart.
c    
c    Here is the transformation from latitude and longitude to V&H:
c    First project the earth from its ellipsoidal surface
c    to a sphere.  This alters the latitude.
c    Also subtract 52 degrees from the longitude.
c 
c    Compute the arc distances of the given point to the reference
c    points, and transform them to the coordinate
c    system in which the line through the reference points is the
c    X-axis and the origin is the eastern reference point.
c    Reduce by three-tenths of a percent, rotate by 76.597497

c  The above are the constants for the latitude transformation.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Alternate Angular Units
Message-ID: <3DEAA718.3010501@pobox.com>

Folks,

I am hard at work upgrading OGR and libgeotiff to the EPSG 6.2.2
database, and as part of the effort I am reviewing all sorts of
outstanding issues related to the EPSG database, or PROJ.4's epsg
mapping.

One issue that arises is that some EPSG coordinate systems, such as
those based on the "Nord Sahara 1959 (Paris)" datum use gradians as
the angular units.  Note that 200 gradians = 180 degrees.  The question
that arises is whether it makes sense for PROJ.4 to know anything about
alternate angular units for input/output of lat/long values.

If this is incorporated it would allow a more accurate representation of
a few exotic EPSG coordinate systems.   If done, I assume we would add
something like +to_degree=... listing a factor to apply to angular input
values to translate them to degrees before processing, and to apply
(inversely) after processing to return them to the original units.  I
would also suggest this value be processed by pj_transform() but not by
pj_fwd() and pj_inv().

The pj_fwd() and pj_inv() entry points already operate in radians (not
degrees), so they could be assumed to be operating at a level at which
this sort of issue is ignored, much like the suggestion of the prime
meridian applying to pj_transform(), but not pj_fwd() and pj_inv().

Any thoughts on the issue?

Best regards,

Before preceeding further, I am curious about what code referred to in your first
sentence and where was if from?  Was this code in the Java scripts?

There does appear to be problems in that your execution does not seem to
do very well with the htlt? example numbers.  I didn't find the exact equivalent
of what you used on their web pages.  Could you give a path to the web
page you used below.

Thank you.

Mr. Evenden,

I was not upset, just pointing out historical facts on projection math.
The French could not "correct their maps.  :-)" because the maps were
already printed and the "Bosch" were occupying their country.  The work
that the C&GS tried to interceed with was with the estranged French
Topographic Corps residing in London.

The French only "corrected" their math in 1948 after WWII.  It took the
U.S. Army Map Service to (mathematically and figuratively) "bop" them in
between the eyes with a ball peen hammer before they changed to a fully
conformal Lambert conic.  By that time, the rest of Europe was on the
European Datum, UTM Grid.  Some prior French colonies (in North Africa)
still cling to that old artifact of the French Army Truncated Cubic Lambert
Conic.

Screwy or not, it's what's implemented is what counts for the locals.

It sounds like I unknowingly upset someone.  I appogize.

Secondly, I did not suggest "improvements" only a method of skinning a cat.

Thirdly, I *always* verify code provided these is a method or data to
campare
with.  Most programmers do (I hope).  At the moment I am unaware of the
whole math picture of the Donald projection and/or any data to compare
results with.  So nothing is happening on my watch.

Speaking of errors, when I was first working on projection software I too
had
problems resolving the differences between my software and existing data.
It
turned out to be US engineering foot versus the International foot.

In your example, the French were obviously in error and should have
been gracious enough to correct their maps.  :-)

I couldn't agree more with your message and it was inexcusably sloppy of the
USAMS to not verify their projection with the existing charts/numbers of the
French.

One of the biggest problems I've had in coding projections is to find numbers
to compare the execution of my code.  Once you leave the area of the 20 odd
projections supplied by the USGS GCTP, making comparisons is very, very
difficult..

Secondly, how close should the comparison be?  For conformal projections
and any involved in plane coordinate system usage, projections should agree
to 1 mm.  Some of my codings are more accurate than alternate
source code simply because I have found it trivial to extend the precision
of some series to the ~15 digit limits of type double.

It was the U.S. Coast & Geodetic Survey that had the WWI faux pas; AMS was
not in existence then.

In regard to accuracy, the published specification for NAD83
transformations is "better than 0.1 mm."  (re: Jim Stem, NGS) For the
NAD27, generally 0.01 ft is more than adequate; the original tables would
only yield about 0.05 ft computational accuracy.  (That's because they used
a "short-cut" for latitude - geocentric). (re: John Snyder)

Most foreign stuff published BEFORE WWII was considered adequate to 0.1
meters (computational) accuracy by the British.  The French were not much
different.

I agree that it's particularly knotty to scrounge "test points," and it is
of critical importance nowadays with two different direction conventions
for rotation angles being used in 7-parameter datum shift transformations.
The Americans & Australians do it one way, the Europeans do it the other
way, naturally.

I couldn't agree more with your message and it was inexcusably sloppy of
the
USAMS to not verify their projection with the existing charts/numbers of
the
French.

One of the biggest problems I've had in coding projections is to find
numbers
to compare the execution of my code.  Once you leave the area of the 20 odd
projections supplied by the USGS GCTP, making comparisons is very, very
difficult..

Secondly, how close should the comparison be?  For conformal projections
and any involved in plane coordinate system usage, projections should agree
to 1 mm.  Some of my codings are more accurate than alternate
source code simply because I have found it trivial to extend the precision
of some series to the ~15 digit limits of type double.

Message-ID: <200212022029.MAA01403@bilby.ucsd.edu>


	My source for the Donald algorithm was indeed the java script
VHTransform.java that is part of the Openmap software; this also included
most of the descriptions (though not the material from John Snyder's book).
Download this from http://openmap.bbn.com/  It also includes the code for
the inverse transform.

My sources for the comparison values were

	http://www.htlt.com/products/vandh/vhnllconverter.htm
and
        http://www.colorado.edu/geography/gcraft/notes/coordsys/coordsys_f.html

(I couldn't include these in the earlier message for technical
reasons--sorry).

I'd note that the telecoms people seem to have difficulty getting agreement
amongst themselves; see
	http://www.atis.org/pub/clc/niif/nrri/100302confcall.doc
(another find by Google)

and these comments from Telecordia:
	(http://www.trainfo.com/products_services/tra/vhpage.html)
   Since their introduction, V&H Coordinates have become widely used throughout
   the telecommunications industry, not only for determining distances between
   points, but also for designating the locations of switches, transmission
   facilities, and other items of telephone plant.  However, ever since the V&H
   Coordinate system was developed, the underlying mathematical principles have
   been shrouded in mystery.  Little information has been made available
   to the general public and many of the lines of code in programs that are used
   to perform the conversions represent the result of numerous complex
   calculations that have never been publicly identified.

and they go on to say that their document will describe
                  
      C.the steps required to convert "Basic" V&H Coordinates to "Final" V&H
                  Coordinates

which suggests an additional layer, perhaps not available in the algorithm
from Openmap.

	Discrepancies at the 0.002 level in V&H correspond to about a meter:
large for a grid, but perhaps not so bad for something used largely to set
rates. The way in which the code is set up (direction cosines and lots of
precomputed constants) make me suspect that this is the original 1957
implementation, probably for an electromechanical desk calculator--so
who knows how much rounding really went on?

Being interested in puzzles, I worked through the code (more or less)
and rewrote it in a language I prefer. I append the result. I've added
some explanatory comments, although some mysteries remain--the original
Donald notes would be needed to clear these up. Apparently John Snyder
had a copy--anyone know where it might now be?

I agree with a comment that, for something like this, the procdure
is what it is, correct or not--it is purely conventional. So here
are some results, with what comparison I could make.

    lat         long                 V         H       Comparison

37 42 14.69  82 39 15.27	  6363.235  2250.700   (one end)
41 02 55.53 112	03 39.35	  7519.455  7107.410   (other end)
39 04 41.68  77 00 04.58	  5587.002  1600.999   5587 1601 (1)

38 53 50.30  77 01 36.47	  5621.999  1582.002   5622 1582 (1)
30 16 28.82  97 44 25.19	  9003.475  3996.792   9004 3995 (2)
 
(1) - htlt.com V&H converter (examples on their Web page)
(2) - Peter H. Dana's coordinate systems Web page example

  note that it appears to be conventional to give V and H as integers

It is possible that Dana did not have an "official" version--or, perhaps
his is correct, and the htlt one is not, but matches the code here
(they may have a common source). If there is an official answer, it
would be with Telcordia, which is part of what used to be Bell Labs.

Not a bad recreation for a holiday weekend.

c
c    V&H is a system of coordinates (V and H) for describing
c    locations of rate centers in the United States.  The
c    projection, devised by J. K. Donald, is an elliptical,
c    or "doubly equidistant" projection, scaled down by a factor
c    of 0.003 to balance errors.
c    
c    The foci of the projection, from which distances are
c    measured accurately (except for the scale correction),
c    are at 37d 42m 14.69s N, 82d 39m 15.27s W (in Floyd Co.,
c    Ky.) and 41d 02m 55.53s N, 112d 03m 39.35 W (in Webster
c    Co., Utah).  They are just 0.4 radians apart.
c    
c    Here is the transformation from latitude and longitude to V&H:
c    First project the earth from its ellipsoidal surface
c    to a sphere.  This alters the latitude.
c    Also subtract 52 degrees from the longitude.
c 
c    Compute the arc distances of the given point to the reference
c    points, and transform them to the coordinate
c    system in which the line through the reference points is the
c    X-axis and the origin is the eastern reference point.
c    Reduce by three-tenths of a percent, rotate by 76.597497

c
c  The above are the constants for the latitude transformation.
c  John Snyder's description of this (p 235 of his _Flattening the
c  Earth_, drawing on the original Donald manuscript) states
c  "The Clarke 1866 ellipsoid was first transformed
c  onto an authalic sphere, but the latitude adjustment was altered

Before preceeding further, I am curious about what code referred to in your first
sentence and where was if from?  Was this code in the Java scripts?

There does appear to be problems in that your execution does not seem to
do very well with the htlt? example numbers.  I didn't find the exact equivalent
of what you used on their web pages.  Could you give a path to the web
page you used below.

Thank you.

Mr. Evenden,

I was not upset, just pointing out historical facts on projection math.
The French could not "correct their maps.  :-)" because the maps were
already printed and the "Bosch" were occupying their country.  The work
that the C&GS tried to interceed with was with the estranged French
Topographic Corps residing in London.

The French only "corrected" their math in 1948 after WWII.  It took the
U.S. Army Map Service to (mathematically and figuratively) "bop" them in
between the eyes with a ball peen hammer before they changed to a fully
conformal Lambert conic.  By that time, the rest of Europe was on the
European Datum, UTM Grid.  Some prior French colonies (in North Africa)
still cling to that old artifact of the French Army Truncated Cubic Lambert
Conic.

Screwy or not, it's what's implemented is what counts for the locals.

It sounds like I unknowingly upset someone.  I appogize.

Secondly, I did not suggest "improvements" only a method of skinning a cat.

Thirdly, I *always* verify code provided these is a method or data to
campare
with.  Most programmers do (I hope).  At the moment I am unaware of the
whole math picture of the Donald projection and/or any data to compare
results with.  So nothing is happening on my watch.

Speaking of errors, when I was first working on projection software I too
had
problems resolving the differences between my software and existing data.
It
turned out to be US engineering foot versus the International foot.

In your example, the French were obviously in error and should have
been gracious enough to correct their maps.  :-)

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Build problems in CygWin
Message-ID: <4EDD36F80DC8634390D3CE5AEAB9D3FD016F88@terraadmin.TERRANET>

Hi,

I am attempting to build proj4 in CygWin and am running into an error
that I need help with. I have included the results of my build attempt
along with the resulting makefile.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Matt

I have tried a forward projection with a stereographic projection with no
luck.
Are there any suggestions?
Here is what I entered in the command prompt.
proj +proj=stere +lat_ts=30d00N +lat_0=90 +lon_0=90d00W +k_0=1 +x_0=200
+y_0=200
Here is the error I'm getting...
projection initialization failure
cause: major axis or radius = 0 or not given
program abnormally terminated
Here is what I found on the remotesensing.org website for a stereographic
projection.
 +proj=stere +lat_ts=Latitude at natural origin 

              +lat_0=90

              +lon_0=Longitude at natural origin

	      +k_0=Scale factor at natural origin (normally 1.0)

              +x_0=False Easting

              +y_0=False Northing


I'm trying to do a forward projection with a polar stereographic projection.
Any advise would be welcomed.
Thank you

Bryan,

You also need an ellipse definition.  This requirement is "assumed" in much
of the documentation.

Try:
proj +proj=stere +lat_ts=30d00N +lat_0=90 +lon_0=90d00W +k_0=1 +x_0=200 +y_0=200 +ellps=WGS84

By the way, those are pretty odd x_0 and y_0 values.  Is the value
easting and northing really 200 meters?

Best regards,

Frank,

Thanks for your help.  Everything seems to work now.  As for the false
easting and northing numbers...  I was just using these as a test to input.

Let me see if I'm straight on this.  False easting and northing is nothing
more than an adjustment on the x,y plain?  So, if I'm going to make
adjustments to fit screen x,y I will use this method?

Sorry for all of the questions, I'm new to GIS/Projection type stuff.  I
have a steep learning curve.  I'm trying to draw a Polar Stereographic map
of the US by reading a map file that contains lat/lon coastal data. I'm
running input lat/lon data from the file through Proj4 and trying to get
screen x,y to draw my coastal lines etc...  I have done this with a mercator
projection and it was fairly simple.  I hope for the same by using Proj4.

Thanks for your input!
Bryan

Please limit your posts to the minimum required to 
see the error.  In this case there was no need to add
anything more then output of the make command

Try adding AC_PREREQ(2.13) as the first 'real line' in configure.in

i.e.
dnl Process this file with autoconf to produce a configure script.
# Require at least automake 2.13
AC_PREREQ(2.13)

This is to insure that the minimal autoconf version
capable of libtool compilation with Cygwin is used

Bryan,

I assume you could leave the x_0 and y_0 as zero.  For you the stereographic
coordiantes don't have any intrinsic significance, right?   You just convert
to stereographic and then stretch the result to your view window?  The
false easting and northing are used by convention in some predefined
coordinate systems primarily to keep the coordinates positive for easier
human use.

No sweat.  To be truthful, I come at projections from a GIS perspective where
I have little understanding of the math. I am just reasonably good at plugging
parameters from various metadata formats into the projection functions.  I put
numbers in, I get numbers out, they match expectations and I am happy.  Note
that I didn't write PROJ.4, I am just the maintainer.

Hi Norman,

Sorry about being lengthy on the first post.  I tried your suggestion,
but still have the same result.  I did some research and found a posting
on a build problem on an unrelated library where they had the same
error.  The solution was to delete the ltconfig script.  I tried that,
but no luck.  It didn't really make sense as the ltconfig script seems
to customize to the O/S.

Any other ideas?

Thanks,

Matt

Did you rebuild the configure script by running autoconf ???

FWIW - I usually rebuild all of the maintainer files
with something like the following

#! /bin/bash
export PATH=/usr/autotool/stable/bin:${PATH}
aclocal
automake -a
autoconf
./configure
make clean
make

If this doesn't work I would check your Cygwin installation
as this just worked for me on a fresh CVS checkout

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] prime meridians
Message-ID: <3DF4BDFB.2070502@pobox.com>

Folks,

I have introduced a form of prime meridian support to PROJ.4.  The
+pm=<prime_meridian> option can be used to set a prime meridian.  The
argument can be a longitude (relative to Greenwich) or the name of
a well known prime meridian.  These can be listed with the -lm flag:

warmerda at gdal[317]% cs2cs -lm
    greenwich 0dE
       lisbon 9d07'54.862"W
        paris 2d20'14.025"E
       bogota 74d04'51.3"E
       madrid 3d41'16.48"W
         rome 12d27'8.4"E
         bern 7d26'22.5"E
      jakarta 106d48'27.79"E
        ferro 17d40'W
     brussels 4d22'4.71"E
    stockholm 18d3'29.8"E
       athens 23d42'58.815"E
         oslo 10d43'22.5"E

The prime meridians are applied within pj_transform() so that if the
input or output coordinate system is proj=latlong with a prime meridian
set the longitude will be offset accordingly.  The prime meridian does
not effect pj_fwd() and pj_inv() all. The u and v results from these
functions will always be relative to Greenwich.  So (by association)
the prime meridian will have no effect on the proj program, it is
only utilized in cs2cs (based on pj_transform()).

When I generate the new epsg init database I will be including non
greenwich meridians where appropriate.

I also looked at implementing an angular units option but decided
against it in the end.  Currently PROJ.4 input/output angles are all
radians, and it is up to the client programs (including proj and cs2cs)
to convert to degrees or other units if they wish.  Therefore I don't
feel it appropriate for the proj.4 core to "known" about coordinate
system angular units.  I have implemented support for angular units in
my OGRCoordinateTransformation wrapper around PROJ.4.

Let me know if there are any questions.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <3DF4F9AE.B266D39@verizon.net>

First, and I think a very important point, PROJ does not know of the
existance of a "Prime Meridian."  Input longitude is always relative to
a user define origin and may be offset with the built in "lon_0" option.
I do not see where specifying a prime meridian is anything more than
redefining lon_0.

Secondly, the  u-v results of the library entries are relative to the user's
definition of the geographic origin.  Similarly, the users defines the units
of the cartesian data by his definition of the geodetic radii.  There is
conversion of x-y for cases where the geodetic units are in meters and
the user wants x-y in some other metric.

As for radian input, that applies to the library calls that emulate other
math function calls that employ radian input (ie. sin, cos, tan, ...).  Program
proj allows for conversion of variants of DMS to and form radians as
well as binary radian I/O.

I don't object to the simple filter function of adjusting longitude but I
do strongly object to the statement that any part of the PROJ.4 system
has any knowledge of a "Prime Meridian."  It does seem strange
to me that someone would use the Paris meridian and then crank
geographic coodinates thru the system that were *not* in the Paris
meridian system.  If everything is relative to the Paris meridian one
would use proj in a maner identical to, say, US usage.  That is, the
French live in a different world than the English, but proj functions
without change in both worlds (except for lack of French language
manuals ;-) ).

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] prime meridians
Message-ID: <OFF2C6B883.F24DD102-ON86256C8A.0072D383@lsu.edu>


>From a purely cartographic standpoint, the concept of a Prime Meridian is
immaterial.  However, with the addition of a PROJ4 facility to accommodate
Datum transformations, the necessity becomes obvious when using both a
"local" or "national" Datum and a global Datum such as WGS84.

Cliff Mugnier
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY
------------------------------------------
First, and I think a very important point, PROJ does not know of the
existance of a "Prime Meridian."  Input longitude is always relative to
a user define origin and may be offset with the built in "lon_0" option.
I do not see where specifying a prime meridian is anything more than
redefining lon_0.

Secondly, the  u-v results of the library entries are relative to the
user's
definition of the geographic origin.  Similarly, the users defines the
units
of the cartesian data by his definition of the geodetic radii.  There is
conversion of x-y for cases where the geodetic units are in meters and
the user wants x-y in some other metric.

As for radian input, that applies to the library calls that emulate other
math function calls that employ radian input (ie. sin, cos, tan, ...).
Program
proj allows for conversion of variants of DMS to and form radians as
well as binary radian I/O.

I don't object to the simple filter function of adjusting longitude but I
do strongly object to the statement that any part of the PROJ.4 system
has any knowledge of a "Prime Meridian."  It does seem strange
to me that someone would use the Paris meridian and then crank
geographic coodinates thru the system that were *not* in the Paris
meridian system.  If everything is relative to the Paris meridian one
would use proj in a maner identical to, say, US usage.  That is, the
French live in a different world than the English, but proj functions
without change in both worlds (except for lack of French language
manuals ;-) ).

Gerald,

As Cliff points out, the primary reason for tacking on a distinct
concept of prime meridian is so that coordinate system to coordinate
system conversions can be done within the API.  This is outside the original
scope but a part of what I am trying to accomplish with pj_transform() ...
which is intended to have the ability to translate between any two
coordinate systems (with lots of limitations of course).

Now it is  practical to translate coordinates between coordinate systems with
different prime meridians.  You can dispute whether coordinate system
to coordinate system translation belongs in PROJ.4, but at this point
it is part of my goals for the library, and the least I can do is try
and do it well.

This is correct of course, but when I talk about capabilities I am mainly
looking at the API level which is what is used in the various environments
like GRASS, MapServer, OGDI and OGR.  The commandline programs are useful but
not the way that most interaction with "PROJ.4" occurs.

Message-ID: <3DF5452E.BAC6664E@verizon.net>

I apologize for part of the problem as it is of my own making.

PROJ.4 was a cartographic projection system.  My error was to include
some datum shifting material that was useful to my local users at
the time of distribution.  The material was *very* parochial and not properly
designed for global applications partly because *very* little information about the
general world condition in this field was readily available in my local,
backwoods environment.  This unfortunate inclusion NGS US datum
conversion code probably started the concept that PROJ was also a datum handler.

What you people are doing involves general handling of geographic data
in all kinds of environments and where cartographic projection is only
part of the activity.  It would make sense to me if you call your
package something more meaningful than PROJ, something that would
more truly indicate the scope of your operations.  For example, you
might be using Prostgres to manage your data storage and retrieval
but you would not call the overall system Postgres.

My problem is that I still think of PROJ in its original form, a cartographic
projection function and thus react to functions that are outside of my
concepts of what the system should perform.

Message-ID: <3DF56B70.1070607@pobox.com>

Folks,

Does anyone know anything about the 'mpoly' (Modified Polyconic) projection?
As pointed out by a PROJ.4 user, there doesn't seem to be any actual
implementation code for this projection in PJ_mpoly.c.   Can anyone think
of any reason I shouldn't just remove all reference to this projection?

Here is PJ_mpoly.c:
#ifndef lint
static const char SCCSID[]="@(#)PJ_mpoly.c	4.1	94/05/22	GIE	REL";
#endif
#define PROJ_PARMS__ \
	double	rho_0;
#define PJ_LIB__
#include	<projects.h>
PROJ_HEAD(mpoly, "Modified Polyconic")
	"\n\tPolyconic, Sph\n\tlat_1= and lat_2= lotsa";
FORWARD(s_forward); /* spheroid */
	return (xy);
}
INVERSE(s_inverse); /* ellipsoid & spheroid */
	return (lp);
}
FREEUP; if (P) pj_dalloc(P); }
ENTRY0(mpoly)
	P->fwd = s_forward;
	P->inv = s_inverse;
	P->es = 0;
ENDENTRY(P)

Several projections have acquired that name, and indeed is has been used as a 
category name. But by far the most important was Charles Lallemand's, which 
the International Map Committee adopted in 1909 for the International Map of 
the World series. Its use continued until 1962. Snyder gives formulae in

Map Projections -- A Working Manual (USGS Professional Paper 1395) 1987, pp. 
131-137

Message-ID: <60D284762AA8B840B0DF22953C5014A802049EF9@fsnkak18.littlerock.aetc.ds.af.mil>

I have a quick question I hope to get some advise on.


I am trying to retrace the outline of the US that is on a weather satellite
image.  The image is in the form of a polar stereographic projection (so
I've been told).

I have created a routine that reads map coastal data for the US (lat/lon
values) and run the values through proj.4 and get output x,y coordinates.  I
have successfully drawn a map of the US, but the drawn map doesn't match the
image map close enough.  It seems that the northern portion of the map
(Maine to Washington state) needs to be narrower, and the southern portion
needs to be wider.  This discrepancy is only by a few longitude degrees, but
still not as close as I would like.

Ok, here are my questions...

1.  Could the problem be in the wrong ellps that I use?  (I have tried
several, with not much change)?

2.  Is there any way I can adjust the input values to modify the map the way
I want it?

I am very new to cartography type stuff, and still in the learning process,
so any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

This is what I'm using for input values to get the US map.

 +proj=stere +lat_ts=90 +lat_0=110 +lon_0=100d40E 
        +k=1 +ellps=sphere

Another point, the +lat_0=110 seems to be very odd, but this is the value
that I had to input to get the map to somewhat line up.


Thank you

Bryan Ray

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Oblique Mercator, and Swiss Oblique Cylindrical
Message-ID: <3DF7A4EF.2090902@pobox.com>

Folks,

I am working on getting Swiss Oblique Cylindrical working properly in a
higher level tool build on PROJ.4, and am running into a number of problems.

1) The omerc projection in PROJ.4 does not let me select an azimuth of 90
    degrees.  My understanding is that Swiss Oblique Cylindrical is essentially
    Oblique Mercator with an azimuth of 90 but that is clearly considered a
    degenerate case in the PJ_omerc code (and it reports an error).  Is this
    just due to the mathematical formulation of the omerc code?

2) I have tried setting the azimuth quite close to 90 (ie. 89.99) and
    PROJ.4 seems to work but the results do not match what I am expecting.
    Off by a few thousand meters in my test case.  My test point was derived
    by using FME to reproject some swiss data into lat/long on the same datum.
    Does anyone have a sample point I could use in swiss oblique cylindrical?
    That is, the location in lat/long and soc?

3) Just to ensure I had a known starting point, I tried reprojecting the
    example point from the EPSG note on oblique mercator.  This is described
    in section 1.4.7 of their "Guidance Note # 7".  The section is available at:

Frank,

Try:

Longitude = 8º 47' 55.1112" E
X = Northing = 400000.000

Y = Easting = 641836.510
Convergence Angle = +0º 24' 35.0"
Scale Factor = 1.0001671

However, the Swiss Office of Topography DOES have a web site, and when I
checked a few years ago, they had TWO papers on their Datum and their
Rossenmund projection in English in ".pdf" format.  I don't have the files
with me at the moment, but you should be able to get them easily.

I published my column on the Grids and Datums of the Swiss Confederation in
"Photogrammetric Engineering and Remote Sensing" in August, 2001, pp.
807-808.  You can download it from www.ASPRS.org/resources.html

Note that the Swiss, Hotine, and Laborde (Madagascar) implementations are
each different from each other.

Folks,

I am working on getting Swiss Oblique Cylindrical working properly in a
higher level tool build on PROJ.4, and am running into a number of
problems.

1) The omerc projection in PROJ.4 does not let me select an azimuth of 90
    degrees.  My understanding is that Swiss Oblique Cylindrical is
essentially
    Oblique Mercator with an azimuth of 90 but that is clearly considered a
    degenerate case in the PJ_omerc code (and it reports an error).  Is
this
    just due to the mathematical formulation of the omerc code?

2) I have tried setting the azimuth quite close to 90 (ie. 89.99) and
    PROJ.4 seems to work but the results do not match what I am expecting.
    Off by a few thousand meters in my test case.  My test point was
derived
    by using FME to reproject some swiss data into lat/long on the same
datum.
    Does anyone have a sample point I could use in swiss oblique
cylindrical?
    That is, the location in lat/long and soc?

3) Just to ensure I had a known starting point, I tried reprojecting the
    example point from the EPSG note on oblique mercator.  This is
described
    in section 1.4.7 of their "Guidance Note # 7".  The section is
available at:

     http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/epsg_om.html

    However, I could get my results to agree.  Basically I tried:

      proj +proj=omerc +lat_0=4 +lonc=115 +alpha=53.31582047222222
+k=0.99984
         +x_0=590476.87 +y_0=442857.65 +ellps=evrstSS +units=m < rso_eg.dat

    where rso_eg.dat contains:

      115d48'19.8196"E 5d23'14.1129"N
      # 679245.73 596562.78 expected

    But instead of getting the expected results I get:
      679743.48       596274.24

Dan,

Because your wish is my command, I have incorporated geocentric coordinate
support in a form accessable to the end user.  The fake projection
"geocent" may now be used with the pj_transform() function and the cs2cs
user program to define a coordinate system in geocentric coordinates.
The linear units are also applied to this geocentric coordinate system, but
prime meridians, x_0, y_0 and other non-ellipsoid parameters are ignored.

eg.

% ./cs2cs +proj=latlong +ellps=WGS84 +to +proj=geocent +ellps=WGS84
0 0
6378137.00      0.00 0.000
0 90
0.00    0.00 6356752.314
0 90 1000
0.00    0.00 6357752.314

Geocentric coordinates should not be used with the proj program as it
only operates in 2D.  It is only for "real" projections.

I would encourage you to check out the latest PROJ.4 CVS source and test
the new facility as a "punishment" for requesting the feature.

PS. I will release a new version of PROJ.4 as soon as I am happy with my
updated translation of the EPSG 6.2.2 database to a PROJ.4 initialization
file.

Best regards,

Frank,

Now if you use a 3x3 orthogonal rotation to a tanget or secant plane to the
ellipsoid and drop the third component, Z; you will have the ellipsoidal
implementation of the Polyhedric or Polyeder.  There are topo sheets still
published on this ancient projection.  (Sometimes called the Muffling).

Hi Frank, everyone.

I'm having an installation problem similar to the one reported in
http://www.remotesensing.org/lists/proj_archive/msg00429.html . This problem
had a suggested solution in
http://www.remotesensing.org/lists/proj_archive/msg00430.html, which I
unfortunately could not understand...

There is some kind of libtool version problem. The libtool which is in my
system has version ltmain.sh (GNU libtool) 1.4 (1.920 2001/04/24 23:26:18)
but, as I run 'make' I get the following error:
/bin/sh ../libtool --mode=compile
gcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I. -I. -I. -DPROJ_LIB=\"/usr/local/share/proj\"    -g -
O2 -c PJ_aeqd.c
libtool: ltconfig version `' does not match ltmain.sh version `1.3.4'
Fatal configuration error.  See the libtool docs for more information.

Has anyone seen this before? How can I solve this?

Bye and thanks, Luís Mota

I think you just need to run libtoolize  % info libtoolize

or  just
% cd $PROJ_SRC
% libtoolize --force

Please look at the minor bugs listed here:

  http://bugs.debian.org/proj

and see if they can be fixed in the next release.

They might have been already, as I don't track CVS for proj.

Thanks,

Hi Norman.

Your suggestion did in fact help. I used the second option you suggested and
everything worked fine.

Bye and thaks a lot.

Dear sir.
Ive visited the Proy4 site and I found it so interesting.
Im Engineer Surveyor and MSc Geodesist from Chile, Ive participated
writing a Technical Manual for Secretary of Publics Works, focusing
Roads Enginiering Projects. On that manual we have introduced as
standard the TM modified projection.  That modified is dued to high
terrain to conserve  horizontal distances in the projection used to
construct, avoiding deformations between the project and the final work.
The rules we have imposed is mainly in to the Scale Factor in the
central meridian, calculated by the function of mean radious "R" and the
elipsoidal heigh "h": Ko=(R+h)/R
The surface of the resultant cilinder "pass" over the earth surfece
(terrain) where the road is placed.
By the another habd we are starting to use as official geodetic
reference Sirgas, coincident with ITRF2000, as well the rest of
Southamerican countries.
Is in your project consider that kind of projection and geodetic
references?.
