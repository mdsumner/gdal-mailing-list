Subject: [Proj] specific projection on the surface of WGS84 ellipsoid
Message-ID: <450121351755796@web11e.yandex.ru>

Greetings!

Could you please help me with the following task. It is very specific, so any suggestion is welcome.
I need to divide the surface of the WGS84 ellipsoid into several sectors by lines which connect the North and South Magnetic Poles and which are situated on flat planes, passing through North-South magnetic axis at equal angles between adjacent planes. (The same in other words: we take some Earth ellipsoid (say WGS84), locate the North and South Magnetic Poles on it's surface (they are not antipodal), connect the poles by straight line, divide the space around the line into several equiangular sectors. Where do the planes between the sectors cross the surface of our ellipsoid?)

Sincerely,
Aleksander

Hello, after a long pause, I come back to this thread of using proj with 
the so-called rotated lat/lon coordinates, used mainly in Numerical 
Weather Prediction models.
	I think I have found a cleaner solution, i.e. using proj for going from 
the geographic space to the "projected" space (which in this case is 
still a spherical polar coordinate system) and invproj for the opposite 
task and not the other way round. For this purpose it is just necessary 
to set the parameters in a different way in order to invert the 
transformation, which is not difficult (assuming that previously o_lon_p 
and o_lat_p were interpreted as the coordinates of north pole of 
rotation and lon_0=180):

o_lat_p remains the same (= lat of rotated N pole)
o_lon_p=180+lon_0=360=0
lon_0=180+o_lon_p (= 180 + lon of rotated N pole)

	So in the case previously indicated by Hermann the correct 
transformation using invproj would be:

invproj -f "%.6f" -m 57.2957795130823 \
  +proj=ob_tran +o_proj=latlon \
  +o_lon_p=0 +o_lat_p=39.25 +lon_0=18

which gives the expected results. Of course the same parameters apply to 
forward proj.

	If anybody is going to try this feature, please report any result.

	Best regards, Davide

Subject: [Proj]  How does scaling function?
Message-ID: <B470B3CC1E1F374CB34E6AF6B386834703FA75@HERMES.landcare.ad.landcareresearch.co.nz>

Greetings,
   We have recently discovered a new scaling problem within the HEALPix projection separate from the previous scaling error.  We have identified the problem which can be identified in the code below.

FORWARD(e_healpix_forward); /* ellipsoidal */
    double beta = auth_lat(lp.phi, P->e, 0);
    lp.phi = beta;
    return healpix_sphere(lp, P);

Here the HEALPix projection is being called on an ellipsoidal model of the earth.  The following is necessary:

Convert from Ellipsoidal to Sphere
Convert from Sphere to Plane

We need proj.4 to scale based on the sphere model not the ellipsoidal model.  How does scaling work (I have seen in proj.c that there are pre and post scaling functions).  Is it possible to set a configuration option in P so that proj.4 scales according to a Sphere and not an Ellipsoidal model?

Thanks

Subject: [Proj] Slightly off-topic: The phantom island that is real
Message-ID: <8CF98013DB55EBC-7A4-EF21@webmail-d196.sysops.aol.com>

The crew of a research ship claims to have undiscovered a large island in the South Pacific’s Coral Sea near New Caledonia, called Sandy Island. The news feeds have picked up on this and it’s making its way around the geeksphere with great rapidity. Here is an example article:
     http://phys.org/news/2012-11-aussie-scientists-un-discover-pacific-island.html

However, it is quite clear from satellite imagery and multiple data sources that the “island” in fact exists, though possibly it is a barely submerged sandbar. Yet the crew claims depths there are around 1,400 meters.

Obviously the ship was not where they say it was. The question is, how did the crew of this research vessel convince themselves they were sailing in the same area? I don’t think a datum mismatch can account for this, given the size of the sandbar. 

I have started a thread here:

Enjoy!

Joaquim: Thank you for the explanation. But I think all you have done is confirm that the region is probably a large sand bar, sometimes submerged or partially submerged. There seems to be two reasons data is so sparse there: frequent cloud cover hindering remote sensing, and very shallow water that makes soundings by ship impossible.

Here is a representative sample of MODIS data that I culled from USGS’s Global Visualization Viewer:
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MODIS-MCD43A4-02-2004.png

The particular MODIS data set is MCD43A4 (MODIS/Terra+Aqua Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance 16-Day L3 Global 500m SIN Grid). If you cycle through the months and years, you can clearly see that MODIS usually sees something there but sometimes does not. That means (to me) that sometimes the sand bar is submerged too far for the satellite to detect it but usually is shallow enough to yield a signal. None of the data are consistent with deep water.

    Although we never phrased it out in those mails, it's quite obvious    that what appears to an island in the SRTM+ is nothing but an    interpolation artifact introduced by a constrain imposed the    coastline itself. Notice how close the coastline and the 1 m meter    contour lines are. Furthermore the maximum height in the SRTM+ data    is 1m meter, which is obviously very suspicious. I'll add it also    that the 'Walter' that appears in one of those mails is Walter Smith    from the Smith & Sandwell bathymetry.
    
    HOWEVER, that does not rule out the possibility that the island    exists. Only says that there is no reliable data to constrain the    grid construction at that location. The 1400 m difference also    puzzled me a bit and moved by your mail I searched also the MODIS    data for Sea Surface Temperature ... and the mystery continues MODIS    does not seam to find water over there. See the image that I posted    in GMT mailing list.

I don’t            follow your assertion. The e-mail you cite states the island DOES                  appear in GTOPO30 and SRM30+. I see the same thing. When I look at the raw values in                  SRTM30 Plus, the entire area of the                    island consists of sea-level DEM values. Plus, NASA Blue Marble satellite                        imagery clearly shows shallow water over the                        entire 30_km x 6_km area that is                                called “Sandy Island” on                                  innumerable maps.
      
      Whether or not there is an “island”          there (as opposed to a barely submerged            sandbar) is perhaps open to                debate or depends on the tides.                    But the crew of the                        research vessel is claiming 1,400_m soundings,                                    which just                                        does not coincide with that area                                        at all.

Hello,

well it might also be a hiding place for a military vessel .. 
for example a large aircratft carrier ..
that would explain the reason why it time
to time disappears and comes back?

at least the "sand island" top view is very
much like an aircraft carrier? ;)

At 30_km x 6_km that would be one mighty aircraft carrier! Also, it shows up  
on 19th century maps, same shape, which would makes it a doubly impressive  
aircraft carrier.

Hello,

well it might also be a hiding place for a military vessel .. 
for example a large aircratft carrier ..
that would explain the reason why it time
to time disappears and comes back?

at least the "sand island" top view is very
much like an aircraft carrier? ;)

Hehe,

the phantom military vessel theory is not totally excluded..

if there is a place that is 1400 m deep water when
a research vessel visited it and old maps show
whatever and so do new.. and nobody can 100%
confirm anything.. so I would put a military vessel
of what ever size as one of the possibilities..
until better researched

Subject: [Proj] Is the "INDIAN (Indian 1956)" datum in the EPSG database?
Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD49392A3AF0@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello!
I've been asked if we support the "INDIAN (Indian 1956)" geodetic datum, and I can't
find it in the EPSG database.

The site [1] lists an "Indian" datum using the "Everest (India 1956)" ellipsoid, with area of use:
India and Nepal, and geocentric translations dX=295 m, dY=736 m, dZ=257 m to WGS84.
The article [2] tests this datum shift in India, and gives the impression that this is an
important datum in India.

The ellipsoid size and shape is the same as EPSG's "Everest 1830 (1962 Definition)" ellipsoid.
But in the EPSG database, this ellipsoid is used only in EPSG's "Kalianpur 1962" datum, area
of use: "Pakistan - onshore". Could the "Indian 1956" datum nevertheless be the same as
"Kalianpur 1962"? If not, is it the same as some other EPSG datum?

I noticed that the geocentric translations I cited are the same as in EPSG tfm 1156,
"Kalianpur 1975 to WGS 84 (1)". So maybe "INDIAN (Indian 1956)" is the same as
EPSG's "Kalianpur 1975".  But the ellipsoid that EPSG gives for Kalianpur 1975 is
"Everest 1830 (1975 Definition)", whose equatorial radius is 2.092 meters shorter.
The Remarks for tfm 1156 seems like an unofficial deprecation:

        "Care! DMA ellipsoid is inconsistent with EPSG ellipsoid - transformation parameter
         values may not be appropriate. Also source CRS may not apply to Nepal.
         Derived at 7 stations."

Anyway, I've heard that much geodetic information is classified by India,
but I am grateful for any hints.

Aha! It must be Captain Nemo's submarine Nautilus that surfaces
now and then. Jules Verne wrote about it in 1870, so it could
appear on 19th century maps! 

Okay, so it is supposed to be only 70 meters long, but what's
a few of orders of magnitude among friends?

Hehe,

the phantom military vessel theory is not totally excluded..

if there is a place that is 1400 m deep water when
a research vessel visited it and old maps show
whatever and so do new.. and nobody can 100%
confirm anything.. so I would put a military vessel
of what ever size as one of the possibilities..
until better researched

Yes,

now you have the right spirit in this topic:

though Nemo must be excluded since it was a fictitious figure
by Jules Verne..

generally speaking as long as something is not excluded it
must be included ;)
