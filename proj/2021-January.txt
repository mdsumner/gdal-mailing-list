I have some RPMs built against Proj 7.2.0. Do I need to rebuild them
against 7.2.1?

I didn't get to deal with and test the beta/rc versions, but I am happy
to report that I've updated the pkgsrc-wip entry for proj to 7.2.1 and
it not only builds but passes all its tests on NetBSD 9 amd64.

Subject: [PROJ] ESRI deprecated CRS
Message-ID: <CADRrdKtjfZToKKhSd6Cem0FHsQV7SFKQYegV09qoP2ZcerR4ow@mail.gmail.com>

I found a CRS in proj.db that seems to be deprecated, but I do not
understand why exactly (or what does deprecated mean)

NAD_1983_StatePlane_Virginia_South_FIPS_4502_Feet

(I guess it happens to other CRSs as well. Let's focus in this one)

in proj.db (table projected_crs) appears as ESRI:102747, deprecated
I ended up in this repo, where I think we get the ESRI CRSs
https://github.com/Esri/projection-engine-db-doc/blob/master/json/pe_list_projcs.json
(json is easier to read than csv)

That CRS appears twice in the file, with exactly the same name. The only
differences I can find are:
 - wkid
 - authority / version
 - deprecated

    }
  },


I do not know what does it mean. Has ESRI deprecated its own CRS, but
includes the EPSG one (btw, which one?)... with exactly the same info and
name?
The consequence is that it appears (only once) as deprecated in proj.db. Is
that intended?

Making this query
SELECT auth_name, code, name, deprecated FROM projected_crs WHERE name LIKE
"%Virginia%South%"
I realized that the deprecated ones are duplicated in a similar way in ESRI
file. The non deprecated ones (from CORS96) are not "duplicated" in the
ESRI file. Is there any reason behind that?

A more general question: What does mean that a CRS is deprecated?

Thanks

Hi,

While I am? not a CRS/proj wiz kid, a deprecated CRS? is outdated.? 
Changes can be in the parameters or simple things like the name. 
Deprecated does not mean it's not good but likely not currently used by 
the state because of changes to the parameter. To my knowledge

102747 in proj.4 is

+proj=lcc +lat_1=36.76666666666667 +lat_2=37.96666666666667 +lat_0=36.33333333333334 +lon_0=-78.5 +x_0=3499999.999999999 +y_0=1000000 +datum=NAD83 +units=us-ft +no_defs

and 2284 in proj.4 is

+proj=lcc +lat_1=37.96666666666667 +lat_2=36.76666666666667 +lat_0=36.33333333333334 +lon_0=-78.5 +x_0=3500000.0001016 +y_0=999999.9998983998 +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=0,0,0,0,0,0,0 +units=us-ft +no_defs

According to https://epsg.io/102747 and https://epsg.io/2284.

As you can see, there are small differences like the reversal of the 
standard parallel 1 and 2. Others will give you more information.

Javier,

I'm not sure. I suspect their 10xxxxx records might have pre-dated the EPSG 
ones (or they didn't adopt them right away), and then they decided to use the 
EPSG ones.

Yes, proj.db reflects the information from the Esri database.

No idea. That's a question for Esri.

> A more general question: What does mean that a CRS is deprecated?

Probably depends on the producer. The meaning for EPSG is given in paragraph 
"5.6.1 The Deprecated field" of Guidance Note 7-1. See
https://epsg.org/guidance-notes.html

Regarding Nicolas's remark:
> As you can see, there are small differences like the reversal of the

For LCC, you can switch std_parallel_1 and _2 indifferently.

The website doesn?t seem to update when new changes are pushed
to the 7.2 branch. As far as I can tell the CI doc jobs run as they should
but somehow the website is still stuck in with the 7.2.0 version of the docs. 

Any ideas?

The website is updated by the linux_gcc Travis-CI job, but it failed on 
testappprojinfo:
https://travis-ci.com/github/OSGeo/PROJ/jobs/469121095

The reason was that proj_version() in CMakeLists.txt had not been updated to 
7.2.1

I've just pushed a fix for this. Hopefully that will fix the website 
generation.

Related to that, on master, if we want to completely go away from Travis-CI, 
the only piece not migrated yet is the website refresh. I had created a ticket 
for that: https://github.com/OSGeo/PROJ/issues/2461
The current .github/workflows/doc_build.yml builds the docs, creates an 
artifact but doesn't update the gh-pages branch.

Even,

Thanks! I was sure that the doc updates had been migrated to Github Actions
so I didn't even look at the Travis job. Good catch. I think that it would be
great to migrate the website push from Travis to Github Actions. Is the only
thing missing figuring out the deploy key?

Thanks, for the clarification. That?s is what I thought.  I was always wondering if this was just down to some writing convention or if this switch really mattered. I?am really not a geodesic expert...

Subject: [PROJ] Strange (non) 3D transformation - EPSG:4322 to EPSG:4222
Message-ID: <CADRrdKsZvY6F1NYJb+=toH5i3E-cR33MOTp-C6zxyDYXSyUxgQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am testing a conversion from WGS72 (EPSG:4322) to Cape (EPSG:4222), and I
expect to get a noticeable difference in Z, due to the significant datum
shift.
However I do not get it.

To avoid any misunderstanding, I am converting everything to 3D with this
command:
as3d () { projinfo EPSG:$1 --single-line -o WKT2:2019 --3d -q }

Using projinfo with "--spatial-test intersects" returns a reasonable
transformation (I think), that composes two Helmert transformations.
What am I doing wrong?

Pivoting manually via EPSG:4326 gives reasonable values in Z

Run with PROJ 7.2.1 compiled in Ubuntu 18.04, without any grid file.

Thanks

Message-ID: <CADRrdKuaxE3sarjB_wS3cVkqELjj76=DrXDwEn8Rvahpz_pLJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Can I make a Compound CRS combining two different authorities? Let's say,
ESRI:102121 (NAD_1983_Michigan_GeoRef_Feet_US) and EPSG:6360 (NAVD88 height
(ftUS))
If it makes sense, is there any notation to combine them? something like
"ESRI:102121+EPSG:6360" ?

Thanks

Message-ID: <CADRrdKtOLHDY0JEo-+cGW9Y0bCFjjt7Rya7842VjqYpeb9zp7A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Somehow I ended up checking the Slovakian geoid in https://cdn.proj.org/
and it says this:

sk_gku_Slovakia_ETRS89h_to_Baltic1957.tif: Slovakia, Geodetick? a
kartografick? ?stav Bratislava (GKU), ETRS89 (EPSG:4937) to ETRS89 + Baltic
1957 height (EPSG:8360)

(something similar for sk_gku_Slovakia_ETRS89h_to_EVRF2007.tif)

It says the transformation is from EPSG:4937 (3D crs) to EPSG:8360
(Compound crs)
However in other cases the target crs is just a vertical crs, not a
compound one. I was expecting in this case EPSG:8357

Is that intentional? How is the right way to tag them? Maybe both?

Thank you.

Hi,

Traditionally, EPSG has been linking 3D CRSs to 1D physical heights, however this transformation method (e.g. transformation code 9665) is strictly speaking not reversable, since the horizontal coordinates are lost. A year ago, I discussed with EPSG the idea of linking 3D CRSs to a compound CRS of their corresponding 2D CRS + the 1D physical height instead, which would be better as it is reversable. This would require a new EPSG method, so it wasn?t easy to introduce. I am wondering if EPSG did introduce that method now (transformation code 1088?).

Regards, Jochem

Hey PROJ folks,

I'm working with a couple others debugging an issue with the Rust bindings
for PROJ. Specifically, the tests are failing on the latest MacBook Air,
which runs on Apple M1 which is ARM-based. I'm curious if anyone else in
the community has run into issues with PROJ running on ARM or Apple
Silicon. Thanks!

GitHub Issue: https://github.com/georust/proj/issues/52

I investigated this more and it turned out to be a bug in bindgen, a Rust
utility that facilitates Rust and C interop. You can read more about the
bug here:

Thanks all!
