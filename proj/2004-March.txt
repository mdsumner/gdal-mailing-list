Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Using cs2cs to convert latlong nad27 to custom tmerc
Message-ID: <002501c40200$b408d5f0$d701a8c0@matt>

Hi,

I am trying to do a conversion with cs2cs from latlong (nad27) to a
custom tranverse mercator. The response is some *s for the x,y values.
Does this have something to do with the nadgrid files and datum shifts?

I am using the pre-built windows version proj446_win32_bin.zip which I
believe includes the nadshifts for nad27.

Thanks,

Matt


This is the attempt that fails:

C:\new_proj\bin>cs2cs +proj=longlat +datum=NAD27 +to +proj=tmerc
+datum=NAD83 +x_0=500000 +y_0=0 +lat_0=0 +lon_0=-115 +k=0.9992 -v # ----

This is one that works ( but latlong,wgs84 to tmerc ):

Hi Sam,

Awesome!  That did the trick for me.   I dropped the two files you
attached into my nad directory and reran the test(with PROJ_LIB pointing
to the right spot).

Thanks,

Matt

proj446_win32_bin.zip doesn't include the shift files.  I had a very
difficult time getting them running in windows myself.  In fact I did so
many things I can't even fully remember what I did to finally get them
to work.  I believe you need the ASCII .lla grid files (no idea where I
got
them) in the NAD folder when you build.  Since you want to use the bins
though, that may be a problem.  I've attached the conus and Ntv1_can.dat
files that work for me.  You also need to setup the PROJ_LIB path as
stated in README.DOS in the from_kai directory of the ftp site.  It
would be great to get the files added to the proj446_win32_bin.zip.  It
would have saved me many long hours of anguish.

Message-ID: <FA8ACD82-70EA-11D8-8A27-000393DC1748@ic.ac.uk>

Hi,

  I wondered if anybody can help me identify a projection. I need to 
digitize some range maps from a book on the birds of the USSR: all the 
maps share the same basemap but the book itself contains no projection 
details. The image is on the web: 
http://www.bio.ic.ac.uk/research/iowens/orme/FlintMap.png.

The only latitude or longitude mark on the map is the arctic circle: as 
far as I can make out this is an arc from a circle, although there is a 
hint that at the edges of the map the arc may turn down away from the 
circle. I've tried identifying 10 degree lines of latitude and 
longitude from locations around the map edge and that suggests to me 
that the map is projected on something like a equidistant conic or 
albers projection. What I've got so far:

* the central meridian is around 105 E.
* the longitude lines look like they converge on the centre of the 
circle, although if I try and draw them in from geography, they don't 
converge very well.
* a degree of longitude is about 0.4 degrees of arc on the projected 
map.
* the latitude lines don't seem to be equally spaced - in particular, 
the 80-70 N gap is wider than the other three latitudinal spacings.

I can't get it to fit - has anyone got any suggestions for projections 
or projection parameters? It doesn't help that I suspect the map is 
rather inaccurately drawn.

Thanks,
David

Looking at it with dividers and a ruler it looks to be a conic and 
spacing
of parallels eliminates equidistant.  The parallels are at 10 degree 
intervals.
but the longitude appears to be at 10 degree intervals as well but I 
find
odd discrepancies when comparing locations of the inland seas and
arctic islands with an old Goode atlas.  Soviet disinformation, maybe?? 
;-)
 From what can be seen from the spacing of the parallels I would guess
conformal so try Lambert Conformal Conic (lcc) as a first guess with
tangential latitude near the center.  Scaling will be trial and error.

PS: a lot of Soviet map projections are covered by Maling in "A Review
of Some Russian Map Projection" in addition to the aforementioned Snyder
reference.

Hi,

Thanks to everyone for hints and help so far. Just to be clear, I have 
added the 10 degree lat/long lines - the only lat/long mark on the 
original is the dotted line of the arctic circle. The latitudes are 
centred on the best fit circle I could find to the the arctic circle 
curve and the longitudes radiate from there - they aren't perfect but 
they are close enough to suggest that the map is some form of conic.

Cheers,
David

Hello everyone! This my first post to this list. My name is Maciek.

I'm using Grass 5.03.

I need to make a mapset in a projection called Roussilhe Oblique
Stereographic (alias
Quasi-Stereographic).

The system name is "Uklad 1965" (eng. "System 1965"). It's an old, the most
popular and widely used system in Poland. The ellipsoid is Krassovsky, datum
Pulkovo 1942 modified for Poland.

Issue - there is no projection called like Roussilhe or Quasi-Stereographic
in Grass.

At http://crs.ifag.de they suggest to use Stereographic. Is it right? If so,
then WHAT SHOULD I INPUT FOR "LATITUDE OF TRUE SCALE". No such info is
provided in any literature regarding the "System 1965".

Any suggestions welcome!

Two of Snyder's coauthored books include some information on
this projection for the forward case (geographic->cartesian) but
no information on the inverse.  Each description of the Roussilhe
is sufficiently different to make thing confusing.  Going
to the original article may be difficult for two reasons: language

Snyder has his own oblique stereographic and EPSG lists another
flavor.  At the moment, libproj4 only supports Snyder's version.

As for latitude of true scale, this is usually only used in the polar
version.  k_0 is more appropriate for oblique and equatorial.

If precision is not a criteria, then I suggest using Snyder's
Stereographic (in all versions of PROJ and probably in GRASS'.

BUT I can't read Polish.

Incidentally, some tables in above list k_0 factors.

Roussilhe once was the Hydrographer of the French Navy.  His oblique
stereographic projection is discussed by me in my September 2000 column on
the Grids and Datums of Poland.  (www.ASPRS.org/resources.html) Although
this is a double projection similar to what the late John P. Snyder
presented, John chose not to present the complete direct and inverse
formulae (that he asked for and that I mailed to him in the middle to late
1980s) since it was not a specific math model used by the United States
Geological Survey.

Roussilhe's work is not obscure.  It is published in the open "Annals
Hydrographique" journals of the early 1900s.  However, you DO have to be
able to read French, and you DO have to open the tomes and look for the
stuff.  Much of the original conformal developments on the ellipsoid of
revolution is in French.  It is not obscure unless you don't read French or
you do not care to try.

This same projection is used for many harbor surveys of the French Navy in
African coasts, both western and northern as well as southeastern around
Madagascar and Reunion.  It is kinda rare in the Pacific French colonies.
It was the national projection of Syria for about a century!

This happens to be a specific truncation of the Bulgarian Geodesist,
Hristow's developments published in "Zeitschrift fur Vermessungswessen" in
the 1930s and 1940s.

The EPSG source should only be used in cases of desperation.

Cliff Mugnier
LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY

----------------------------------------------------

Two of Snyder's coauthored books include some information on
this projection for the forward case (geographic->cartesian) but
no information on the inverse.  Each description of the Roussilhe
is sufficiently different to make thing confusing.  Going
to the original article may be difficult for two reasons: language
and obscurity.

Snyder has his own oblique stereographic and EPSG lists another

I have not been successful in posting this to the PROJ list; either of you
may
if you like.

I would be willing to send you a Xerox of (the relevant bits of) Roussilhe
and
of Letoval'tsev to Gerald if you want to add this projection to your code.
Consider it
in return for the usefulness of PROJ.

---------------
I am 2 minutes from a library with the Annales Hydrographiques. I first
looked up the reference given in Snyder & Steward's bibliography:

1974a. Roussilhe, Henri, 1922, Emploi des coordonnées rectangulaires
stéréographiques pour le calcul de la triangulation dans un rayon de 560
kilomètres autour de l'origine: International Union of Geodesy and
Geophysics, Section of Geodesy, Travaux, May, v. 1. [Roussilhe
stereographic projection of the ellipsoid.]

This references only papers by Courtier in the Annales for 1907 and 1912;
I did find these, but there do not seem to be any projection papers by
Roussilhe between 1897 and 1922 (the period I scanned), though the
projection
may be buried in his reports on the survey of Madagascar. The Courtier
papers
appear to be rather general discussions of the use of rectangular
coordinates,
derived for a variety of projections. Roussilhe's 1922 paper proposes a
particular
stereographic good to high accuracy over largish areas, ending with a set
of
proposed radial "zones" for all of Europe.

Snyder and Steward also reference

1442. Letoval'tsev, I.G., 1968, O proyektsii Russilya: Izvestiya Vysshikh
Uchebnykh Zavedeniy. Geodeziya i Aerofotos'emka, no. 2, p. 51-55.
[Russian. Translated to English as The Roussilhe projection: Geodesy and

translated to English in Geodesy and Aerophotography, 1968, no. 6, p. 418.]

which I have also looked at; this references Roussilhe's textbook of
1922--this
I have not seen.

So it seems that the libproj4's "Stereographic" projection is not suitable
here because it demands the "latitude of true scale". HOW DO YOU THINK? This
projection requires the k_0 "scale factor" too. This is not a problem - I
know the k_0 for all the "Uklad 1965" zones. But the definition of "Uklad
1965" doesn't mention such a parameter as the "LATITUDE OF TRUE SCALE" at
all.

To make things clear:
The 1965 System we are talking about consists of 5 zones, where four are in
Roussilhe and one is Transverse Mercator.
The Mercator one (5th zone) is not obscure at all and easily applicable in
Grass.
Those 1-4 Roussilhe ones are not obscure as well but I don't know how to
apply them into Grass.

I have some literature (doc and pdf) regarding "Uklad 1965" besides the
http://www.atomnet.pl/~geodeta/2000/59text1.htm .
They contain plenty of formulas which I don't get at all (I'm not
a cartographer or geodet or whatsoever). If you would like to have a look at
them I would send them to you and would assist you in trying to understand
Chineese with pleasure. Besides - I know one Polish amateur cartographer/GPS
fan who would help. He speaks English well so you coud try to consult him
too.

Sorry, I was being *Very* brief in my bibios:

Map Projection Transformation, 2000, Oihe Yang, JP Snyder and Tobler

Map Projections---A Reference Manual, 1995, Lev M Bugayevskiy & JP 
Snyder.

Both are available at Amazon.com.

+proj=stere uses +k_0 in oblique case (+lat_0 .ne. 90)

There is also +sterea (alternate stereographic in the libproj4 system.

Yes, I figured that from the Polish web site.  That part was pretty 
clear.

If I was using the PROJ4 system I would key the first zone as follows:

+proj=stere +lat_0=50d37'30 +lon_0=21d5' +x_0=5467000 +y_0=4637000
    +k_0=0.9998 +<ellipsoid parameters>

GRASS used PROJ a long time ago but I lost contact somewhat before
CERL stopped support.

Same script for sterea.

I would love to see it.  My main concern is that the material 
represents the
method used in "official" Polish applications.  I say this because I 
seem see at least
two different methods and wonder which one is the "real" one.

As I said, I think I could do a PROJ.4 version from the web site data 
as long
as I had someone to answer a few questions that may come up.  The 
language
of mathematics is pretty universal.

Also, "benchmark" values are also of *great* assistance:  That is know 
values
of  lat-lon == x-y.

But even if I get a successful process on libproj4, how does this help 
you
with your GRASS effort?

 From Snyder's descsription in "Flattening the Earth" of Rousilhe's 
projection
the equations given on pages 19 to 20 of "Map Projecrtion 
Transformations----
Principles and Applications" (Yang, et al) appears to be the original 
projection.
It is unclear to me what the purpose of the tmerc<-->Semi-Stereo 
described
later in the same book and others.

Upon closer reading, I'll correct my earlier statement to: full forward 
*and*
inverse material is included.  The only problem at the moment is that
some symbols are not defined and guesses need to fill in the blanks.
And, of course, the nasty habit of using the lower-case L as a symbol.
Currently working on retypesetting to American nomenclature/symbols.
(\phi, \lambda) not (B,l).

Hopefully, bench mark conversions can be located later.

Nuts, Nuts, Nuts.

There seem to be several errors on p. 20.  They look like typos with
reasonable guess corrections but they throw doubt on the whole
work.

Does anyone know if there is an errata sheet for "Map Projection
Transformation---Principles and Applications" by Qihe, Snyder and

When I try to use the "stere" projection in my Grass 5.0.3 it asks for the
"Latitude of True Scale [lat_ts]".
And you don't provide this parameter in your example script. How come?
Besides this [lat_ts] is the only one input I don't know for mymap.
And you give the x_0 and y_0 while my Grass doesn't ask for them. What's
up?
(Should I send you the step by step listing of the Grass' interface during
the "stere" projection application?)

I thought Grass has been utililizing the libproj4 permanently. Or am I
wrong? If I'm not then I could install the 'fixed' libproj4 and be happy.

for example here comes the info.txt from the libproj0-4.4.7-1mdk.i586.rpm
installed on my Mandrake 9.2 with Grass 5.03:

Message-ID: <000e01c407e0$a985bf40$6600a8c0@HP>

As a dabbler who is only using the shpcs2cs function to convert a NAD27 Lambert Conformal Conic shapefile to NAD83 latitude/longitude, I'm unsure if I need the grid shift files in subdirectory \nad.  My example is a shapefile representing the geological formations on a geologic map of Arizona.

My command line is

shpcs2cs AZ_GEOL.shp AZ_GEOLll83.shp -v +proj=lcc +datum=NAD27 +lon_0=-96 +lat_1=33 +lat_2=45 +lat_0=23 +x_0=5000000 +y_0=0 +to +proj=latlong +datum=NAD83

and it seems to make no difference to the output whether conus.lla is in the \bin directory or not.  With the low resolution of this particular file, it is hard to check whether the result is really NAD83 or not.  Can you tell me what transformation cs2cs actually applies in this case?  (I have seen suggestions in the documentation that the program doesn't complain if files are missing, it just skips steps that require them.)  Am I missing a step?  I'm not going to be using proj often enough to become an expert.

Tom,

I'm not sure where shpcs2cs comes from.  I presume this is a version
of shpproj reimplemented to use the mechanisms of cs2cs?  I seem to
recall someone having contributed that but I don't know the details.

The conus.lla file is raw ascii grid shift file.  It isn't used directly.
First it has to be processed into a binary grid shift file with the nad2bin
program.  I would guess it is being ignored.

If you just want to convert shapefiles, I would suggest using the
prepackaged OpenEV_FW 1.6.3 distribution which includes the ogr2ogr program
which can accomplish the same thing.  The distribution also includes the
binary form of the grid shift files.

OpenEV_FW 1.6.3 can be found at:

   ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/gdal/openev/OpenEV_FW_163.zip

A command something like this would accomplish approximately what you were
trying to do:

   ogr2ogr AZ_GEOLll83.shp AZ_GEOL.shp \
     -s_srs '+proj=lcc +datum=NAD27 +lon_0=-96 +lat_1=33 +lat_2=45 +lat_0=23 +x_0=5000000 +y_0=0' \
     -t_srs '+proj=latlong +datum=NAD83'

Of course it might be sufficient for you to run nad2bin on conus.lla to
produce conus and then ensure that the PROJ_LIB environment variable points
to the directory with the conus file.

Good luck,
--

You presume correctly.  shpcs2cs comes from a link on the Shapefile C
Library home page:

Tom Russo has implemented a shpcs2cs program, which reprojects shapefiles
using arguments similar to the PROJ.4 cs2cs program including datum
conversion. Use as an alternate to the contrib/shpproj which doesn't do
datums. It is available at the bottom of Tom's Xastir Shapefile Resources
page.

It's a variant of your cs2cs with shapefile input/output done by the
Shapefile C Library.  (I think Mr. Russo says 90% of the code is cs2cs.)

I used nad2bin from your binary distribution to make conus from conus.llb,
set the environment variable and reran shpcs2cs.  It changed the shapefile I
got out from what I got out before.  No doubt I should dig around a little
in both shapefiles in a binary editor to see if I believe the difference
really reflects the difference between NAD27 and NAD83.  I rather resist
that though -- sure to be tedious and confusing.

Thanks for your help.

A clarification:

GRASS whatever uses PROJ (not libproj4 from G. Evenden) by
default, in details:

- GRASS 4.x + 5.0 use the old PROJ4 from USGS (included in source code)
- GRASS 5.3/5.7 use the (fresh) external PROJ4 from remotesensing.org 
  by default, but can be compiled to use the old PROJ4 from USGS 
  (as still included in source code)

GRASS was changed to use the external PROJ4 from remotesensing.org to
utilize the datum transformation routines and the latest fixes.

[...]

[...]
Mandrake provides PROJ4 from remotesensing.org.

Our hope is that in future PROJ4 from remotesensing.org will be based on
the updated libproj4 from G. Evenden + include the datum transformation
routines.

It might be possible to compile GRASS 5.3/5.7 against libproj4 from 
G. Evenden (since the API is similar), but AFAIK you will then miss
the datum transformation routines.

Hope this helps

Message-ID: <678CDF8D-743A-11D8-98B0-000A958A3346@verizon.net>

This is a short history of PROJ[4].

Beginnings: in the late 70's I became involved in putting together map
plotting software for USGS,  Branch of Atlantic Geology in Woods Hole, 
MA.
Although I had previous experience in the problems of cartographic
projections and graphics in the Denver office, something more 
comprehensive
was needed.

Up to that era cartographic projection software was a scarce commodity
and the only things available were a package from the CIA and Topo's
GCTP (General Cartographic Transformation Package).  GCTP was close
to what we needed *but* was not conducive to be incorporated into
other software and was/is a nightmare of internal coding.  Being raised
on Algol, FORTRAN was always a very painful experience.

Through the next decade our mapping program evolved through
several stages and languages.  First to RATFOR and eventually to C.
Each stage was also evolutionary as to program structure; both of the
graphics as well as the projections.  I must point out that I kept the
two processes almost completely separated as I felt the projection
material had uses other than just making maps.

During this period the terms MAPGEN and PROJ became designations
for the software.  During later stages and even more refinement, the
tern PROJ.4 was adopted.  Advent of commercial graphic software finally
caused the demise of the MAPGEN system which was purely vector
oriented and for large scale applications.

Since PROJ is as much avocational as vocational I continued involvement
and expanded capabilities of the system after retirement some 10 years 
ago.
The distribution available at the USGS site kai.er.usgs.gov represents 
the
level at the time of my retirement.

I finally decided that I should get the PROJ system out of the datum 
business
that was contained in the last USGS release as the areas covered was
only for the US and was not very general.  Thus libproj4 was born: a 
system
restricted to geographic/Cartesian transformations.  The elements that 
I was
interested in and most able to support.  Nad2nad was dropped as
well as approximation functions and the name of the sample application
pipe was changed from "proj" to "lproj."

Thus the confusion began.  Most applications out there are based upon
the PROJ.4 distribution and are not compatible with the libproj4 
distribution
without some changes.  Remotesensing has used the PROJ4 material and
added a number of internal changes which make updating to libproj4
a significant software effort.  I believe GRASS falls into the same
category.

As a postscript I must add that several years ago information on datums
and their conversions outside the US was a mysterious area.  Information
was hard to come by and one was viewed as a dangerous spy if you asked
about such matters.  So who needed this grief and I dropped any 
interest.

I'm sure a lot of Proj users are transforming WGS84 GPS data into the
various datums of the world before the cartesian projection is performed.  

It seems a shame to omit the datum transform functionality from libproj.
The lack of datum transforms forces a lot of people to stick with Proj, even
though libProj is more current.

restricted to geographic/Cartesian transformations.  The elements that 
I was
interested in and most able to support.  Nad2nad was dropped as
well as approximation functions and the name of the sample application
pipe was changed from "proj" to "lproj."

Thus the confusion began.  Most applications out there are based upon
the PROJ.4 distribution and are not compatible with the libproj4 
distribution
without some changes.  Remotesensing has used the PROJ4 material and
added a number of internal changes which make updating to libproj4
a significant software effort.  I believe GRASS falls into the same
category.

As a postscript I must add that several years ago information on datums
and their conversions outside the US was a mysterious area.  Information
was hard to come by and one was viewed as a dangerous spy if you asked
about such matters.  So who needed this grief and I dropped any 
interest.

Sam and others,

Geralds decision to concentrate on a core library focused on projection
translation is sensible.  My intention, when time permits, is to refactor
the remotesensing.org version to use Geralds core and then provide services
for datum conversion, prime meridians, alternate axes, dictionary lookup and
so forth at a higher level.

However, I haven't been spending much time on PROJ.4 development, and it isn't
clear how long it might be till such a refactoring gets done.  If there are
other compentent programs interested in leading such an effort, I would be
interested in discussing it.

In the meantime I intend to port some of the new (and improved) projections
from Geralds library into the remotesensing.org proj.4 from time to time.  So
we should still benefit from most of Geralds improvements in the meantime.

hello Everyone

Thanks to you Gerald, Markus and Frank for your explanations on the "proj"
stuff in Grass.

Despite of it I stiill don't know how to apply the desired projection into
Grass 5.03.
Just in case here go the details once more:
name: in Poland it's called Roussilhe or Quasi-Stereographic
other names I saw: Roussilhe Oblique Stereographic
described as: azimuthal, oblique, conformal

parameters for one of the total 4 zones for Poland in this projection
("System 1965"):
lat_0=50d37'30
lon_0=21d5'
x_0=5467000
y_0=4637000
k_0=0.9998
ellipsoid: Krassovsky, Pulkovo 1942 datum modified for Poland

How to apply this projection in Grass 5.03?
As far as I understood it is not possible with the old PROJ4 from USGS
included in source code of Grass 5.03?
Could the problem be solved if I compiled the Grass source with the fresh
external PROJ4 from remotesensing.org? Is there a projection that fits the
one I need included?

Something propably stupid but let me know what you think:
I suppose the "stere" projection is the closest match for Roussilhe. But the
"stere" projection in "regular" Grass 5.03 doesn't ask for x_0 and y_0 which
Roussilhe demands. This "stere" also asks for the "latitude of true scale"
while the Roussilhe definition doesn't provide such parameter.
So I MANUALLY made a PROJ_INFO like the one below. Would it work if I put it
into my mapset (Grass 5.03 installed from an rpm provided by Mandrake on
Mandrake 9.2)? Or is it completely rubbish?

name: Stereographic
datum:
dx: 23.740000
dy: -123.830000
dz: -81.810000
proj: stere
ellps: krassovsky
a: 6378245.0000000000
es: 0.0066934216
f: 298.3000000000
lat_0: 51.6708333333
lon_0: 16.6722222222
x_0: 5467000
y_0: 4637000
k_0: 0.9998000000

please help

Delete the empty datum: line and then this will work perfectly
(assuming the projection parameters are correct). Don't worry that GRASS
didn't ask you for some of the parameters. There is no definitive list of
the parameters for each projection (except in Gerald's head maybe! :) )
and GRASS just has a guess at prompting you for the correct ones but it
gets it wrong for some projections.

Make sure you have a PROJ_UNITS file as well (the one generated by g.setproj
should be OK).

You don't need the name: line but it does no harm. Also the lines
1. ellps: krassovsky
2. a: 6378245.0000000000
3. es: 0.0066934216
4. f: 298.3000000000
are partially redundant. Either 1 on its own, 2+3 or 2+4 will do fine.

Aw c'mon now.  I beg to differ on that point.  The first publication on
PROJ (the open-file report) goes into all but some added parameters
included in the second report (all on the USGS web site and others).

Individual projections (especially the ellipsoidal ones) have added
documentation as to parameters not in the "base" list.  By base list
I mean parameters that apply to most projections like ellipsoid
parameters, false easting/northing, central parallel, latitude of
origin, sphere radii based on ellipsoid characteristics, k_0, etc..

The [l]proj -lP option gives parameters unique to individual
projections (other than the base list).

The new "book" documentation I'm working on now gives the
equations and thus parameters for *all* projections in libproj4.
I'm up to 80 pages now and figure I am only about half done.
And its got pictures too!

Again, I want to make one point *perfectly* clear: there is no Roussilhe
projection of any kind in *any* version of PROJ.

I am working on that issue now and I will hopefully come up with
two versions: one that is probably what Roussilhe first designed and
a second that seems to be used by the Poles for their grid systems.

The *only* stereographic projection in libproj4 (and earlier versions) 
is
Snyder's which is basically a Gauss conversion to the sphere with
some other scale tweeking and uses the spherical oblique stereographic
projection.

Based upon past performance, the new projections will be available
in a couple of weeks if I can correctly interpret the material on hand.
Note: documentation is being coded now and I am cutting some code
for the simple Gauss conversion.

When and if this material *ever* appears in GRASS software is a
speculation far beyond my realm of knowledge.

As for Snyder's version in proj the applicable projection parameters
are: <+ellps=> or <+a= and +es- or +rf= etc.>  +proj=stere +k_0=
+lat_0= +lon+0= +x_0= +y_0=.  How GRASS gets them into PROJ
need GRASS's manual(s).

What is the accuracy? I need circa 1m. Is it possible if I use the 'stere'
projection for Polish Roussilhe grid?

Do you need any help with the Polish papers?
Besides: I've got 2 *.xls calculators for GPS to "1965" grid conversion
based somewhat on Gauss-Kruger (I don't quite get it how). Maybe you could
make some use of them?

The ability of one algorithm to repeat a transformation within a certain
level of accuracy to another algorithm is a function of the distance from
the projection origin.

Your question is likely impossible to answer until both algorithms are at
hand and one does a "sensitivity analysis."  By that time, the question is
only academic anyway since you do have the exactly proper algorithm to
transform whatever it is at hand.

As an aside to the discussion about the Roussilhe Stereographics there
are already two stereographics in libproj4: 1) Snyder's that uses the
simplified conformal latitude expresion (+proj=stere) and 2) a version
that used the full feature conformal latitude expression (+proj=sterea).

Using libproj4's internal verbosity procedures (-V) the later method
is slight more accurate in terms of scale error.

The "full feature" conformal latitude routine is also used in the
Krovak and Swiss projections.  Note that both versions of the
Roussilhe versions use the simplified conformal procedure.

You see that with all these damn details why I do not want to become
involved with datum processes.  Another interesting detail is that
Frederick Pearson, II is the only current author I can find that deals
with the full version of the conformal conversion and even he discards
the integration constant that is computed in the libproj4 software.
As I recall, Snyder did not have a kind opinion of Pearson but I've
forgotten why.

Aren't projections fun?

Igor,

Melita Kennedy (ESRI) has kindly pointed out that +es is eccentricity squared
while you appear to be using a flattening value for the parameter:

You wrote:
 >Flattening     +es=0.00336700336700273

 From Page 9 of of90-284.pdf the earth figure parameters are:

   a - semimajor axis
   b - semiminor axis
   f - flattening
  rf - reciprocal flattening (1/f)
   e - eccentricity
  es - eccentricity squared

Perhaps you should have specified +f=0.00336700336700273?

I don't know if this is your problem, but certainly it would potentially
have a radical effect on your earth figure if you use the wrong parameter.

The Polish form of the Roussilhe forward option is coded and 
syntactically
debugged.  Some problems are evident via the -V information but I have
just started.

Several of you have offered help including translations.

The biggest assistance at the moment---in fact a requirement--- is for
benchmark conversions of geographic coordinates to Polish grid
system for one of the 4 stereographic zones.  That is:

lat-lon <-> x-y that is officially recognized and the ellipsoid factors 
used.

Many thanks.

Current forward for the Polish stereographic shows 2.6x10^-5 %
error and conformality with the -V option.

I desperately NEED Polish benchmarks for any one of the four

Maciek,

What Gerald needs are some correct transformation results or examples.  In
other words he needs points with the proper latitiude and longitude in
degrees-minutes-seconds-and decimal parts of seconds to at least 0.001
along with the corresponding X and Y coordinates of the same points to a
precision of at least 1 millimeter.  Preferably he would like a number of
points, all in one zone (identified by you as to which one), and these
points would be in increasing distances from the projection origin.

Those distances would preferably be 10 km, 100 km, 200 km, etc. up to say,
500 km from the zone origin.

With the EXACT coordinates for each point in latitude and longitude as well
as X and Y coordinates he can check and verify his algorithm, the False
Origin arithmetic, and the "round-trip" repeatablity of his subroutines.
If possible, he'd also like the computed scale factor at the point as well
as the convergence angle or grivation (angle between Grid North and True
North for each of the points provided).  This sort of information is easily
supplied by a government geodesist if they are inclined to assist and
cooperate.

As for the scale errors, this is not necessarity a problem.  Scale 
checks
in both axis agree to precision presented thus demonstating conformal
behavior.  Note these values are computed by numerical derivatives
and subject to the problems of precision of the method used.  I use this
method when there is no other way to check the behavior of the]
projection.  That is why the -V option is included in the program 
[l]proj.

As to benchmark values:  the ideal method is to use the method used
by the government to compute their conversions----or anything officially
recognized.  Sometimes a source is listing of points in a grid with both
their geodetic and grid systems values.  If someone has access to
ESRI software they may have it and you could run a couple points
through their system.

A bit stalled on the inverse---part of the problem is that some of the
equations do not make sense and I suspect typos.  As a last resort I
penned an email to the address at the bottom of the reference site
on the off chance he/she can read English.

Reviewed one of the sites suggested earlier (by :Lamparski)
http://www.navi.pl/produkty/ssl/uklady/uklady.html

which has even another quasi-stereographic.  Sigh.  This one
is single step and looks vaguely like the Qihe,Snyder,Tobler version.
I said vaguely!  There are a couple of *odd* things about the equations.
One thing about the OST version is that it goes through isometric
latitude rather than conformal latitude.  Isometric is messy as it
behaves like Mercator y and goes infinite as you proceed to the
poles.  Conformal latitude behaves itself nicely.

The Lamparski site is bizarre because latitude is noted as "b" in
the equations for  x-y but it is usually noted "B" everywhere else.  He
uses "b" earlier as minor axis length.

Probably should spend the time to get the original reference but I
am not sure that is what is truly being used by the Poles.

I sent an email to Tobler but I have not received a response.

To paraphrase and old US TV program: "Will the real Roussilhe
Polish Quasi-Stereographic  projection please stand up."

Message-ID: <24E2812C-7C35-11D8-8A81-000A958A3346@verizon.net>

Someone on a Remotesensing email group suggested that I write you
regarding the Roussilhe projection used by Polish grids.  Apparently
you have a reputation as being interested in GPS and thus may have
some knowledge of this subject area.

My involvement in this problem is maintaining general cartographic
projection software in the public domain that is used by the 
Remotesensing
group.

At the current time we have located two sources related to this 
projection:

http://www.atomnet.pl/~geodeta/2000/59text1.htm

and

http://www.navi.pl/produkty/ssl/uklady/uklady.html

I have successfully obtained forward conversion by both methods but
have yet to perform the inverse projection function.  In either case I 
do not
know which one is the version used by those involved with the Polish
grid systems.

Also of critical value are some example cases where points are
given in both geographic and grid system coordinates that can be
used a test values for my programs.

Another impediment is my inability to read Polish.

Any information you might have related to this problem would be
greatly appreciated.

Thank-you for your time.

I received a reply from Mr. Syryjczyk who indicated that he would see 
if he
could locate some material.

Pending any information he may eventually return and my requests for
the translations of the Russian article on the grid, I am suspending 
current
activities on this projection.  I can't see spending more time on the 
inverse
of either of the Polish versions until I get a better idea of which one 
is
correct.

The original circa 1922 books or whatever seem too obscure and difficult
to find a source.  Scanning the LOC and a couple of other libraries
yielded nothing.

Message-ID: <9B9BB1A8-7D31-11D8-B71B-000A958A3346@verizon.net>

I have developed a great deal of reservations about the book "Map 
Projection
Transformation: Principles and Applications" by Qihe Yang, John Snyder 
and
Waldo Tobler.  The recent activity on the Rossilhe projection and its 
version
in the book having an obvious typo (end of line 2 of eqn. 2.2.25, p.20) 
and
a suspicious looking equation (last line of eqn. 2.2.28, p.20) bothered 
me.

Also on page 79 nomenclature gets a little different compared to 
Snyder's
usage in PP 1395 regarding what I would call the isometric latitude.  
After
eqn 3.5.2 "q" is referred to as the "conformal latitude function or 
conformal
isometric latitude."  I am used to most sources referring only the 
isometric
latitude.  Obviously a simple matter of style.

Note on eqn 3.3.5 "tan" is omitted from the equation for the conformal
latitude (page 79).

After a superficial use of a dozen or so pages of this book I have found
sufficient material to make me apprehensive of any further usage.  It 
appears
to be sloppily proofed.  The style of the prose if often too terse and 
reads more
like a math function handbook than an informative text book.

According to P.B. Anderson, this was the book Snyder was working on
at the time of his death.  At the moment I feel it it is an unfortunate
legacy.

The typos are an indication of the exquisite care John took with his books
and publications when he was around to do it.  Since this tome was
published after his death, the comparison is striking.  For those that knew
John, it actually is an excellent legacy for the old Quaker.  From the
grave he's saying, "See, I told you so!"

Considering the claims that the Russians invented damn near everything
under the sun in map projections from what the book by Bugayevskiy and
Snyder (and obviously claimed by the Russian) ... John's infinite patience,
courtesy, diplomacy and grace managed to get the book into print anyway.

Rest in peace, John.

After shelving the Roussilhe for the moment I shifted back to trying to 
find more
information on the even more elusive Schreiber Transverse Mercator 
projection.
While googling thought a desperate selection choice and 8,000 results I 
hit
upon  GPSmanhttp://www.ncc.up.pt/~mig/gpsman.html wherein lay a tcl
procedure to "Schreiber Stereographic."

This turned out to be the same as libproj4's +sterea (Alternate 
Stereographic)
projection which is a double conversion through the Gauss sphere.  I 
could
not pin down the creators source for the name but it seems to indicate 
that
Schreiber had a thing for the double conversion and may have applied it 
to
the Transverse Mercator problem as well.  Snyder in "Flattening the 
World"
describes the Schreiber as a double conversion.

The next release of libproj4 will contain the "stmerc" projection 
tentatively
called the Schreiber Transverse Mercator.  As Snyder indicated, the 
scale
error is not zero along the central meridian but from what I find, 
follows a
rather bizarre path.

Hi,

I'm afraid that these may be very obscure coordinate
systems, but it can't hurt to ask.

We have customers who deal with oil field data using two
local coordinate systems for Southern California which
are known as "Henry Ford Coordinates" and "Federal Deadman
Island Coordinates."  Both are measured in feet and
are rotated (differently) w.r.t. true north.

I have plenty of details on converting between these
two, as well as some test points in these two plus
geographic and State Plane zone 407 (NAD27).

I don't want to bore anyone with too many details, but
on the odd chance that one of you has any experience with
either of these systems, I figured I'd ask if it was
possible to work with either using PROJ?

Thanks in advance,

carl

That would be terrific; thanks very much in advance.  I'm having
