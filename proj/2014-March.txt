Hi,

   I've been pointed to this list after posting my question to the
German FOSSGIS-talk list (FOSSGIS is the German OSGeo chapter).

Among the things I do for a living is making raster images from
OpenStreetMap data, usually through the "Mapnik" renderer which has
Proj4 support built-in. Someone recently asked whether I could make them
an image in the "Equal Arc" projection in GeoTIFF format, and I naively
said "sure, give me the EPSG code and I'll work it out". I had never
heard the term "Equal Arc" and I somewhat assumed that the inquirer
probably meant one of the common "Equal Area" projections.

But I was wrong; what the client-in-spe is looking for is indeed the
"Equal Arc" projection that is defined here

https://portal.dgiwg.org/files/?artifact_id=3923

and which, as far as I can see, has neither an EPSG code nor anything
remotely machine readable like a WKT or Proj4 projection description.
Even so, it seems to be widely used in aviation, and it seems to be an
integral part of so-called ADRG files. These ADRG files can even be
"experimentally" written by GDAL:

http://www.gdal.org/frmt_various.html

but of course these aren't GeoTIFFs then. I wonder:

1. Is it at all technically possible to have a GeoTIFF in Equal Arc
projection, given that I could not find any represenation of that
projection suitable for including in a GeoTIFF header?

2. If the answer to (1) is "yes", then can I create such a GeoTIFF with
GDAL, or possibly even by passing a clever Proj init string to the
Mapnik renderer?

3. If the answer to (2) is "no", then is this just an issue where
someone would have to spend some time adding support to Proj (with any
luck I could get the client-in-spe to fund this work), or are there
fundamental reasons barring us from doing that?

My internet research regarding "Equal Arc" was unsatisfying; the name
"FalconView" appeared a number of times in conjunction with this
projection.

Thank you for any insights you might have on this.

Each zone would just be a different projection parameterization; is there some reason that would be too unwieldy for you?

Equal arc just means equal arc increments in latitude and longitude.  In
other words the projection is just ordinary longitude and latitude.
Here is gdalinfo on a sample file.  This is for a CADRG (compressed arc
digitized raster graphics) map.  To comply with ARC specifications, it
may be necessary to pick the size, resolution, and tiling of the imagery
specifically.  However, the projection is simple.

Duh. That sounds a good deal simpler than I thought. Thank you.

Am I then right in saying that a request like "I want an image in Equal
Arc projection with a pixel size of 6 metres by 6 metres" does not make
a lot of sense, since the width of a pixel will be constant in arc
increments, and therefore not constant in metres?

Products like CIB05 are equal arc with nominal resolution 5m x 5m.  What
this means is that the longitude resolution is fixed at
0.000044956841432 deg (about 5m) and the latitude resolution is fixed in
each latitude "zone" to give a roughly the same ground spacing.  For
example, 004VB41A.I23 is centered at 52d6'3.68"N, its resolution, is

   Pixel Size = (0.000073242187500,-0.000044956841432)

or about 5.015m x 5.002m.  The size of a CIB05 tile is about 7.5 km x
7.5km so this ground resolution is nearly constant across the image.

You can obviously do something similar if the requested resolution is
6m x 6m.

Got latitude and longitude switched!!  I should have said

Products like CIB05 are equal arc with nominal resolution 5m x 5m.  What
this means is that the latitude resolution is fixed at 0.000044956841432
deg (about 5m) and the longitude resolution is fixed in each latitude

Charles,

Further below, you wrote:
 >>>>> Equal arc just means equal arc increments in latitude
 >>>>> and longitude.

Then your example 004VB41A.I23 comes with:
 >>>  Pixel Size = (0.000073242187500,-0.000044956841432)

To me, the above resolution doesn't look like equal increments in 
latitude and longitude. What am I missing here?

Sorry, that's badly worded.  The increments in "x" are equal longitude
arcs and the increments in "y" are equal latitude arcs.  Typically these
two increments are different (although for data close to the equator
they will often be the same.)

Subject: [Proj] Expanding a proj4 CRS definition
Message-ID: <CA+L60sBP0h2RvxdPyGAOa3zX5YzoGbZgfMXRo2=JuyOegL5D3A@mail.gmail.com>

I'm curious to know whether it is possible for proj4 to return a complete
representation of a projection definition. For instance, supposing I gave a
proj4 string of:

+proj=merc

It would be useful to get back a projection definition such as:

+proj=merc +lat_ts=0 ...

Similarly, though this is less important to me, is it possible to go from:

+init=epsg:3309

To

+proj=aea +lat_1=34 +lat_2=40.5 ...

Without just returning the string found in share/proj/epsg?

I guess what I'm really asking whether there is an internal representation
of these values which can then be used to pump out a string suitable for
passing through to proj4 later on?

Thanks in advance,

Phil

gdalsrsinfo does exactly that.

What else should it return? That is the proj string behind the EPSG code.

I guess you are looking for default values which you don't want to add 
explicitly.

You can play with gdalsrsinfo and look what it returns on incomplete input.

As you said, I'm interested in the expansion of the defaults, not just the
values directly from the lookup.

Exactly. Thank you for pointing me at gdalsrsinfo - that is exactly what I
was looking for!

All the best,

Phil

Hi,
I work for a company where we have our custom mercator projection.
I already developed code snippets to integrate such projection in proj4 4.8.0  (c++).
Is there the chance to collaborate with develop team to integrate it in proj4 main trunk? 

Thanks and best regards,

Raul Pra Levis

Hello,

could you tell us why do you have a custom mercator
projection? and what is custom in it?

Regards: Janne.
