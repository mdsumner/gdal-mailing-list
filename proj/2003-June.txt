Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Projection of historic maps WW II - Italy
Message-ID: <20030606165010.F18365@itc.it>

Dear List members,

I would appreciate assistance for the following problem:

Currently I try to define a map projection for a map from 1945,
Northern Italy. The map was made by the US Army Engr. Top. Co.
in Lambert Conic Orthomorphic. It is based on a map from 1931 
done by Istituto Geografico Militare and was enhanced by aerial
photo surveys in 1944.

Given on the (scanned) paper map is:
- prime meridian Monte Mario (old!): 12d27'7.1E (in PROJ: 12d27'8.4E)
- "spheroid":     Bessel
- Origin:         14E, 45:54N
- False Easing:   800000 meters
- False Northing: 601000 meters
- The map provides the LCC grid and coordinates as well as
  Lat/Long corners in reference to Monte Mario 12d27'7.1E (given as
  "West from Rome" and Equator.

This projection I am defining in GRASS GIS which is based on the latest
PROJ from CVS. The parameters in GRASS style are (PROJ_INFO file)

name: Lambert Conformal Conic
towgs84: -104.1,-49.1,-9.9,0.971,-2.917,0.714,-11.68
proj: lcc
ellps: bessel
a: 6377397.1550000003
es: 0.0066743722
f: 299.1528128000
lat_1: 45.9
lon_0: 14.0000000000
x_0: 800000.0000000000
y_0: 601000.0000000000

The towgs84 parameter will be certainly wrong.

Using these values I achieve as accuracy a shift 70m eastwards and 
170m northwards. For verification GIS data in Gauss-Boaga projection
from different providers were using (vector street map and orthophotos).
These maps I have reprojected into above LCC projection and compared to
the scanned and geocoded map from 1945:

For illustration there is a screenshot of a zoomed area:

(1MB)
http://mpa.itc.it/markus/tmp/lcc_1945_ortho2000_small.png
(500kb)

To improve the accuracy, I am seeking assistance to find out:
- which Bessel definition should be used (is above right for these 1945 maps?)
- which datum was used in 1945 (Italian or US or ...)
- how to define a different prime meridian: 12d27'7.1E instead of 12d27'8.4E
  (can I define a custom prime meridian?)

Thanks in advance

Markus,

The Bessel 1841 parameters you listed are correct.  The Monte Mario Datum
of 1875 is not going to be significantly different from the current Monte
Mario Datum of 1940.  The Istituto Geografico Militare occasionally "lets
out" datum shift parameters from their national datum to WGS84, but the
parameters vary considerably from one region of Italy to another.  They are
the only RELIABLE source of such transformation parameters.

The projection parameters you list are correct, but the scale factor at
origin is 0.998992911

If you obtain some reliable datum shift parameters, please share them with
the list including your source and the area for which they are applicable.

Thanks for the quick answer! The changed scale factor moves the map
into another direction now - there is still some hundred meters of
deviation. I will have to "play" with the towgs84 parameter.

Here are some (you may know them already):

Looks good and it seems to work so I have added it to the GRASS CVS.

cs2cs doesn't look in the current directory by default; you need to use
+nadgrids=./nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb for example, but I think you knew that.

If you run g.setproj in GRASS and select the nzgd49 datum, it should now
offer you the choice of using the grid for your datum transformation
parameters. You will need to have the latest PROJ.4.4.7 installed and have
compiled GRASS using the --with-proj option to the configure script. (The
version of PROJ that comes with GRASS won't work with NTv2 files.)

Also (this may be of interest to PROJ people as well), I didn't get any
feedback on my NTv2 file for France yet. Is it useful to anybody and / or
does it work?

Hi Christopher,

The usage of the proj utility  under Microsoft einvirionment is a litte 
bit tricky because it is build for a unix environment and looks for
a standard directory called .....\nad\ in the distribution. But there is 
a routine tht tries to find that directory in 3 or 4 way

1. in /usr/locale/proj
2. in /usr/home/~/proj
3. in /bin/proj I' think not shure
4. via a environment vatriaable via proj_lib=....

I doi'nt know  what DLL do yo use. In my distribution I have the
same problems and add a new initalization routine in C.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
// proj_init_plus_path for the Win32 Borland Environment
// ..written by A. Weidauer alex.weidauer at huckfinn.de
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#include <string.h>.h"
#include "projects.h"

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
static char *ProjDataPath = NULL;
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
static const char *ProjFileFinder( const char *aFile )
{
      static char *aLastPath = NULL;

      if( ProjDataPath == NULL )
          return aFile;

      if( aLastPath != NULL )
         free( aLastPath );
      aLastPath = (char *) malloc(strlen(ProjDataPath)+strlen(aFile)+2);
      strcpy( aLastPath, ProjDataPath );
      strcat( aLastPath, "\\" );
      strcat( aLastPath, aFile );
      return aLastPath;
}
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------
PJ * pj_init_plus_path( const char *definition, const char *aDataPath )
{
    if( aDataPath != NULL )   {
       if( ProjDataPath != NULL )
           free( ProjDataPath );
       ProjDataPath = strdup(aDataPath);
    }
    pj_set_finder( ProjFileFinder );
    return pj_init_plus(definition);
}

If not you use my API (..see http://www.tripleware.huckfinn.de

So in the DLL version 4.4.7 it should work like this (Sorry vcode as 
pascal).

       // load transformation gk4-d from file ..\nad\world
       pj :=_pj_init_plus_path
       ('+proj=tmerc +ellps=bessel +lon_0=12 +x_0=500000'
                              ,'.\\nad');
       // if projection allocation fails
       If (pj=NIL) Then Begin
        // check error conditions
        cnt:=_pj_get_errno_ref;
        S:=String(_pj_strerrno(cnt));
        Writeln('error by init !',S);
        Readln;
        Exit;
       End;

I hope you will translate it in your language  and it will help you 
succesfull . If there more problems send me a mail.

There probably will be several issues to solve to make Visual Basic work
with proj.  I don't have example code, but here are a few ideas.

Part of the problem is that VB uses structures for arrays and strings.  So a
way is needed to create an array of pointers to the string data that proj
will accept.

1. An array of Longs should work to hold the 4-byte pointers.

2. Getting a pointer to string data is tough in VB.  You might use a Windows
kernel function like lstrcatA to get it roundabout.

Declare Function GetStringPointer Lib "kernel32" Alias "lstrcatA" (ByVal
lpString1 As String, ByVal lpString2 As String) As Long

3.  Psuedocode

  Dim Params(0 to 2) as Long

  Str1 = "proj=utm"
  Params(0) = GetStringPointer(Str1, "")
  Str2 = "zone=11"
  Params(0) = GetStringPointer(Str2, "")
  ... create more parameters here
  Response = pj_init(3, Params(0))

4. I didn't check the parameters you gave, but I think it needs a "no_defs"
at the end.

I haven't tested these ideas with proj, but I hope they are helpful.

For a low cost DLL UTM converter that is directly compatible with VB, you
might look at the Effective Objects DLLs at
www.eobj.com/products-mapping-software.html.  It could save a lot of time in
debugging.

Hello,

the main problem is, that the proj.dll is not usable by VB because of the 
function declarations. They have to be declared with __stdcall.
So not:
   void pr_xxx(..);
but:
   #include <windows.h> 	
   void __stdcall pr_xxx(..);

Then it should work.

Hi Christopher,

May be it is sensefull to write a ocx control for the proj library?
Has anybode sutch a control in C++ because I writing in Delphi and
it seem to be wrong to use a DLL written in C set on top a API in Delphi
and write a OCX to get it for visual basic ?

Bye Alex

Hi Thomas but if you use the  _cdecl it should work
here a code snippet from my API

Function  _pj_init_plus_path(const Args: PChar; const Path: PChar):
           PProjPJ ;cdecl;external LibName;

{ forward projection normally Longitude Latitude to plain xy Coordinates }
Function  _pj_fwd(ProjLP:TProjLP; projPJ:PProjPJ):TProjXY;
           cdecl;external LibName;

{ inverse projection normally plain xy coordinates to longitude latitude 
coordinates }
Function  _pj_inv(ProjXY:TProjXY; projPJ:PProjPJ):TProjLP;
           cdecl;external LibName;

Bye Alex
