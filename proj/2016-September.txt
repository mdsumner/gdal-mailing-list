I just tested 4.9.3RC3 against GDAL -trunk. No build issue. A few failed tests 
to adjust probably due to the switch to etmerc for utm.

OK, 2 of the 3 failed tests were due to me having forgotten to install the 
'conus' grid from the extra grid package, and the last one was indeed due to 
UTM now relying on etmerc and its super wide validity range. So everything's 
OK from my side.

I tested on netbsd-7 amd64 (all ok, and postgis built against it passes
its tests) and OS X 10.9 amd64 (proj tests ok).

So promoting this to release sounds good to me.

Kristian,

Thanks to your efforts generating a script to render the projections in a similar fashion as Gerald's PostScript files. I have taken those and updated the website http://proj4.org/projections/index.html

The idea is to provide an individual page for each projection that Proj.4 supports, and we would put all math and relevant supporting materials about that projection at that location. Something like http://proj4.org/projections/sinu.html There is a ton of material in the PostScript files (I do wish we had the original latex so there wasn't risk to getting the math notation wrong) that needs to be brought into these "projection pages", but we now have some scaffolding to support people contributing to this effort.

Thanks again!

Howard

Any more MetaCRS members who can +1 this? We've had three release candidates, the packagers are happy with it, and it is mostly a bug fix release.

Howard,

How can I contribute to add formulae on http://proj4.org/projections/
index.html ?

As part of the exchange on spatialreference mailing list, I was about to
check formulae on wikipedia. I think it will be valuable to share it on
projections/index.html.

Regards,
Julien.

The intention right now is for those project pages to document proj4 projection methods as they are implemented. The intention is when a new projection method is added to Proj4, such as when +proj=times was just added this past release, a new page will be added there with all relevant information, math, and pointers.

I've checked
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equirectangular_projection
and the French page was a bit better as the formula take into account
lamba_0, but proj4 thus the us page did not !.


I am about to pull request the formula in eqc.rst as a first test :
https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/pull/411
Let me know if something is wrong.
(note the big fast forward cos my fork was a bit away from the latests
proj4 commit).


I need to sleep a bit !

Julien.

I did a very quick review and was satisfied with results.

+1 to release, FrankW.

Thanks for the great work!

Declaring this passed with +1 from Charles and Frank.

I have copied RC3 to the standard download location of

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.3.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.3.tar.gz.md5
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.3.zip
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-4.9.3.zip.md5

and updated http://proj4.org/download.html with its location.

See you next year!

Periodic releases are critical to the long term health of projects such as Proj.4. Proj.4 is currently on an "annual" release cycle, usually corresponding on or near the FOSS4G conference, and we look to keep with that pace unless some critical issue is identified.

Can you also promote proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 to final?

Let's not wait another year.

I didn't notice before, but NEWS has not updates.  Also on the download
page the notes link is to the 4.9.2 announcement.

Is it fair that 4.9.3 is just bug fixes (which is important, but from
the viewpoint of users, updating is a non-event and should just be
done)?

4.9.3 is not entirely just bugfixes, RC3 introduced the Times projection
(PJ_times) by Kristian Evers.

FYI, I have been able to make contact with Gerald's son in regards to access to his original latex documentation sources. He doesn't have them accessible at the moment, but he is planning to look through some of Gerald's materials for them in a month or so when he visits his parent's home.

I don't think there has ever been a write-up of Gerald's contributions for public consumption. I would like to lead such an effort. If you have anecdotes of working with Gerald, stories of how impactful his software has been in your career, or other interesting items, please privately send them to me. I will collate them into an article and find an outlet for it.

Thanks,

Howard

Looking at the github milestone page for 4.9.3 [0] you can see that there's a bit more than just bug fixes. 
A few more projections has been added (Patterson, Natural Earth II, Compact Miller, MISR SOM).
The default UTM projection is now etmerc. A bunch of stuff has been added with regards to tests, but that is probably not of interest for the general user.

I guess we need to compile a proper list of what's new and put in NEWS before releasing?

It's too late, but adding NEWS on trunk would be great.

From a user POV, bugfixes and new projections are not that big a deal,
since they don't in theroy change anything that was already right.

Changing UTM to etmerc is a more significant change.  (Not objecting in
the least; it's just quite notable.)   So I think we have:


4.9.3 Release Notes
-------------------

 o UTM now uses etmerc, following NGA recommendations.  Tests adjusted
   for tiny changes in values.

 o new projections: Times, Natural Earth II, Compact Miller, Patterson
   Cylindrical, and inverse for Hammer and Eckert-Greifendorff.

 o runtime self tests are now opt-in instead of opt-out

 o math constants moved to projects.h

 o bugfixes

 o New (optional) runtime self tests added to proj

All,

proj-datumgrid-1.6RC1 has been in use for three years. I propose we promote it to final.

All,

I have spend a few hours documenting the Mercator projection in the hopes that it can serve as a template for the rest of the projections that still need to be documented.

http://proj4.org/projections/merc.html

This is just my first initial thoughts on how to document a projection.
I've divided the page into a few sections:

- A short introduction
- A table with a few key facts
- Plot(s)
- Usage/examples
- Underlying math
- References

I would like to hear your thought on this. Is this a sufficient level of documentation? Did I leave out something obvious (in general terms, not specific to the Mercator projection)? Do you like the general format?

Kris,

Looks good !

What about documenting the false easting x_0, false northing y_0 parameters ? 
But as those ones apply for all projections since they are applied in the 
generic code of pj_fwd/pj_inv, they should perhaps be documented in a general 
page. The same applies for the central meridian (lon_0).

Regarding Mercator, proj actually supports 2 forms, the one with +lat_ts 
(Mercator_2SP) and the one with the scale factor +k_0 (Mercator_1SP)
I found this with libgeotiff projection catalog, which might be a useful 
resource (the original URL is defunct since a few days, hence this wayback 
machine URL) :

I think the generic parameters like false easting/northing should be documented elsewhere. 
In fact they already are on http://proj4.org/parameters.html although that page could use some more work.

Yes, you are absolutely right about the +k_0 and +lat_ts options!

There's a whopping difference between pure projection parameter definitions and large-scale mapping GRID parameters.  e.g., False Northing South of False Origin, etc. which is found in several nations of North Africa.  Similar esoterica occur worldwide.  I recommend separating the two.  Novices do not need to be confronted with exquisite parameters to "fill-in the blanks.
Remember K.I.S.S.

I think it looks great, with the greatest benefit being everything about it finally in one place. I might only add links to Wikipedia, Wolfram, and/or Wherever as a "further reading" section. Maybe we just need Snyder's book in Sphinx format ;)

Sphinx sure does make for some pretty documentation when you put in the effort. I will work through automated PDF generation of the website in addition to the currently existing HTML. We have this for PDAL and MapServer sites as well, and we have found it very valuable for snapshotting documentation in conjunction with releases.

Good point, Howard. I've added a "Further reading" section now.

Regarding Snyder's book. It's published by the USGS and therefore presumably in the public domain. Are we allowed to use his text directly in the documentation? Filling out the blanks would be a lot faster if that's the case :)

I am not too familiar with the Sphinx ecosystem. Is it possible to use intelligent bibliography like in LaTeX? For now I have just hard-coded the references but in a PDF it would look a lot better if there was a proper bibliography at the end of the document. It's also a lot easier to manage I guess.

We will have made great progress if we get proj's documentations modernized...

If Frank has any notes or tools about how datumgrid was prepared, it would be helpful to allows to continue to release grid sets.

I have made an attempt to implement your template for Hatano http://proj4.org/projections/hatano.html

I also constructed a References page and updated your Mercator page with those references. A full collection of the relevant references will be helpful to bring the website together. If anyone has links or copies of PDFs other than those in the "old" section of the docs https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/tree/master/docs/old please let me know and we'll be happy to add them to corpus.

Any chance to get the content from remotesensing.org into the new pages 
with least effort?

I saved some of them to my local disc, but not all.

Message-ID: <00F9E64B563E7C45818C85C1B7FCC726015F750010@SFMB02.exponent.com>

Hi all, 

I'm new to the list. I just finished an Excel API wrapper for 
pj_transform(), which was surprisingly straightforward thanks to the 
easy build with NMAKE and simple API (I can't say enough good things 
about this library). Here's the GitHub page with some basic 
documentation: 

<https://github.com/jbuonagurio/proj.xll> 

I started this a couple years ago actually, but just recently changed it 
to use the native Excel C API and added some other improvements like the 
EPSG() function to return proj.4 strings from a giant switch statement 
(for single file deployment / separate folder and PROJ_LIB not 
required). 

I have a few improvements planned, but please let me know if you have 
any suggestions or feedback: 

- create an installer and chm help file
- test against GIGS
- use pj_is_latlong() so you don't have to use radians 

-----

On a somewhat unrelated note, I also started working on a library 
version of NGS HTDP, and a simple wrapper to use it in R: 

<https://github.com/jbuonagurio/RHTDP> 

The library isn't quite ready for prime time just yet - need to make a 
proper C binding with iso_c_binding (only works with GCC at the moment), 
add the required explicit interfaces and other cleanup. At this point 
the F77 code is mostly unmodified. 

I know you have the crs2crs2grid.py utility to generate HTDP grids 
between specific epochs, but I think it would be cool to embed HTDP in 
such a way that you can provide epoch dates as parameters in the proj.4 
string. Would probably take quite a bit of work to do this 'cleanly' 
though.

Thanks for the great software, 

John Buonagurio

Hi John,

Very cool indeed. I know of at least one that will find this useful. I've added a link to you github repo on the wiki [0]. Eventually I'll get round to putting on the website as well.

Your work on HTDP sounds interesting as well. I'll have to give it a closer look later. I wonder if there's an overlap between your work and the "transformation pipelines" [1] that Thomas are working on.

Hi,

I've updated the "transformations" table within the srs.db which ships with proj4 for QGIS (Mapserver, Grass et al) so that it now correctly uses OSTN15 (EPSG 7709).

This has been tested, I even showed it working to Ordnance Survey on the 24th Sept.

My question is, how do I move this forward so that it is implemented within the Proj4 in the future?

I can provide links to the updated srs.db and the OSTN15 gsb file if necessary.

Regards,

Nicholas Duggan FRGS Cgeog(GIS) MRi

I'm just double-checking. Is it the original, published NTv2 file, OSTN15_NTv2.gsb? Because the original one gives offsets from ETRS89 to OSGB36. That's opposite what EPSG::7709 says which has the source as OSGB36 and the target as ETRS89. I believe OS plans to publish 2 NTv2 files, one in each 'direction.' EPSG is waiting for OS before they decide on whether the current coordinate operations need to be modified or replaced.

One reason for publishing both is for software that assumes all transformations are from the local/older GeoCRS to the more general/newer GeoCRS.

So, you might want to hold off for a little while to see what happens.

Hi Melita,

Having spoken with Ordnance Survey and spent the day with them on Friday, there is no current plan to release 2 versions of the NTv2 file, this is under discussion with EPSG and will require some further work.

The current (working) version works fine with QGIS and other OSGeo distributions when used in the srs.db format as the software recognises the direction of the transformation and translates accordingly, please see my blog to see how to implement this and verify.

I understand that there is an issue with the command line format Proj as describing the reverse direction is problematic due to the library only reading from projected to geographic, this is not an issue with the transformation, which works perfectly.

Nick D

Try #2 to the proj mailing list now that I've actually confirmed my email
address :)

There is no rush on this.  It was just a dead code complaint by a linter,
not a failure seen with actual code.

I am trying to convert some points from rpoly to utm. I have tried typing

Hi,

PROJ.4 only supports the forward transformation (from lon/lat to projected). The inverse transformation isn't implemented unfortunately for rectangular polyconic:

<https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/src/PJ_rpoly.c#L12>

("no inv.")

Has anyone looked into this? The inverse is described in Yang/Snyder/Tobler.

I had a quick look in Yang, Snyder & Tobler and it should be fairly easy to implement the inverse projection. I've created a ticket for it: https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/issues/420

Feel free to submit a pull request!

Thanks for your response John.

Is there any way for me to convert rpoly to anything at all that is more
modern? I just need to get my coordinates into something that can be used in
a GIS software.

Thanks,
Jessica

Thanks, my thoughts as well. The calculations for this projection are very similar to the regular (American) polyconic.

I'll give it a shot - working on implementing the inverse on the sphere. Will submit via pull request.

I had a quick look in Yang, Snyder & Tobler and it should be fairly easy to implement the inverse projection. I've created a ticket for it: https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__github.com_OSGeo_proj.4_issues_420&d=DQIGaQ&c=t0wRGL5ICVzH157W8C8Wew&r=Q-Rs-yPWbL0-v_m_Ov9CS1uGraVrKdE4mvUkBfZ3rWE&m=9qi7q5QoQWxg6vZjCV32eGaFCcF3h2BpKvbInYryzts&s=kz8sB_TLq3wDwp1Gvttw4ZxIq8a-L40nxugvAoI-Lps&e= 



Feel free to submit a pull request!

It's not possible to do that accurately without an inverse transformation. PROJ.4 and GCTP[C] at least don't implement it. I'll work on it over the next few days and keep you updated.

Also, apologies to others on the list for "urldefense.proofpoint.com" links in previous message. Our email server adds these and I forgot to remove.
