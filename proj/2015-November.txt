Hello, 

basically it is always ok to switch to any calculation that is more
accurate or more formally correct ... but there should also be some kind
of a method to stay downwards compatible. At least some methods or go
arounds to stay compatible with old version should be given to users?! 

What proj4 declarations should be used to keep the old calculation in
effect?! etc..

Hello,
the EPSG-code definitions for 31256 - 31258 (MGI = Austrian date) on the master are different with spatialreference.org.:

https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/nad/epsg/
http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/31256/proj4/
http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/31257/proj4/

Could be here a bug in proj.4 EPSG database?

Thank you in advance!

If memory serves me right, you should use something like +proj=tmerc
+x_0=500000 +lon_0=...   +scale=0.9996 to invoke the Snyder algorithm
(fully analogous to what you had to do up until now to get utm using
+proj=etmerc)

To my knowledge http://spatialreference.org is rather dated (on the
respective OSGeo server I see only file timestamps older than several
years).

Alternative:
http://epsg.io/31256
etc. Does this fit better?

best.

Yes, the same as spatialreference.org with 7-point-setting. (towgs84)
But in proj.4 there is a another definition string in ./nad/epsg

The definisions are equivalent. Datum hermannskogel is hardcoded in proj.4 
source as being Bessel 1841 ellipsoid with following TOWGS84:

src/pj_datums.c:{"hermannskogel",  
"towgs84=577.326,90.129,463.919,5.137,1.474,5.297,2.4232",

The fact that you have either one or another one depends on how GDAL had been 
configured to produce the proj EPSG file, either requesting proj to do the datum 
expension, or keeping its name. But results should be identical.

$ gdaltransform -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs "+proj=longlat +ellps=bessel 
+towgs84=577.326,90.129,463.919,5.137,1.474,5.297,2.4232 +no_defs"

If the intend is to get standard CRS definitions, the official reference
would rather be http://epsg-registry.org/ (click on "Retrieve by code"
and enter 31256). The CRS given by epsg.io use an axis order different
than the one specified by the EPSG database for geographic CRS, and the
prime meridian values in their WKT presume a unit of measurement which
is different than the one specified by OGC 01-009 (which is the
specification mandated by GeoPackage) and the new ISO 19162
international standard. For "Nouvelle Triangulation Française"
geographic CRS, this difference in interpretation result in a error of
hundred of kilometres compared to standard-compliant applications.

Indeed http://spatialreference.org is out of data with respect to current the EPSG database and recent GDAL/proj.4 code that exercises it. It needs an owner. http://epsg.io is more up-to-date, but sr.org does try to be more than just the EPSG database. It also has a lot of google juice. I have a stack of emails that represent bug reports for it too for anyone who wants to step up and own it.

Hello,

why not just add a new projection called "utm2" or "newutm" or "xutm" .. 
and use it like "proj=utm2" etc. I would like more if the new utm was 
called different so that the old references would stay where they always 
been.. just to stay consistent..

Dear Janne,

I'm against given the new utm implementation a different name.  The
whole point is that a naive user can request "utm" and get the best
available implementation of the projection.

Conceivably, the old version could be made available as "oldutm" or
whatever.  But I would like to see some evidence this is really needed
given that with the standard UTM conventions for zones, we are only
talking about a ~ 0.1mm difference -- and this is also the round-trip
discrepancy in the old implementation.

For what is worth, I also don't see the point in making the old 'utm' available
under any other name for sub millimeter differences.

And there are other changes/fixes that are sometimes done in other projections
that affect computations by much larger extent, hopefully towards more correctness.
For example, the results of the aeqd projection can be very different w.r.t
older versions, when going far from the center point (and for the better since the results now round-trip)

proj 4.8.0 :

$ echo "0 -45" | cs2cs +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +to +proj=aeqd +lat_0=45 +lon_0=90 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
-5504790.57	-3840359.33 0.00

$ echo "-5504790.57 -3840359.33" | cs2cs -I +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +to +proj=aeqd +lat_0=45 +lon_0=90 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
44d36'50.801"E	0d16'23.383"S 0.000

--> completely off

proj 4.9.2

$ echo "0 -45" | cs2cs +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +to +proj=aeqd +lat_0=45 +lon_0=90 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
-10900566.43	-7663668.99 0.00

$ echo "-10900566.43 -7663668.99" | cs2cs -I +proj=longlat +datum=WGS84 +no_defs +to +proj=aeqd +lat_0=45 +lon_0=90 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
0dW	45dS 0.000

--> perfect

If people are not happy with new proj versions, by all means, they can stay with older releases,
or fork the project to fit their purposes, or ask for a refund for their license fees.

Ramona,

Long answer:
This CRS probably didn't exist in the EPSG database v8.5 that was used the 
last time the proj/GDAL derived EPSG database was generated. And I see that 
the ellipsoidal Lamber Cylindrical Equal Area projection method 9835 was also 
unknown of GDAL. I've fixed GDAL to recognize it so next time the proj/GDAL 
EPSG database is regenerated EPSG:6933 will be there.

Short answer:

use "+proj=cea +lon_0=0 +lat_ts=30 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs" 
instead of EPSG:6933 in the meantime.

Best regards,

Even

Are EPSG:6931 and EPSG:6932 supported as well?

The EASE-Grid Data website [1] indicates they are supported by GDAL
with correct version of PROJ.4 (4.8.0), but I can only get the
original EASE-Grid codes working with gdalsrsinfo / ImportFromEPSG.

Not with current distributed GDAL/proj EPSG database. Should come with a next 
update.

With the important note
"""
Note1: Use these ProjectedCRS Codes for EPSG Version 8.6 or later.
Note2: GDAL tools built with the correct version of PROJ4 will work on the 
EASE-Grid 2.0 projections with PROJ4 strings even if it's built with EPSG 
Codes earlier than 8.6. 
"""

So if you update the GDAL csv files or add a definition in epsg.wkt, that will 
work. It is "just" a matter of updating the database.

After my recent post about Knud Poder, I was contacted by geodesy
professor Martin Vermeer, of Aalto University, Finland, who used to
collaborate with Knud Poder. He asked med to post this follow up to
the proj mailing list. So I hereby hand over the microphone to Martin:


Yes, I recently corresponded with Poder and yes, he actively follows
the field.

Back in 1988-1992 when I was in Denmark at the National Survey &
Cadastre -- and before that, the Geodætisk Institut in Ordrup, in a
beautiful country estate --, we saw a lot of each other. He was always
ready to help and explain about the GIER computers and the BOSS
operating system. I remember entering his room, negotiating my way
through the tangible pipe tobacco smoke filling the room, to find him
sitting at his glass teletype terminal, writing code. A Unix nerd, he
too. A thick aluminum ash tray by his side, which had seen all the
mountain tops of Greenland :-)

Dr Poder was made an honorary doctor at Copenhagen University,
proposed IIRC by Carl Christian Tscherning, who died a year ago. That
was early 1990s.

Knud's life hasn't always been easy: a few years later his son Niels
suffered an internal organ failure and was left brain damaged as a
result. That was tough.

Hello,

since the difference will be in sub millimeter region .. I might also 
not to be too much worried about the change .. especially if it is also 
not much slower and clearly notified. But just to remain in some cases 
it IS VERY important to get repeatable results (even if wrong) with the 
library .. but this change could also be handled just mentioning that 
the new utm formula will change the computation so and so much. And as 
such the programmer (not the end user) should NOT apply the new library 
without testing the results (so to say "keep the old version if you need 
to be absolutely sure that the computations will be repeatable in the 
future also..")

Janne.

I seem to remember someone has already said this, but it shouldn't be 
necessary to keep an old version of PROJ.4 since all you have to do to 
keep the same formula is to reformulate the projection definition using 
+proj=tmerc instead of +proj=utm. The old +proj=tmerc formula will still 
be available in new versions of PROJ.4 in the future.

It would probably be a good idea for the release notes for the new 
version to make this clear, to avoid undue alarm, and to explain that 
projection definitions that use +proj=tmerc will give the same results 
in both previous and future releases.

Message-ID: <CAK6pVBXMXwgCqK8v1a6fMwUVxvyTOqP-wJJkRMsp5a-5uQ5t4g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all

I am new to both lists (proj and metacrs) so my apologies for
cross-posting, I am not quite sure where my question belongs.

I am working in the beautiful country of Kyrgyzstan, which happens to have
developed a new national geodetic framework. One of the outputs is a
coordinate system (Kyrg06), divided in 5 zones.

As far as I know, this coordinate system is not yet available in any common
library / software and is neither in the EPSG list.

Is there any standard process to get a sort of international recognition?
This system has been approved by the government and thus has a legal
validity in this country. But it will always be difficult to convince
people to use it as long as it's not readily available in the common
software (and thus in the underlying libraries). As a result, many GIS
users end up working with UTM or other not-so-optimal.

Thanks a lot in advance for your hints and advice on this matter

Cheers

Stéphane

There's no such thing as "automatic" ;-) But if it is included in the EPSG 
database then it should be available in proj.4/GDAL/libgeotiff when the next 
resynchronization with the EPSG database is done

On a related matter, I note that Frank Warmerdan has blogged on the 180 issue...http://fwarmerdam.blogspot.co.nz/2010/02/world-mapping.html
Coming from New Zealand, where this is a regular issue, is there any way the standard Proj CRS parameter lists could include 180-safe versions with the +over parameter as well as standard versions of at least the common projections spanning 180?
It could not be done with EPSG codes, as this is not actually a projection issue (the projection is the same- just the X coord space changes), but could perhaps be done within the Proj list, in a way which provides a few alternatives to facilitate plotting data spanning 180.

That's kind of what I meant with "automatic" :-) that the newest version of
EPSG is used when a new version of Proj4 is released

So I got my answer, thanks boh of you!

Continuing this thread on a related, but also orthogonal subject:

I would like to add support for old Danish systems to proj4.

Official, and public available, procedures exist for transforming these
systems to and from UTM/ETRS89. The problem is that the transformations are
given as high order polynomial coefficients, and a corresponding
implementation of a 2D Horner's scheme for high precision evaluation.

I suppose my first step would be to implement the Horner code in the proj4
code tree, and then perhaps adding the coefficients for the individual
transformations as external files, preferably in a widely recognized file
format, along with the grid shift files already used by proj. Perhaps then
either introducing a new qualifier for specifying the specific system or
overloading the +zone=... qualifier, essentially aiming at a proj syntax in
the general direction of:

proj +proj=horner +zone=s34j

or similar.

The reason we want to do this is that the official transformations
(included in out trlib software available over at
https://bitbucket.org/KMS/trlib) are used by geospatial software from
numerous providers, but given the ubiquity of proj, most users probably
already include proj in their code bases, hence making supporting old
Danish systems much easier - to some degree even automatically
accomplishable.

My colleagues and I are still just starting these considerations, so any
advice, thoughts and warnings would be most welcome.

Best regards
