Subject: [Proj] The area of a rhumb line polygon
Message-ID: <5490304B.9090703@sri.com>

The calculation of the area of a geodesic polygon has been included in
GeographicLib since v1.4 (2010-09).

In the latest version v1.39, I've also included the equivalent
calculation when the edges of the polygon are rhumb lines.  The
formulation is given in

   http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/rhumb.html#rhumbarea

and the online planimeter

   http://geographiclib.sf.net/cgi-bin/Planimeter

implements this area calculation.  I've also worked out the area when
the edges are great ellipses.  For the formulation, see

   http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/greatellipse.html#gearea

An implementation is included in the Matlab package

   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47898

Comments are welcome.

Thanks for the Matlab versions, Charles.  Why R2014b?  (I'm still running 
R2014a, but planning an upgrade to R2015a, which will include the new World 
Magnetic Model.)

Only the toolbox version requires R2014b.  The Matlab release I used was
R2013a and it works with Octave too.  Just click on "Download Zip".

GeographicLib already works with the World Magnetic Model 2015.  You can
download the model from

   https://sf.net/projects/geographiclib/files/magnetic-distrib/

and you are good to go.  Just specify "-n wmm2015" to the MagneticField
utility.  (This will be the default for GeographicLib 1.40 which I will
be releasing later this week.)

While on the subject of great ellipses, I provide a critique of some
papers which advocate great ellipses for the purposes of navigation at

Hi,

I just want to call your attention that GMT has the CM4 magnetic model,  
which the only one that provides an estimate of the magnetic daily  
variation, making it the best (IMO) model to use.

Subject: [Proj] convert latlon to UTM without knowing the zone beforehand
Message-ID: <CABa=8QrTvkAyUsb2vu6echgQwvzhAEEmPKUTx0LGHPLCAphh=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I need to convert any pairs of geographic coordinates (latlon) into UTM.
This needs to run automatically so that I need an automatic tool to tell
for any pairs which UTM zone it belongs to before converting. Of course I
can encode in my script all possible cases, but before reinventing the
wheel i wanted to ask if there is such tool already within proj.4 library.

Thank you in advance

The GeoConvert utility from GeographicLib might serve your needs.  For
example:

$ echo 33.3N 44.4E | GeoConvert -u -p 3
38n 444140.545 3684706.356

Here is the man page

   http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/html/GeoConvert.1.html

Visit

   http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/GeoConvert

to try it out.  This page also has a link for downloading GeographicLib.

Subject: [Proj] Rhumb lines and Mercator on a triaxial ellipsoid
Message-ID: <549588D0.7080603@sri.com>

It is well known that a rhumb line arrives at a pole in a finite
distance after encircling the pole infinitely many times.  Craig Rollins
recently asked me what heading a rhumb line has *after* passing through
the pole.

One way of answering this is to consider a rhumb line on a triaxial
ellipsoid and to take the limit as the two large axes approach one
another.  The (somewhat surprising) result is that the heading of the
rhumb line is reversed.  E.g., if the initial heading is NE, the heading
after passing through the pole is SW.

This got me to thinking about the Mercator projection on a triaxial
ellipsoid.  This was given by Jacobi in 1843, see section 28 of

   https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/440645889

The integrals that Jacobi gives can be written in terms of elliptic
integrals, see

   https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-32618-9_17
   http://geographiclib.sf.net/html/triaxial.html#triaxial-conformal

Finally, Jacobi has an interesting take on Gauss' work on conformal
projections (excerpted from Balagangadharan's translation):

   "Among the different ways of representing a curved surface on a plane,
   as is necessary for a map, one prefers, above all, the method of
   projection in which infinitely small elements remain similar.  In the
   preceding century Lambert had been concerned with various aspects of
   this projection, of which one can learn in detail from his
   contributions to mathematics.  Because of these, Lambert's colleague
   at that time, Lagrange, was induced to undertake an investigation from
   the same standpoint and gave the solution completely for all surfaces
   of revolution.  The Copenhagen Academy which later announced a prize
   for the solution of this problem for all curved surfaces awarded it to
   the treatise sent in by Gauss.  In this, Lagrange's work, to which
   only little had to be added, finds no mention."

Nice.  A meridian is a limiting case of a rhumb line.  It's not at all 
surprising that a meridian undergoes a N/S reversal passing through a pole. 
E/W reversal in the general case is not so intuitive, but Fermat's spiral is 
a template for that.  -Noel

So, does this mean that if I travel along a rhumb line, and reach a pole after a finite distance, and continue the same distance beyond the pole, I would end up at my original latitude but at the opposite (antipodal) meridian?
       That sounds fairly intuitive, but I always thought it was undefined how to continue a rhumb line beyond a pole, due to the infinite number of encirclings around the pole. 

Interesting.

The longitude is undefined.  You may end up retracing your path.

I've updated my notes on Jacobi's conformal projection of a triaxial
ellipsoid; see

   http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/1.41/jacobi.html

New stuff:

* the limits, ellipsoid of revolution and sphere, are easily obtained;

* the Guyou projection (and hence the Peirce quincuncial projection) are
   special cases of Jacobi's projection (which predates both of these);

* Jacobi + Guyou can be used to map a triaxial ellipsoid conformally
   onto a sphere.
