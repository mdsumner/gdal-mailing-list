Thanks Jeff!
The build is failing. I created a PR over your branch removing a custom
transformation 'ETRS89 to Alicante height' that is already in EPSG db as
EPSG:9410 (added recently). I hope it fixes the problem.

Even, I see that the migration to EPSG v10 is not easy. If I can help
somehow, contact me directly. However I am not an expert in databases
neither in EPSG data itself.

Cheers

Subject: [PROJ] Bug in unit conversion using cs2cs and transformations from
 registries?
Message-ID: <3005F0FD58AE03439837685371FBCB71FDFD709B@mailex1.ign.fr>

Dear all,

I apologize if this problem is known or if I don't use the command cs2cs correctly. I have experimented a unit conversion problem when transforming coordinates from WGS84 geographic coordinate system to NTF geographic (Paris meridian) coordinate system using cs2cs.

Using cs2cs:
------------
version 7.1.0
- $ echo 43.97942110 5.77338693  0.0 | cs2cs EPSG:4326 IGNF:NTFP  -f %.8f
Result: 3.43669113    43.97940959 0.00000000
The right result (IGN code) is: 3.81854570 48.86601066
Here the angle unit conversion is missing. Indeed:
echo 3.43669113      43.97940959 | cct -d 10 +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=grad
Result: 3.8185457000  48.8660106556           inf           inf

Proposed proj string from projinfo:
-----------------------------------
If launched, the proj string proposed by the following command "projinfo -s EPSG:4326 -t IGNF:NTFP" gives the right result in the right unit.
echo 43.97942110 5.77338693 0.0 | cct -d 8 +proj=pipeline +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1 +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad +step +proj=push +v_3 +step +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84 +step +proj=helmert +x=168 +y=60 +z=-320 +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=clrk80ign +step +proj=pop +v_3 +step +proj=longlat +ellps=clrk80ign +pm=paris +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=grad
Result: 3.81854570    48.86601066    0.00000000           inf

I hope that it helps. Do I use the cs2cs command in the right way?

Thank you,
Best regards,

- Xavier

PS: using cs2cs in version 6.3.2, I have also faced coordinate order problem. But I guess it is a known result
The cs2cs command does not recognize the coordinate order:
- $ echo 43.97942110 5.77338693 0.0 | cs2cs +init=EPSG:4326 +to +init=IGNF:NTFP  -f %.8f
Result: 41.64152849     5.77099039 0.00000000
This is the wrong result. When putting the longitude first:
- $ echo 5.77338693 43.97942110 0.0 | cs2cs +init=EPSG:4326 +to +init=IGNF:NTFP  -f %.8f
I got 3.43669113      43.97940959 0.00000000
The same unit conversion problem as in new version 7.3.1

For a geographic CRS, cs2cs will always output (and expect input) geographic coordinates in 
decimal degrees, whatever the unit of the coordinate system. This is a legacy behaviour, from 
a time where CRS definitions in catalogs didn't include the unit.

Yes, here this is another behaviour when using +init=EPSG:XXX or +init=IGNF:XXXX you use 
the legacy behaviour that wasn't compliant with the axis order of the authority, and assumed 
longitude, latitude for geographic CRS. When using EPSG:XXXX or IGNF:XXXX instead, the 
axis order is respected.

Perhaps for the EPSG:XXX or IGNF:XXXX syntax we should also use the unit of the coordinate 
systems instead of always degrees, but this mostly affects only those NTF based systems...

You have to use cct with the PROJ pipeline emitted by projinfo to control precisely which 
transformation you want to use

Message-ID: <EC26E94B-4056-4AF9-A38B-4FDD4A681C58@truwayllc.com>

Hello,

I just compiled proj 7.1.0 on my machine and the examples I‚Äôve tried from the Proj website seem to work. I‚Äôm trying to convert from Lat/Long coordinates to State Plane zone 4302 (Central Utah). After a bit of searching I found what appears to be the correct syntax to enter the state plane zone "+nad83:4302‚Äù. I tried starting with a simplified set of arguments as follows...


$ echo -111.4342412778 40.6680408972 | proj +proj=utm +nad83:4302 +ellps=WGS84
-5286420.10	12245588.21

The expected result (from a tie sheet) is 505560.312 2259209.082

If I Try the same syntax to translate to UTM zone 12 I get a more reasonable result

$ echo -111.4342412778 40.6680408972 | proj +proj=utm +zone=12 +ellps=WGS84
463296.98	4501998.16

What am I doing wrong here?

I would be particularly interested in seeing how to do this with the more modern PROJ pipeline syntax.

Wayne,

I am not that familiar with the state plane coordinate reference systems but I do know my way around PROJ.
One obvious mistake you are making is the ‚Äú+nad83:4302‚Äù. That is not a valid parameter (proj ignore
parameters it doesn‚Äôt recognize). What you are looking for is ‚Äú+init=nad83:4302‚Äù:

$ echo -111.4342412778 40.6680408972 | proj +init=nad83:4302
505560.31       2259209.08

The use of +init-based CRS-descriptions is deprecated though. In modern PROJ this would done with cs2cs
using CRS definitions from the EPSG registry (or the like). I only looked briefly for the correct EPSG-code to
use but couldn‚Äôt find one that matches. Someone more familiar with the state plane system can probably
do that easily.

projinfo will tell you have to set up the same transformation using the fully expanded projstring:

$ projinfo +init=nad83:4302
PROJ string:
+proj=lcc +datum=NAD83 +lon_0=-111d30 +lat_1=40d39 +lat_2=39d1 +lat_0=38d20 +x_0=500000 +y_0=2000000 +no_defs

WKT2:2019 string:
CONVERSION["PROJ-based coordinate operation",
    METHOD["PROJ-based operation method: proj=lcc datum=NAD83 lon_0=-111d30 lat_1=40d39 lat_2=39d1 lat_0=38d20 x_0=500000 y_0=2000000 no_defs"]]

In this case it is simply a projection, so you don‚Äôt need a pipeline to express this transformation.

Hi Wayne,

I am not very familiar with PROJ pipeline syntax. I am more familiar with
this other one:
echo 40.6680408972 -111.4342412778 | PROJ_LIB=../data/ ./cs2cs EPSG:4326
ESRI:102343
that returns what you expect: 505560.31 2259209.08
See that I am using cs2cs, and the input is lat-long

For more information about ESRI:102343
("NAD_1983_HARN_StatePlane_Utah_Central_FIPS_4302") you can run
PROJ_LIB=../data/ ./projinfo ESRI:102343

Maybe it helps you.
Cheers

US State plane systems today are (almost always?  always?) projections
of NAD83.  Some states have multiple zones.  Typical projections are TM
and Lambert Conformal Conic (LCC), typically for NS and EW states or
chunks.  Note that while there are 6-degree-wide standard UTM zones
(that's the U in UTM, universal) state plane TM systems are not
necessarily UTM, and I think typically aren't.

4302 I think is a FIPS code, not an EPSG or ESRI code, and thus won't
show up in proj.  It looks like LCC.

A major wrinkle, probably in the past, is that there were state plane
systems that are projections of NAD27.

Another wrinkle is the varying realizations of NAD83, but I hope you are
in "NAD83(2011) epoch 2010.0".

The other wrinkle is that state plane systems are varyingly ins ft, ftUS, m.

It looks like central Utah zone is:
  http://epsg.io/2850

so you need to

  be clear on which state plan: NAD27 vs NAD83, ft vs m
  be clear on datum of source coordinates

and then

   find the epsg code for your source data (NAD83?)
   find the code for state plane, maybe EPSG:2850 code
   use cs2cs


Kristian is I think right that the state plane is only a projection, but
it's then true that to interpret coordinates in state plane you need an
associated datum.

If your source data is WGS84, that's messier.   You can:

  decide to be ok with the sort-of-true not-really-true notion that it's
  equal to NAD83, if you don't care about a meter or maybe 2.

  find out which WGS84 it really is, and if modern, label it ITRF2014,
  which will cause proj to transform it.  This is tricky business and
  you may want to ask your state geodetic advisor, if you really have
  this situation and really care about a meter, and don't already
  understand all of this

I learned something interesting from Kristian's reply (as usual!):
Apparently nad83:4302 is recognized as meaning the projection only, and
I'm not clear if it binds to datum and if so which of the NAD83 flavors.

Thanks everyone for your help. That got me going. As Greg pointed out the State Plane system was originally created around 1927 but was updated about 1983 coinciding with the adoption of NAD83. Fortunately for me all of the data I‚Äôm working with refers to SPCS 1983 and datum is NAD83 (2011) epoch 2010.0. As Greg also mentioned the projection type for SPSC can vary. There are three projection types, Transverse Mercator, Lambert Conformal Conic and Oblique Mercator. The only zone using the Oblique Mercator is Alaska zone (5010) that covers the Aleutian Islands. In Utah, three bands of East-West extent are used and the Lambert projection is used for each zone. Our neighbor to the South, Arizona, chose to use three zones of North-South extent, and the Transverse Mercator Projection is used. The goal in all cases is to keep the grid scale correction less that one part in 10,000. For those curious about this system, here‚Äôs a link to a great resource.

Subject: [PROJ] Implementing HS2 NTV2 grid in PROJ
Message-ID: <44577f4a-8206-8ba0-1184-b0ecc2d8cd9a@atlascomputers.ie>

Hi,

 ¬†¬†¬† First post to this group and a relative novice to PROJ, beyond 
using existing transformation strings.¬† I'm looking to implement 
transformations to and from HS2 NTv2 and OSTN02 and OSTN15, and also 
matching vertical shifts, using Proj (current v7 build, working in C++), 
see 
https://www.thepwi.org/technical_hub/presentations_for_tech_hub/190709_summer_nr_tech/07_hs2_engineering_coordinate_systems__j_turner 
for a description of the HS2 NTv2 grid which replaces the HS2 Snakegrid 
implementation.¬† HS2 grid is registered under EPSG:9300: 
https://epsg.org/crs_9300/HS2-Survey-Grid.html 
<https://epsg.org/crs_9300/HS2-Survey-Grid.html?sessionkey=wbkmhx76b2> 
And the compound CRS is registered under EPSG:9306: 
https://epsg.org/crs_9306/HS2-Survey-Grid-HS2-VRF-height.html 
<https://epsg.org/crs_9306/HS2-Survey-Grid-HS2-VRF-height.html?sessionkey=oryxvd4m1b>

I have the NTv2 GSB files for HS2 NTv2 (HS2TN15_NTv2.gsb and 
HS2TN02_NTv2.gsb) and will be transforming between 3d coordinates, where 
from my understanding height and grid position will be dealt with 
separately.¬† I also have vertical shift files in the format lat, long, 
height which I'm guessing I'll need to convert to a GTX file as 
described here; https://vdatum.noaa.gov/docs/gtx_info.html Not sure 
whether PROJ uses ASCII or binary versions of the GTX file, but no 
issues building either as needed.

What I'd like to achieve is a PROJ string or pipeline I can use within 
my software to perform the required transformations, i.e. OSTN02 & 
OSGM02 and OSTN15 & OSGM15 to HS2 survey grid plus VRF and back again.

While I can probably work my way through this, as someone new using GSB 
and GTX files in PROJ, any help or suggestions would be greatly 
appreciated.¬† I was hoping it would be available in epsg.io but it seems 
not as yet,

Shane

Message-ID: <mailman.36.1597750927.17181.proj@lists.osgeo.org>

Hi,

I have a problem with reprojecting a global GeoJSON file with a hole over Canada from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3978 (Canada Atlas Lambert).

You can see my GeoJSON below in this email. The global extent is x=-180,180 and y=-90,90

I tried using:

  *   MapServer (7.4.4)
     *   I tried to serve the layer as WMS and display it in QGIS
     *   Result: I expected the GeoJSON to be automatically cut to the EPSG:3978 extent and show the hole over Canada, but instead, the hole was displayed as the features on the map whitout the global extent.
  *   Opening raw GeoJSON directly in QGIS (3.15.0-Master, GDAL 3.2.0dev, PROJ 7.2.0)
     *   same results as MapServer in WMS
  *   ogr2ogr (GDAL 3.0.4)
     *   I tried to reproject the GeoJSON from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:3978
     *   Result: the reprojection failed, my feature is empty
        *   ogr2ogr -f "GeoJSON" -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:3978 18-3978.geojson 17-4326.geojson
ERROR 1: Full reprojection failed, but partial is possible if you define OGR_ENABLE_PARTIAL_REPROJECTION configuration option to TRUE
ERROR 1: Failed to reproject feature 0 (geometry probably out of source or destination SRS).
ERROR 1: Terminating translation prematurely after failed
translation of layer 17-4326 (use -skipfailures to skip errors)
  *   OpenLayers and the proj4 lib (proj4js/2.6.2/proj4.js)
     *   Here is an example reprojecting the GeoJSON to EPSG:3978: https://codepen.io/rousseaulambertlp/pen/wvGGBXd
        *   The OSM base map is reprojected corretly, but the GeoJSON is simply not displayed
     *   Here is the same code, but using a non global GeoJSON with a hole, which works: https://codepen.io/rousseaulambertlp/pen/YzqWVBZ
     *   But I see that a global WMS layer served from MapServer, works fine in this projection: https://codepen.io/rousseaulambertlp/pen/MWyeogM

My guess is these behaviors are caused by the proj library giving I have issues in all the examples above ?

So I wanted to know if this is expected behavior, giving I'm trying to display a global features on a projection with a smaller extent ? Or is this is bug (especially the inverted feature in QGIS) ?

Any idea of work around other then clipping the data to the EPSG:3978 extent ?

Thanks

LP

Here is the GeoJSON I used for example:

{
  "type": "FeatureCollection",
  "crs": {
    "type": "name",
    "properties": {
      "name": "EPSG:4326"
    }

     "properties": {

            [-70, 60],

I  haven't digged very deep into this but I can identify at least two things that seem problematic to me.

EPSG:3978 is only defined in Canada. It is based on NAD83, so expecting a global dataset to be transformed to that CRS is asking a bit much.

> The OSM base map is reprojected corretly, but the GeoJSON is simply not displayed

Is it though? I see two occurrences of India and as far as I am aware only one exist in real life.

I would try to find a CRS that is better suited for your particular use case.

Louis-Philippe,

The issue is that points at lat=-90 projected to EPSG:3978 go to infinity, which causes the 
reprojection issue of the whole world

You might want to add to your ogr2ogr commandline a clipping of the source to the 
northerm hemisphere, before reprojecting with:

-clipsrc -180 0 180 90


-clipsrc -180 -89.999 180 90  would also work. You really want to avoid -90

Hi Kristian,

I was wondering if you intended to do a new release of PROJ-data as 
well ? There's nothing critical, but the geoid file for Canary Island 
and the Brazillian grids, referenced in the updated database of 7.1.1, 
have been added in PROJ-data since 1.1.0.

I agree. Also a nice opportunity to promote the CDN and projsync a bit.

Yes, it is a bit of gray area. I am honestly not sure what is the best approach. It is probably not that important, I can‚Äôt recall anyone questioning the way we do this.

It's probably fine as long as there is no risk of regressions in
dependent projects.

It would be somewhat unacceptable if e.g. pyproj or gdal fail to build
due to a PROJ patch release.

Kind Regards,

Bas

When we had the CDN discussion, it was said to be an option. This turns
it into a requirement.  That's why I have always been unhappy about the
CDN world and attitude; it is not just an easy way to get bits you could
have obtained in a package, usable in an off-net machine.  (In all
seriousness, I once ran a network of over 50 machines, not connected to
the Internet.)

 I think there should be a data file release to go with, even though I
get it that the data files and the proj code aren't all that linked.

(I am not bothered about the semver issues.)

I second these sentiments -- please don't let the offline packages
become an afterthought! The CDN is fantastic for some use cases, but
for others it's just not an option.

Thanks for dealing with this.

It might be that proj-dat and proj shouldn't be coupled.  I'd say that
anytime people want to give advice like "use the CDN; the most recent
data file is old" then a data release is in order.

Eventually, we may want to revisit this on the packaging side, having
multiple separate packages for various pieces.   As it is I still need
to create a proj-data package, as my draft proj 7.x packge doesn't have
data, and data really should be optional in the 7+ world.
