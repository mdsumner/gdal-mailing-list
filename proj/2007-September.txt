???? Your answer is certainly off-topic... I am not asking how to execute

Ervin,

I think people are unclear on how you are running your PROJ.4 operations.
If you are running cs2cs as a shell command from ASP.NET then this is
very pertinent since the easiest way of affecting the environment for
that command is to run a .BAT file that sets the environment variable locally
and then runs cs2cs.

Of course, you may not be running cs2cs from your application, but nevertheless
the answer was an attempt, with the information available, to answer your
specific requirement.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <46DD85F7.7050304@meteorage.com>

Hello

New in this list.
We are changing our own projection functions for a standard tool, 
libproj4, on Sun Sparc Solaris 10.
We project (latitude=45, longitude=0) to a Lambert conic conform 
projection called "extended Lamber II" used in France.
Our program gives (x=415728.737817, y=2002668.173285), which is very 
close to the result of the National Geograpgic Institute.
The "proj" command (with correct projection parameters):
echo 0 45 | proj +proj=lcc +lon_0=2.3372917 +lat_0=46.8 +lat_2=45.8989 
+lat_1=47.696 +x_0=600000 +y_0=2200000 +ellps=clrk80
gives:
415663.74       2002665.67
We are not very far on Y axis but 65 meter away on X axis.
If I specify the XYZ offset between WGS84 and NTF (dx=-168, dy=-60, 
dz=320) with option +towgs84
the command:
echo 0 45 | proj +proj=lcc +lon_0=2.3372917 +lat_0=46.8 +lat_2=45.8989 
+lat_1=47.696 +x_0=600000 +y_0=2200000 +ellps=clrk80 
+towgs84=-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0
gives exatly the same result
415663.74       2002665.67
as if the option +towgs84 is not used.

Where could be the mistake?
Is there an other way to specify the translation?
Thanks
Herve

Herve,

Gerald's libproj4 does not do datum shifts, by design.

The "proj" command also does not do datum shifts, only reprojection
on the same datum.

You can use the PROJ.4 cs2cs command to do the transformation
(equivelent to the pj_transform() API call).

eg.

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 \
   +to +proj=lcc +lon_0=2.3372917 +lat_0=46.8 +lat_2=45.8989 \
       +lat_1=47.696 +x_0=600000 +y_0=2200000 +ellps=clrk80 \
       +towgs84=-168,-60,320,0,0,0,0

I get 415723.87       2002668.31 as a result with this command.

Best regards,

Great!
It remains 5 meters of difference but this is acceptable for a lightning 
location system.

Subject: [Proj] European GIS Code Sprint
Message-ID: <20070906121854.7cca0c4d@moovida>

Dear friends, dear colleagues,

we would like to raise to you all the following proposal of an European
FOSS-GIS developers meeting by the end of November (kind of follow-up
of the Canadian Code Sprint in September).

The event is the 'European GIS Code Sprint' organized as a post-event
of the SFScon 2007 held in Merano, Italy.

Planned Dates are: 
* 16-17 Nov 2007: South Tyrol Free Software Conference 2007
    (http://www.sfscon.it/)
* 18 Nov 2007 (Sunday): Outdoor GIS data collection for Free data set
    (somewhere in South Tyrol)
* 19-21 Nov 2007: GIS Code Sprint

The organisation of the event would be made by the Free Software Center
in Bolzano.

The Sprint would mainly have the aim to bring different projects to
know each other and build up some standard interaction, let the teams
of each project meet, discuss, design and code together fulltime and
non-remotely for a few days, and obviously also do some bugfixing. Also
we would invite power users in order to work on documentation,
translation and even minor issues.

In parallel, there would be the desire to collaborate on the creation of
a free dataset by wandering in an ordered way through a defined region
of the south tirol with GPS. The dataset should contain as many data as
possible, as for example the dataset of the grassbook does. Moreover,
climatic and hydrologic/hydraulic data should be integrated in order to
support different analyses.

Time is rather short and we would like to understand how much interest
there is in such an event and more or less how many developer would
like to attend. 

We feel that there is a huge need for a developer meeting that could
bring together different projects, that really need to interact if they
want to have a glorious future.

Please give us possibly soon a feedback by *adding yourself* on the WIKI
page created for the event: 
http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/European_GIS_Code_Sprint

Warmest regards,

Andrea Antonello

I have now been looking at this again and my findings are that the program
cs2cs is working correct while using gdal in a c# enviroment gives
problems. Without the use3 of no_uoff and rot_conv both programs gives the
 same result:
** cs2cs
cs2cs +proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs +to +proj=omerc +
lat_0=4 +lonc=102.25 +alpha=323.0257964666666 +k=0.99984 +x_0=804671
+y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs
103.64025987222223 1.827764875
959373.97       -240050.80 0.000

**gdal
inn = inpGDM2000.ImportFromProj4("+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs  <>");
out = outRSO.ImportFromProj4("+proj=omerc +lat_0=4 +lonc=102.25
+alpha=323.0257964666666 +k=0.99984 +x_0=804671 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80
+units=m +no_defs <>")
959373.969 -240050.800

with no_uoff and rot_conv option
** cs2cs
cs2cs +proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs +to +proj=omerc +
lat_0=4 +lonc=102.25 +alpha=323.0257964666666 +k=0.99984 +x_0=804671
+y_0=0 +ell ps=GRS80 +units=m +no_uoff +rot_conv +no_defs
103.64025987222223 1.827764875
627096.13       202122.06 0.000

**gdal
inn = inpGDM2000.ImportFromProj4("+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +no_defs  <>");
out = outRSO.ImportFromProj4("+proj=omerc +lat_0=4 +lonc=102.25
+alpha=323.0257964666666 +k=0.99984 +x_0=804671 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80
+units=m +no_uoff +rot_conv +no_defs <>")
959373.969 -240050.800

It looks that the +no_uoff +rot_conv is not used in the gdal enviroment

Bjørn,

If you add the +wktext flag to the string passed to ImportFromProj4(),
then the OGRSpatialReference code will capture a literal copy of
the PROJ.4 parameters in the internal representation.  I think you
will need this.

Normally the coordinate system is converted to an internal (OGC WKT)
representation which does not include exotic parameters such as
+no_uoff, and +rot_conv.

You would need at least GDAL/OGR 1.4.x for this feature.

Best regards,

Subject: [Proj] Revised definitions & suggestions. Peters proj has value.
Message-ID: <BAY107-F20AF275568C62742153000A5BF0@phx.gbl>


Revised definitions and suggestions. Peters projection has value.

Linearity definitions:

I�d like to tighten my definition of linearity:

A projection has the linearity property if a map precisely constructed on 
that projection can be divided into regions such that, within every such 
regiion, Y distance varies linearly with latitude, for a particular X value, 
and can also be divided into regions such that, within every such regioin,   
X distance varies linearly with longitude, for a particular Y value.

A projection possessing that property is a �linear projection�.

[end of definition of linearity property]

A projection has the linearity2 property if a map precisely constructed on 
that projection can be divided into regions such that,  within every such 
region, Y distance varies linearly with latitude, for a particular X value, 
and X varies linearly with longitude, for a particular Y value.

[end of definition of linearity2 property]

As I said, linearity, the first property defined above is what I officially 
mean by �linearity�. But linearity2 is probably possessed by all the linear 
projections of interest. So, as a practical matter, I�ll often use the 
simpler linearity2 definition.

Obviously any linear function is linearly interpolable, and so any linear 
projection possesses the linearly interposable positions property (LIPP). 
Sometimes I�ll speak of linearity, sometimes I�ll speak of LIPP.

Projection definitions:

I�d like to revise my terminology for the projections that I�d previously 
named �graduated equidistant projections�

Those projections were linear projections that approximate co formality. 
But, by a similar construction, linear projections can approximate 
equal-area too.

A �linear approximate conformal projection� is a linear projection that 
approximates conformality. One that approaches conformality, as an 
unattainable limit, as the latitude bands become smaller and more numerous.

Within each latitude band, the north-south scale is equal to the geometric 
mean of the east-west scales along the two parallels that bound that 
latitude band.

[end of definition of a linear approximate conformal projection]

A linearly approximate equal-area projection is a linear projection that 
approximates equal-area. One that approaches equal-area as an unattainable 
limit, as the latitude bands become smaller and more numerous.

Within each latitude band, the north-south scale varies inversely with  the 
geometric mean of the east-west scales along the two parallels that bound 
that latitude band.

[end of definition of a linear approximate equal-area projection]

�linear approximate conformal projection� will be abbreviated �LA conformal 
projection�.
�linearly approximate equal-area projection� will be abbreviated �LA 
equal-area projection�.

A projection is an LA projection if it is an LA conformal projection or an 
LA equal-area projection.

The projections that I formerly called �graduated equidistant projections� 
are LA conformal projections.

LA[projection-name] is the LA projection that approaches the 
[projection-name] projection as an unattainable  limit, as the latitude 
bands become smaller and more numerous.

For instance, the projection that I�d formerly called the graduated 
equidistant cylindrical is the LA Mercator projection.

Of course there is an LA Mollweide projection, and LA Eckert IV projection, 
an LA Gall�s Orthographic projection, and LA Peters projection, etc.

I admit that I advocated LA cylindrical equidistant out of personal 
prejudice. I like conformal projections. Conformality is, of course a very 
useful property. The fact that the scale, at any particular point, is the 
same in every direction greatly facilitates distance measurement, for 
instance. And directions can be more accurately judged from the map.

I felt that a data map might as well have an additional property that I 
like, in addition to linearity, and so I chose near-conformality as that 
property.

But I must admit that conformality, as useful as it is, is unlikely to be 
needed on a data map.

As Daan pointed out, for the purpose that I expressed (accurate 
determination and measurement of position)  the cylindrical equidistant is 
the best. It is the best projection for data maps when equal-area isn�t 
needed.

And, as Daan pointed out, and as I immediately agreed, equal-area is 
desirable on data maps, for many (maybe most) kinds of data, such as species 
ranges, vegetation-regions, land-use, etc.

There is exactly one linear equal-area map: The sinusoidal. And so the 
sinusoidal was my first recommendation (and still probably my best 
recommendation) for a projection for a data map when equal area matters. For 
one thing, as I said, it�s the only truly equal-area linear projection.

But, if equal-area doesn�t have to be  _exactly_ attained, then the LA 
equal-area maps become possibilities.

Linear maps for people who are willing to calculate the transformation 
between lat/lon and X,Y:

I mentioned in my first posting here that linear data maps are only needed 
for those who don�t want to calculate conversions between lat/lon and X,Y, 
other than by linear interpolation.

For anyone else, linearity isn�t needed. It could still be convenient, but 
other properties could be more desirable.

First, let me say tha the equal-area cylindrical has such a brief lat/lon  
X,Y conversion formula that that calculation might be acceptable to people 
who ordinarily would only be willing to use linear interpolation. So 
projections such as Peters, Gall Orthographic, Balthazart, etc., might be 
acceptable for such people.

But maybe not. I still claim that, for the general public, for atlases and 
nature-guides for the general public, data maps should be linear.

I�m just saying that maps such as Peters are near the margin of becoming 
acceptable to those who don�t want to do calculation.

For the person who is willing to do more calculation to convert between 
lat,lon and X,Y , linearity isn�t essential. For such persons, when 
equal-area is desired for a data map, other equatorial-aspect equal-area 
maps could be considered. Such as Mollweide, Eckert VI, Eckert IV, or such 
cylindrical equal-area maps as Peters, Gall Orthographic, Balthazart, or 
Tristan Edwards.

Eckert IV moderates the less-desirable qualities of the cylindrical 
equal-area.  Moderating the cylindrical equal-area just enough to achieve a 
more civilized appearance.. Therefore, being as close as possible to 
cylindrical, Eckert IV seems more justified than Eckert VI.

Mollweide is justified by its great realism. I consider Mollweide to be the 
most realistic-looking  world map projection (Orthographic elliptical is 
more realistic looking, but I consider it a picture rather than a map). Yes, 
even though Africa is portrayed a bit skinny on Mollweide.

LA Mollweide is much more realistic-looking than Apianus II, and of course 
has more accurate areas. Both are linear projections.

Such cylindrical equal-area versions as Peters, Gall Orthographic,  
Balthazart and Tristan Edwards (actual) are the extreme (Tristan Edwards is 
the most extreme that I�ve heard of).

So, sinusoidal, Mollweide, Eckert IV, and cylindrical equal area (Peters, 
Gall Orthographic, Balthazart, Tristan Edwards, etc.) seem the projections 
most of interest if someone willing to do calculation wants an equal-area 
data map.

As we all agree, sinusoidal should be interrupted when used as a world map. 
I like the USGS�s interrupted sinusoidal best.

Good shapes can be helpful in using a data map. Not necessary if measurement 
is the important thing, but otherwise helpful for clarity of direct 
perception. Among the aforementioned projections, interrupted sinusoidal 
wins by that standard. All the pseudocylindricals, including Mollweide and 
Eckert, can be interrupted. It would then be a choice between interrupted 
sinusoidal�s better shapes and natural linearity, vs. the better 
space-filling efficiency of the other projections, with resulting 
improvement in minimum scale for certain latitudes.

But sometimes getting the most accurate position measurements possible might 
be the important thing. Then, the other equal-area equatorial aspect maps 
mentioned above could be helpful. Especially the more extreme north-south 
expanded cylindrical equal area projections such as Peters.

Of special interest, then, is the minimum scale on the map. That will be a 
north-south scale at extreme latitudes. Here I don�t mean �scale� in the 
usual sense. When I say here �north-south scale� I mean the scale for the 
purpose of measuring latitude--the Y-direction scale between parallels. (as 
opposed to true north-south scale, measured along meridians).

Obviously, as we go from sinusoidal to Mollweide to Eckert IV to cylindrical 
equal-area, the east-west scale increases for extreme latitudes. Therefore  
the north-south scale decreases.

If one looked at that alone, one would expect the minimum scale to be less 
for a cylindrical equidistant map than for the sinusoidal. But the 
cylindrical equal area more efficiently uses its available rectangular 
page-space. Therefore it has greater total map area, and therefore greater 
area in every part.

For a given page width and map width, a cylindrical equal-area (CEA) map 
with a 2:1 aspect ratio (the aspect ratio of sinusoidal, Mollweide, and the 
Eckert pseudocylindricals), will have greater minimum scale (for 
position-measurement purposes) than the sinusoidal, up to latitude 50.

Peters and Gall Orthographic have greater minimum scale than sinusoidal up 
to latitude 60.

At the extreme, Tristan Edwards (actual) has greater minimum scale than the 
sinusoidal right up to the arctic circle.

Where a CEA map has greater minimum scale than the sinusoidal, it allows 
more precise measurement of positions.

All the CEA projections have greater east-west scale than the sinusoidal.

Mollweide and Eckert IV are of course intermediate between sinusoidal and 
cylindrical equal-area.

Similar comparisons could of course be done between any pair of projections 
among the set consisting of sinusoidal, Mollweide, Eckert IV, and CEA.

Obviously, the more a cylindrical equal-area map is expanded north-south, 
the greater its minimum scale is. And a book-page allows lots of room for 
north-south expansion. So that expansion is limited only by what it does to 
the map aesthetically. (or a desire to uses the rest of the page for text or 
other maps).

Alright, Peters looks awful. But not when you consider that it serves a 
valuable purpose--improvement in minimum scale up to some minimum latitude, 
as a result of more efficiently filling the available rectangular 
page-space.

Behrmann treats Africa and South America a lot better than the other CEA 
versions I�ve mentioned here, but it only has greater minimum scale than the 
sinusoidal up to latitude 41.

Of course, then, for the person who wants to convert between lat,lon and X,Y 
without any calculation other than linear interpolation,  the LA Mollweide, 
LA Eckert IV and LA cylindrical equal area would be possibilities. The 
considerations for choosing between those and the interrupted sinusoidal 
would be the same as those described above for the person who is willing to 
do calculation.

Of course when regions smaller than the entire Earth are being mapped, it 
makes less difference which projection is used. All of the projections 
mentioned above would be good equal-area data maps for smaller regions.

What if the map information is such that equal-area isn�t important? Maps 
with equally-spaced parallels tend to have better shapes than equal-area 
maps. (But LA Mollweide will still look better than Apianus II, because 
Apianus II�s nearly upright continents look artificial and out of place in 
the ellipse).

Equally-spaced parallels suggest a sequence that includes sinusoidal, 
Apianus II, Eckert V, Eckert III, and cylindrical equidistant.

But, when equal-area isn�t needed,  the choice seems simpler than when 
equal-area is desired. There�s less reason to not use the cylindrical 
projection.

Linear approximate is a function whose input is a cylindrical or 
pseudocylindrical map that is conformal or equal-area, and whose output is a 
linear cylindrical or pseudocylindrical map that approaches the input map as 
a limit, as the latitude zones become smaller and more numerous.

The definition that I've given, and the specification of the input map's 
shape--its borders--, and whether it is equal-area or conformal, defines a 
particular LA map.

Hi,

looks like this question has been posted in the past, but blimey, I
could not extract a simple answer that I do understand. Thus  I would
like to rephrase the question in the hope to get an easy to use answer
for someone not deep in geo math at all :)

I do have a coordinate in easting/northing [m] from a raster map  using
Gauss Krüger projection and Potsdam datum. Now I would like to get the
lon/lat coordinate on a WGS84 ellipsoid. And vice versa. I would like to
use the proj4 C API not the command line.

Can any kind soul take me by the hand and point me to some tutorial or
give me a quick guided tour?

Thanks,

Oliver

[First, I�d like to clarify that, in my definition of linear approximate 
projections, when I said �north-south scale�, I didn�t mean it in the usual 
sense, of scale measured along meridians. I mean, instead, the factor that 
relates latitude difference to Y distance on the map. The scale with regard 
to the Y distance between latitudes.]

Dr. Usery--

Thanks for the note. I want to emphasize that I only meant to mention an 
advantage of the Peters projection itself, along with the Galls Orthographic 
projection, and other cylindrical equal-area proposals such as Behrmann, 
Balthazart, and Tristan-Edwards (in the more extreme form in which it was 
actually printed). Those projections have value, for accurate position 
measurement by those willing to do a brief calculation, and also wanting 
equal area. Of course their LA counterparts would allow exact position 
measurement by linear interpolation, while slightly compromising equal area.

I agree with what you say about the promotion of the Peters projection by 
Arno Peters and others. Yes, that was a bit brazen, the claim that Peters 
was the only map that�s fair to the equatorial countries, and that it was 
the only equal-area projection.

The claim that Peters is the only equal area projection is an outrage 
whether or not Peters knew the statement wasn�t true.

As for tropical fairness, in fact, Peters makes a mess of the map appearance 
of the equatorial countries. I don�t call that fairness.

Peters and Gall Orthographic are similar enough that I could have just said 
�Gall�, and not �Peters�. But the cylindrical equal area is best known to 
the public as the Peters projection, and I guess I intentionally used the 
�Peters� name because, whether we like it or not, Peters is the public�s 
name for cylindrical equal-area, and so  I just wanted to emphasize that the 
map has a use, and hopefully is sometimes used for what it�s good for. It�s 
good to find a silver lining.

I agree that it shouldn�t really be called the Peters projection, because, 
as you pointed out, Lambert  proposed the cylindrical equal area projections 
in 1772, and especially because Gall had proposed a nearly identical version 
of it a century before Peters.

Of course another regrettable thing about the promotion of the Peters 
projection is the claim that it�s the best for all purposes and 
applications. But I only praised it, and the similar CEA projections, for 
one narrowly-defined purpose.

I�ve brought Peters�s unsuitability as a general purpose map to the 
attention of a few librarians at libraries that have the Peters Atlas. 
Someone with professional credentials should write to libraries, bookstores 
and organizations about the greatest scam and fiasco in the history of 
cartography. Maybe it�s already been done.

So, the use for Gall orthographic, Peters, Balthazart and Tristan-Edwards is 
: Precise position measurement, if the latitude isn�t too high,  if 
equal-area is desired, and if a brief calculation is acceptable (other than 
linear interpolation).

For instance, as I was saying, Gall Orthographic has more map Y distance 
corresponding to a given latitude difference, as compared to a sinusoidal of 
the same width, up to latitude 60, and, of course, more X distance 
corresponding to a given longitude difference everywhere. For example, at 
latitude 40, Gall Orthographic allows 30% more accurate longitude 
measurements and 53% more accurate latitude measurements, as compared a 
sinusoidal of the same map-width, fitting on the same page-width. That�s the 
advantage of maps like Gall�s orthographic and Peters. It�s an advantage if 
the important thing is position measurements on the map.

But the downside is that, with Galls Orthographic or Peters, a small square 
on the equator is expanded north-south so that its north-south dimension is 
twice its east-west dimension. In other words, at the equator, north-south 
distance is doubled with respect to east-west dimension. That�s a tremendous 
shape distortion. Yes, Mollweide distorts shape too, but its 
shape-distortion is plausible, rather than ridiculous looking.

I have to say that puts Gall�s and Peters�  value in question. Borneo on 
those maps doesn�t look like Borneo. One knows that it�s Borneo only because 
it�s where Borneo should be.  Of course those maps do a similar thing to 
Africa and South America. It seems a bit questionable how useful the 
equal-area property is when some parts of the map look so unlike the places 
that they map. I mean, one expects an equal-area map to give an intuitive 
view of where and how big.. How intuitively clear can that view be when 
tropical regions are shown so unlike its their actual shape?

Additionally, as opposed to making measurements on the map, a data map is 
often glanced at to get an impression of what is where. How good is that 
impression when shapes are so distorted?

You wrote:

FYI, the sinusoidal is by far the best equal area projection based on 
scientific tests of accuracy.

I reply:

Yes, even a glance at an interrupted sinusoidal shows that. Its shape 
accuracy is unmatched by any other equal-area world map.

Of course, as an added bonus, the sinusoidal is the only linear equal-area 
map. It is for that reason that I advocate the sinusoidal as the best data 
map when equal-area is desired.

I only praised the cylindrical equal area maps for one narrowly-defined 
purpose: maximally accurate position-measurement on the map, for an 
equal-area map, for a given map-width, fitting on a given page-width--for 
people willing to do a little more calculation than linear interpolation.

But the severe shape distortion of such maps as Gall Orthographic and Peters 
may lessen their value as equal-area maps and as data maps.

You continued:

Read the literature.

I reply:

I�m sure that it would be fascinating to look at, and I intend to do so. 
But, as I said, a glance is sufficient to show the superiority of the 
interrupted sinusoidal as an equal-area world map.

Ok, further investigations condensed into something like:

pjgaukru = pj_init_plus("+init=epsg:31467");
pjwgs84 = pj_init_plus("+init=epsg:4326");

// easting / northing to lon / lat
pt = pj_inv(pt,pjgaukru)

//???
double z = 0;

pj_datum_transform(pjgaukru, pjwgs84, 1, 0, &pt.u, &pt.v, &z);

However the result is still several minutes away from the expected
coordinate. What do I miss?

Oliver,

How about:

pjgaukru = pj_init_plus("+init=epsg:31467");
pjwgs84 = pj_init_plus("+init=epsg:4326");

//???
double z = 0;

pj_datum_transform(pjgaukru, pjwgs84, 1, 0, &pt.u, &pt.v, &z);

Don't forget that the output is pt.u with the longitude in
radians, and pt.v with the latitude in radians.  The call
you make to pj_inv() is duplicating work that is done by
pj_transform() (corrupting really).

I would add that epsg:31467 expands as:

+proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=9 +k=1.000000 +x_0=3500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=bessel 
+datum=potsdam +units=m +no_defs

Note that this definition is using +datum=potsdam which expands to:

   +ellps=bessel +towgs84=606.0,23.0,413.0

This may or may not be the best datum shift parameters for your area of
work.  You may need to research a better local shift.

That should be ok. These are maps from "Bayerisches
Landesvermessungsamt". Hope they know what they are doing.

Does that mean that the shift parameters depend on the location within
the map? Or that the whole map might have some kind of bad offset
produced by a bad projection?

And how would I get better shift parameters? Is there a tutorial somewhere?

Thanks,

Oliver

Oliver,

The 3/7 parameter +towgs84 parameters are just used for an approximate
transformation between datums. Sometimes, especially for old datums, the
differences are quite irregular over the area of the datum and are not well
represented by a simple transformation.

So, you will often see datums having various towgs84 parameters, some which
might be a decent general transformation over a large area and others which
might be a more accurate transformation in a fairly local area of the
datum.

Ugly, isn't it?

No, there is no obvious way to get better parameters other than researching
various source (ie. national mapping agencies, other publications, ask other
users in your region).

Hi Frank,

I feared you will say that. Well as the original data and software is
able to geo-reference the map correctly I guess I have to look for the 3
or 7 values in the original data. At least I know now what to look for :)

On last question: the z parameter for pj_transform() is the height isn't
it?

please take a look at 
http://crs.bkg.bund.de/crseu/crs/descrtrans/BeTA/de_dhdn2etrs_beta.php

There you will find information about a "standard" solution 
for your problem. The documentation gives a brief example
for using PROJ.4. (I think, the german language isn't a problem
for you :-)).

If you have any problems, please let me know.

Best wishes

Oliver,

Yes, sorry for not answering that aspect the first time around.

Some transformation (such as datum shifts and changes of ellipsoid) can
also alter the elevation about the ellipsoid so we provide a z to transform
even if we ignore the results.

Hi Uwe

Ok, had a look at it. Maybe it's a dump question (I am really not
professional in this area) but as my target datum is WGS84 shouldn't I
use different shift factors than for ETRS89?

Or is the shift from ETRS89 to WGS84 independent from the actual
location? Google gives me the impression that it is.

Hi Oliver,
 
No question is ever dumb. If no one ever asks, no one can ever learn.
 
A technical definition from Wikipedia states:
 
"The European Terrestrial Reference System 1989, usually referred to as ETRS89, is a three-dimensional geodetic frame of reference - a mapping coordinate system used as the standard high accuracy system for GPS in Europe.
 
It coincided with the World Geodetic System 1984 in 1989, hence the name, and is based on the same GRS80 ellipsoid. Unlike WGS84 or ITRS it is centred on Europe and diverges from them with the movements of the tectonic plates associated with this landmass."
 
Please see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETRS89 for ETRS89
                 and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System_1984 for WGS84
 
These are some pretty good description of some systems used in Geodesy.
 
Cheers,
Dean

Hi Oliver,
 
I forgot to add the following:
 
The parameters for a datum shift (dx, dy, dz, rx, ry, rz, etc.) between ETRS89 and WGS84 are not constant, due to the movement of the Eurasian geophysical plate with respect to WGS84. The differences between both datums can grow by several centimetres a year. Currently they are a couple of decimetres in difference. For many applications, these differences are not relevant. Coordinates or positions in WGS84 have usually been obtained by GPS and this results in an accuracy at the level of several metres. However, satellite positioning techniques continuously improve in accuracy, also without using differential stations. So the differences between the datum's will grow. Note that many nations are using WGS84 to define boundaries nowadays - so WGS84 is relevant.
 
In your case and for your application, I do believe you will be fine using ETRS89.
 
Cheers,
Dean

Hi Uwe and Dean,

it seems to work. A reference point of:

x = 4459750 m  y = 5448182 m

is converted to

E11.446588 N49.169494

The GeoGrid Viewer (Uwe should know) tells me:

E11.44662  N49.16951

That is approx. 1 or 2 meters apart. I can't tell if that is a normal
error because of the different calculation code. But I guess I have to
be happy with it :) .

BTW can anyone tell me why on earth the Europeans define a datum that is
identical to WGS84 in 1989 but will have an increasing error over the
years? Is that politics or just to keep things, located in Europe, from
'moving' (in respect to WGS84)?

Thank you all for your answers.

Oliver

Hello all!

We have solved this problem with moving plates by adding a simple date with the coordinates of WGS84. That way you can always go back to the original position of that particular date in WGS84 (or any). The WGS84 datum (with date)  will stay accurate for ever, since it is always possible to trace back where the plates were at that specific date.

latitude,
longitude,
(WGS84),
date

That's it. At the moment we don't need this feature, but it is there to be sure that the positions recorded will always stay accurate.

Regards Janne.

The differences between both datums can grow by several centimetres a year. Currently they are a couple of decimetres in difference. For many applications, these differences are not relevant. Coordinates or positions in WGS84 have usually been obtained by GPS and this results in an accuracy at the level of several metres. However, satellite positioning techniques continuously improve in accuracy, also without using differential stations. So the differences between the datum's will grow. Note that many nations are using WGS84 to define boundaries nowadays - so WGS84 is relevant.

Message-ID: <CA803441152AAE40935609509953BAD2EAB0E2@s0-ott-x4.nrn.nrcan.gc.ca>

Hi,

I am trying to specify an oblique Mercator projection using proj.4 in
GRASS.

I am looking for some advice about the valid range of the parameters
lat_1, lat_2, etc.

I am trying to specify an "omerc" as follows:

>+proj=omerc +lat_0=45.1875000000 +lat_1=-20.0000000000
> +lat_2=20.0000000000 +lon_0=0.0000000000 +lon_1=-120.0000000000 
> +lon_2=-60.0000000000 +k_0=1.0000000000 +no_uoff +rot_conv +a=6378137
> +rf=298.257223563 +no_defs +towgs84=0.000,0.000,0.000

GRASS support said that absolute value of lat_0 must be less than 36.
Sure enough when I put lat_0 equal 35, proj worked.  BUT then I wanted
to change the other parameter lat_1, Lat_2, etc. to achieve the required
rotation.  I would like:

Lat_1 = -20
Lat_2 = 23
Lon_1 = -120
Lon_2 = 45

(I estimated these parameters by doing a reprojection of my dataset in
Global Mapper)

But proj fails.

On a related note, what is the accepted range of the +alpha parameter in
the alternative specification of omerc?

Any advice would be appreciated,

Garret Duffy.

Hi Garret,

Try omitting +lon_0 and making sure that lat_0 is on the central line of 
the projection. I was able to initialize proj with:

proj +proj=omerc +lat_0=0 +lat_1=-20 +lat_2=23 +lon_1=-120 +lon_2=45 +no_uoff +rot_conv +a=6378137 +rf=298.257223563 +no_defs +towgs84=0.000,0.0,0.0

+45.1875 might be just above the central line. 

I don't have an answer about the alpha range, but depending on how it's set 
up, you should be able to use 0 to 360, or possibly -180 to +180. Not in 
proj, but in an ESRI projection package we have a math problem when alpha=90 
that we had to fix.
