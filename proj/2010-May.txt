Subject: [Proj] [MS Windows] Some issues with proj-4.7.0 (repost)
Message-ID: <D076801E159C4EF884CCD8C6F42A41D5@desktop2>

Hi,

I originally posted this before subscribing and, afaict, it's still waiting 
for moderator approval - apologies if that duplicate turns up at some time 
(or has already turned up). Anyway, I'm subscribed now.

I build using the MinGW port of gcc in the MSYS shell - ie I build in the
normal way, with './configure', 'make', 'make check' and 'make install'.

First Issue
=======

With proj-4.7.0, I had to make only one small amendment to the source in
order for the build to succeed.

In pj_mutex.c, I replaced the one occurrence of

#ifdef MUTEX_pthread
with
#if defined(MUTEX_pthread) && !defined(MUTEX_win32)

This was done to avoid entry into that block, as I don't have pthread.h
(which that block of code wants to #include). I think it is possible to
build pthreads for windows, but it's something I haven't done. I'm not sure
what the correct fix actually is - but that worked fine. Seems odd that
MUTEX_pthread is defined for me, given that I don't have pthreads.

Second Issue
=========

The MinGW64 (x64) compiler's winreg.h typedefs a PVALUE type, as also does
projects.h - so there's a "conflicting types" error whenever both projects.h
and winreg.h are included (as is the case with my apps). So I changed the
few occurrences of PVALUE in the proj-4.7.0 source to P_VALUE, and re-built.
That, too, works fine. Is it possible for that alteration to be made to the
official source ? (There were only 3 or 4 occurrences of the term - in
projects.h and pj_param.c only.) Or is there some other way that this
conflict should be handled ?

Cheers,
Rob

Subject: [Proj] DHDN / Soldner Berlin Lagerstatus 600/660
Message-ID: <1273129612899-5012893.post@n2.nabble.com>


I have added 2 definitions to be used with Berlin Maps before 1920.

http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6880/
also known as 'Lagerstatus 660'
http://spatialreference.org/ref/sr-org/6881/
also known as 'Soldner 18 (Lagerstatus 600)'

Both entries are based on:
http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/3068/
- also known as 'Soldner 18+ (Lagerstatus 500)'

which replaced both systems in 1920.

Lagerstatus 660:
Soldner (Lagerstatus 660) [Rote Rathaus] Der trigonometrische Punkt 1.
Ordnung Rathausturm der Preußischen Landesaufnahme (1880-1920)

was used in the city of Berlin before 'Greater Berlin' was founded in 1920.
The maps best known the use this System are from the Straube Verlag which
issued about 52 Maps with a Scale of 1:4000 between 1880 and about 1914.
Its base is the Tower of the "Rote Rathaus" in Berlin.
- Position used [Wsg84] : 52.51853551623,13.4082084807193
- translated to epsg:4314 (also known as DE_2001) :
52.5199414507768338467030844	13.4099492845861494316750395
The used values have been tested against properly scaled Straube maps (using
many different positions, among them :  Brandenburger Tor - Quadriga):

echo "52.5162688474131 13.3776841069923" | cs2cs -E -f "%.25f" -r -s
+init=epsg:4326 +to +init=epsg:6880
-251.7401732723124609947262798 -2072.1554116002071168622933328
8.2979221819696249440312386

Lagerstatus 500:
was used outside of the city of Berlin before 'Greater Berlin' was founded
in 1920.

The maps known to use this System are 'Deutsch-Wilmersdorf', Verlag Julius
Straube, which issued about 19 Maps with a Scale of 1:4000 in 1907.

The only difference between this and epsg:3068 is that the central point of
Müggelberg is 0,0 as apposed to 40000,10000 used after 1920.

Sample (again Brandenburger Tor - Quadriga) for both systems: 

echo "52.5162688474131 13.3776841069923" | cs2cs -E -f "%.25f" -r -s
+init=epsg:4326 +to +init=epsg:6881
- 11046.9105895095381129067391157	-16818.1969025177713774610310793
8.2979221819696249440312386

echo "52.5162688474131 13.3776841069923" | cs2cs -E -f "%.25f" -r -s
+init=epsg:4326 +to +init=epsg:3068
- 21046.9105895095381129067391157	23181.8030974822286225389689207
8.2979221819696249440312386

With these 3 entries, most Berlin city maps between 1880 and now, can be
transformed.

As apposed to Müggelberg and Rauenberg, I know of no 'official' DE_2001
position for the Rote Rathausturm 
(and the Marienkirche - which together with Müggelberg/Rauenberg formed the
'Hauptdreieck').
Should anyone have these positions, I would be interested in receiving them.

Hi,
someone can tell me why if I set a center o stereo projection on lat 0.0 and
lon 0.0 the inverse projection (stereo to geo), return always 0E 0N.

Thank you

It works for a sphere, but not an ellipsoid.

The problem is that the setup function doesn't initialise all of the
values that it needs for the ellipsoid, inverse, equatorial case.

In the forward and spherical inverse cases, the equatorial case
(|phi0| < 1e-10) is a simplification of the oblique case, and requires
fewer parameters. However, for the ellipsoid inverse case (e_inverse),
the oblique calculation is used, but the setup function doesn't
initialise all of the parameters.

Modifying the setup() function in PJ_stere.c so that EQUIT and OBLIQ
use the same code should fix the problem.

I've been using PROJ4 in GDAL and in GRASS but now, I need to do some GCP's
evaluation and I have a very dumbest question:
- I'm using  GOOGLE Earth to retrieve GCP and I want to know what is their
EPSG code? As far as I know GOogle Earth uses WGS84 and I believe to be EPSG
4326 but I'm not sure because its projection is lat long and GOogle Earth's
WGS84 is UTM.

Franz, I believe all google earth is in WGS84/EPSG:4326, but it can display
in utm.  You can change the display in Tools->Options.

Subject: [Proj] Post-projection affine transformations?
Message-ID: <8E90C2C4-D09C-4667-9773-31E14AC41C3C@stamen.com>

Hello,

I'm trying to determine whether Proj parameters can express an arbitrary post-projection affine transformation, e.g. shear or rotation. I've looked at the +towgs84 parameter but this doesn't seem to be a good fit. Is it possible to transform a projection, for example to flip a mercator map upside-down? I'm rendering images with Mapnik which seems to use Proj internally.

Mike,

Generally speaking I'm not aware of a way of doing arbitrary post
projection affine transformations as part of the projection process
via proj commandline switches.

However, "proj trunk" does add new commandline arguments for switching
around the axes that might be sufficient for your mirroring needs.  If
you can build with trunk, you could try adding something like:

   +axis=esu

which means that the X axis is "easting" the Y axis is "southing"
and the Z axis is "up".

Best regards,

Subject: [Proj] Ellipsoidal geodesic projections
Message-ID: <ssrvda767ox.fsf@puffin.sarnoff.com>

I've started playing with some projections that can be defined in terms
of ellipsoidal geodesics and would be interested to have references to
prior work on these or similar projections.  The ones I'm interested in
are:

(1) Oblique Cassini-Soldner: Like Cassini-Soldner but replace the origin
    meridian with a reference geodesic at an arbitrary azimuth.  (Thus,
    starting at origin proceed along reference geodesic v meters, turn
    clockwise 90deg and proceed along a geodesic u meters.)

(2) Two-point equidistant: Solve a triangle given 3 sides, described by
    Mauer (but only for a sphere??).  Easily generalizes to an
    ellipsoid.

(3) Two-point azimuthal: Solve a triangle given 2 angles and the
    included side, described by Mauer (but only for a sphere??).  Easily
    generalizes to an ellipsoid.  Geodesics are roughly straight.

(4) Gnomonic: For a sphere all geodesics are straight.  For an ellipsoid,
    take the limit of the two-point azimuthal projection as the two points
    approach one another.  All the geodesics intersecting the origion are
    straight.  Nearby geodesics are approximately straight.

As far as I know, no-one has looked at (1), (2), or (3); but I'm
probably wrong about this.  Roy Williams, "Geometry of Navigation",
gives an ellipsoidal version of the gnomonic projection.  But this is
just a rescaling of the spherical version and does not keep the
geodesics very straight.

About ellipsoidal gnomonic, I had got the impression from 
your documentation of GeographicLib that it was possible
to construct such a projection with all geodesics exactly
straight.

So I must have misunderstood this text. I guess "the geodesic" 
does not stand for an arbitrary geodesic but only one of 
those that intersect an origin point?

Greetings

I've been using PROJ4 in GDAL and in GRASS but now, I need to do some GCP's
evaluation and I have a very dumbest question:
- I'm using  GOOGLE Earth to retrieve GCP and I want to know what is their
EPSG code? As far as I know GOogle Earth uses WGS84 and I believe to be EPSG
4326 but I'm not sure because its projection is lat long and GOogle Earth's
WGS84 is UTM.

Thank you once again
Franz

It's true that the transformation to the auxiliary sphere converts a
geodesic to a great circle.  However the equation for the longitude on
the auxiliary sphere depends on the azimuth of the geodesic.  Thus the
transformation does not define a map projection.  Symbolically, the
auxiliary sphere transformation is

  (beta, omega) = f(phi, lambda; alpha0)

[phi = latitude, lambda = longitude, beta = reduced latitude, omega =
longitude on auxiliary sphere, alpha0 = geodesic azimuth at equator
crossing].  The presence of the alpha0 parameter in the transformation
disqualifies it as the basis for a map projection.
