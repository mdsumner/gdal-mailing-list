Bart, 

The datum shifting works fine in unix .so files, the only problems on
windows is that I haven't added all the entry points to the proj.def file.
It shouldn't be hard.  I would encourage you to do it, and send me back the
updated proj.def file.  If you have problems with the datum shifting support
(which is pretty new) I am glad to help. 

Mainly I think you need to add the pj_transform entry point to proj.def, but
there are a bunch of other function called less often by the application that
could also be added, such as pj_datum_transform, pj_geocentric_to_geodetic, 
pj_geodetic_to_geocentric, and pj_compare_datums.

My lookup in the EPSG database says that the RD projection is based on
Oblique Stereographic which I currently map to the "stere" projection in
PROJ.4.  I have no personal experience with how accurate this is though. 

The EPSG database include a 7 parameter transformation to WGS84 from
Amersfoort.  You should definately check the results of this, since I
have only done decent testing on the 3 parameter datum transformations,
not the seven.  My unvalidated hand translation of EPSG CS 29882
(RD / Netherlands New) would be:

+proj=stere +lat_0=52.1561605555555 +lon_0=5.38763888888888 +k=0.9999079
            +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 
            +towgs84=593.16,26.15,478.54,-6.3239,-0.5008,-5.5487,4.0775
            +ellps=bessel

Let me know if this produces reasonable results.

Hi Frank,

I did some testing using the proj.exe command line mode.

The Dutch projection works absolutely perfect with the parameters you
suggested, only the datum shift parameters seem to be ignored on the
command line.

The fact that it does the projection so nicely made us decide to drop
other alternatives like GCTP and Geotrans and use PROJ.4 for our
projects from now on. 
I suppose we will get the datum shift to work somehow, maybe with a
little advice from you. 

Whatever improvements we might make on the code itself we will surely
feed back to you, but the idea is to use the DLL "as is" without any
modifications.

Thanks a lot for your support sofar !

Bart, 

Sorry about the datum this, my fault. 

The proj.exe program itself doesn't include datum shifting support.  I wrote
a similar mainline program called cs2cs (coordinate system to coordinate 
system) which internally calls the pj_transform() function as opposed to
the simple LL<->proj functions pj_fwd() and pj_inv().  

In short, I think you should be able to do something like:

cs2cs +proj=stere +lat_0=52.1561605555555 +lon_0=5.38763888888888 +k=0.9999079
            +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 
            +towgs84=593.16,26.15,478.54,-6.3239,-0.5008,-5.5487,4.077 
            +ellps=bessel
      +to +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84

This would translated between the dutch projection and latlong coordinates 
in WGS84.  To do the reverse:

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84
      +to +proj=stere +lat_0=52.1561605555555 +lon_0=5.38763888888888 +k=0.9999079
            +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 
            +towgs84=593.16,26.15,478.54,-6.3239,-0.5008,-5.5487,4.077 
            +ellps=bessel
      
I hope to better document the datum support, cs2cs, and pj_transform() in the
next release of PROJ.4.  

All credit for the quality of transformations in PROJ.4 goes of course to 
Gerald Evenden who wrote it.

I have compiled cs2cs and tried, but somehow it produces very odd
results, coordinates that are completely out of range (west instead of
east)
Maybe you would like to check this yourself, if you simply type the +x0
+y0 coordinates as input, the output should be pretty close to +x_0 and
+y0 coordinates right ?


Rather then figuring out how the command line tools work, i will just
try make a DLL which exports pj_init and pj_transform, if i understand
correctly that would be just about all i need ?

I have just made a MSVC native project out of it so it should be easy to
debug the DLL now and see what exactly is going on under the hood....

I'll keep you posted,

Ryan, 

You need to run te "nad2bin" program on the .lla files to produce binary
files.  For instance:

 nad2bin conus < conus.lla

I think the conus.lla is the same as the conus.las, and the conus file is
the same as the conus.los, but I am not absolutely sure.  

Once you have built binary versions of the grid shift files, you may need to
set the PROJ_LIB environment variable to point to the directory holding them. 
I must confess that a "make install" on unix will take care of all this but
that the windows binary distribution is less well organized. 

You might want to take further questions to the PROJ.4 mailing list. 

PS. I tried your call on my system, and got the following results:

warmerda at gdal3[127]% nad2nad -i 27,spcs=3501,feet -o 83,spcs=3501,feet -r conus -
2621567.03 412678.73

Message-ID: <DA33E5AD19D7934293111258344DDCC10D4D84@SUSOKC0005>

I am trying to convert nad27 coord data to nad83. I am using the following
command syntax:

nad2nad -i 27,spcs=3501,feet -o 83,spcs=3501,feet -r conus - 2621567.0316

I get the following output:

-31615.53       30.06

I am confused about two things:

1) Is the syntax correct? (I am trying to convert State=Oklahoma
Region=North data)

2) All I have are two data files for oklahoma data: okhpgn.los and
okhpgn.las. Why are my files seperated into thes two types. Can I used these
types or do I need to a) convert them into one file as is the other state
files shipped with proj or b) can I use them as is?

NOTE: These oklahoma data files are located in the proj directory
(/usr/local/share/proj) with the other data files shipped.

Thanks for any help!
