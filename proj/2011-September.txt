Subject: [Proj] Axis orientations resource
Message-ID: <4E64AE1B.7060209@geomatys.fr>

Hello all

As a side effect of the GeoAPI wrapper work, there is a list of all EPSG codes 
supported by Proj.4 grouped by their axis orientations. There is the URL in case 
it may be of some use:

https://geoapi.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/geoapi/trunk/geoapi-proj4/src/main/resources/org/opengis/wrapper/proj4/axis-orientations.txt

I presume that similar resource already exists somewhere else. But for GeoAPI I 
needed not only the axis orientations of the CRS itself, but also the axis 
orientations of the base CRS when applicable. So in the above file, orientations 
like "en,ne" are for "<orientation of projected CRS>,<orientation of base CRS>".

     Regards,

         Martin

Subject: [Proj] ESRI proj codes
Message-ID: <201109081332.p88DWxCu000385@smtp-auth.uni-koeln.de>

The NAD directory of proj4 contains the files esri and esri-other 
with additional codes numbered above 100000.

These useful additional codes are not recognized by the EPSG web site 
http://www.epsg-registry.org/. They are also not in the official 
Access database file EPSG_v7_9.mdb.   They are however linked on the 
http://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/ site.

Is there an Internet source for the latest ESRI data which can be 
used to create a supplementary table for the EPSG Access database and 
which can be updated when ESRI or EPSG adds or changes something?

Subject: [Proj] What is EPSG code for ST74 0 gon 65:0 projection.
Message-ID: <1315491536912-6772007.post@n2.nabble.com>

I have a shapefile with projection ST74 0 gon 65:0 (represents Lidingö area
in stockholm). What is the EPSG code for this projection ? I have searched
and find that EPSG code for ST74 is 3152 but it did not work fully. I want
to change this projection into EPSG:4326 by using ogr2ogr tool.  But when i
convert from EPSG:3152 to EPSG:4326, i noted that shapefile does not fit on
correct location (Lidingö). Instead It placed near Eskilstuna. (A place
approx 100 km away from stockholm).

Its bounding box values were 16.398, 59.353 (for Eskilstuna area), when
converted from 3152 to 4326.
but actually, the bounding box values for Lidingö should be 18.345, 59.234
(for Lidingö area)

Is there any way to solve this problem ?

ESRI documents the various codes in their online help.  I'm not sure if there is a single place for all of them (outside the SDK header file pedef.h which is considered a "trade secret").  For instance, the C++ API has several projection related constants.

http://help.arcgis.com/en/sdk/10.0/arcobjects_cpp/componenthelp/index.html#/esriSRProjCSType_Constants/000w0000003q000000/

Yes, but the trick is you have to know the coordinate system for the data.  The prj file is just a text file.  I think Frank's OGR tool might be able to help.

Hello Mustafa.

There are two EPSG codes that are interesting, 3152 for ST74 and 3854 for County ST74.
 I think these two are nearly the same, but one may be a little more accurate. 
However, your problem is that both represent ST 74 0 gon 65:-1, to use the full Swedish name.
 There is a tradition (now deprecated by the Land Survey) to adapt the offsets (false easing and northing) for local use
so that 5-digit meter coordinates can be used inside a local 100 km square. The ending n:e of a Swedish CRS name means that
 the False Northing and False Easting are n and e multiplied by -100 000 m.  So the EPSG systems have FN = -6 500 000 m and FE = 100 000 m, but you need FN = -6 500 000 m and FE = 0 m.

 Well, that is not quite true; these round numbers are valid if you start with the true ST74 as the geodetic datum. In EPSG the datum is SWEREF99 (nearly WGS84) and the slightly modified projection parameters give a good approximation of the CRS in terms of SWEREF99.

So, ST74 0 gon 65:0 does not have an EPSG code. But take either EPSG:3854 or EPSG:3152,
 and decrease the False Easting by 100 000 m; that should be what you want.

Irwin, 

There currently is not a complete list available online. The ArcObjects enumeration lists are not complete. These are definitions defined by Esri. Sometimes EPSG adds the definitions later, and then Esri updates the well-known IDs to the EPSG one (as more authoritative). Some are beyond the scope of EPSG, like the county-level or multi-county-level systems in use in some US states.

Eric, 

The pedef.h file is not considered a trade secret! It used to be included in the online help for ArcSDE, but I believe we stopped that when the files got pretty large. It's not really enough information to build the PROJ tables. You would need access to the well-known text strings, or the PE library to get the parameters, unit, gcs, etc.

Subject: [Proj] Projection gs48 error?
Message-ID: <72EBF33A-6A8F-4DA8-B76E-DCEEA0BC2D7E@wwwtools.com>

In the routine PJ_mod_ster.c which handles the gs48 projection
the code is:

ENTRY0(gs48)
	static COMPLEX /* 48 United States */
AB[] = {
	{0.98879,	0.},
	{0.,		0.},
	{-0.050909,	0.},

};

	P->n = 4;
	P->lam0 = DEG_TO_RAD * -96.;
	P->phi0 = DEG_TO_RAD * -39.;
	P->zcoeff = AB;
	P->es = 0.;
	P->a = 6370997.;
ENDENTRY(setup(P))

I believe that phi0 should be +39 instead of -39.

After I made this change and recompiled/linked I ran the
following tests:

$proj +proj=gs48
-96 39
-0.00	-20670.77
$proj -I +proj=gs48
0 -20670.77	
96dW	39d0'0.759"N
$proj -I +proj=gs48
0 0	
168dE	39dN

I would expect the lon/lat at -96,39 to be 0,0 in x/y, and 0,0 x/y
to be at -96,39.

Any help would be greatly appreciated :-)

The Access database EPSG-v7_9.mdb contains 4924 COORD_REF_SYS 
codes.  4416 of these have Proj data which can be gleaned by 
combining the epsg and esri lists from the NAD directory out of a 
total of 6577 codes in these lists, eliminating "Unknown", 
"Unspecified" and searching for all correspondences between the NAD 
code numbers and the EPSG code numbers.

How were the esri and esri-extra lists in that directory obtained?

When EPSG adds definitions defined by Esri, do these get new numbers 
in the EPSG Access database or is there a systematic relationship 
between Esri numbers prior to adoption by EPSG and after 
incorporating them in the EPSG database?

Irwin,

I believe I generated these PROJ.4 init files.  I ran a script to
process a directory full of ESRI projection engine .prj files from
some ESRI product.  This was done a number of years ago and I have
not attempted to update them.

I can't say authoritatively, but I assume they are renumbered.  I believe
ESRI deliberately chooses numbers well outside the EPSG norm and EPSG
assigns numbers in their normal ranges when they incorporate the coordinate
systems into their master database.

[Proj] Problem with alsk projection

Indeed, there are errors in several sections of PROJs and libprojs mod_ster.
See my posting dated Feb 17, 2008; 9:31am,
subject:  Small errors in modified stereographic

The phi0 in GS48 should be 39.0 instead of -39.0
The value of A3 in Lee should be -0.00881625 (not -0.0088162).
Reference: J. P. Snyder: Map projections, a working manual, PP 1395, Ch. 26, 
p. 209.

Nobody was interested at that time and the errors remained.
I will not "file a ticket" or whatever the bug reporting procedure is 
called.

Why ALSK gives an incorrect answer in some cases, I don't know.
My own mod_ster function is derived from GCTP and its mod_ster function just 
works better.

Well,  it only says, "TRADE SECRETS: ESRI PROPRIETARY AND CONFIDENTIAL" at the top of the file!  I think most of the ArcSDE C SDK header files have that boilerplate.  Lawyers!

Anyway, you're right that it is just a bunch of preprocessor #define constants and does not include the full definition.  But, I thought the OP just wanted the codes...

All,

I would like to volunteer to support incorporating CMake build support inside of Proj.  Essentially, I would like to bring http://gitorious.org/proj4-cmake into the main tree and keep it up to date with build system changes.  The CMake build would exist as an alternative to automake and/or the nmake stuff on Windows, and it is not expected to supplant either at any time in the near future.

I look forward to your feedback,

Howard

That would be cool.  It's easy to make a framework target with cmake on OS X.  I can help with that part.

let say i have following bounding box values:

Bounding Box (Min X, Max X) = 161691.814, 161835.595
Bounding Box (Min Y, Max Y) = 6581562.789, 6581647.802

then, what will be the projection file or EPSG code ?

Mustafa,

No, knowing a bounding box does not help determine the EPSG code.  At best
it might make it possible to eliminate some.  For instance the above is
clearly not a geographic (lat/long) coordinate system based on degrees.

Looks like UTM, Southern Hemisphere, West of the Central Meridian of some Zone.  Which Zone is impossible to determine other than knowing what the context of the data represents as all 60 Southern Hemisphere Zones can have the same identical set of coordinates.  If you narrow the Zones down to where there's an area of interest, you have a good clue.

Hello Mustafa,

> If bounding box values are given, then can we determin the projection ?

The short answer is no.

> Bounding Box (Min X, Max X) = 161691.814, 161835.595 Bounding Box (Min Y, Max Y) = 6581562.789, 6581647.802

But if we assume the projection is Transverse Mercator in meters,
with origin at the equator, then the bounding box would be roughly 
at latitude 59d20' N, which is the latitude of Stockholm.

Since you have asked about the Stockholm area before, 
this suggests a CRS for Sweden (perhaps you already knew that).
The Swedish projections based on the old RT90 datum would
have seven-digits easting, so they are ruled out. 
   
I think the projection is based on the new datum SWEREF99,
but it cannot be the national SWEREF99 TM, because the 
bounding box would then be somewhere in Norway, I think.

But I think it is the regional projection SWEREF99 18 00.
http://www.lantmateriet.se/templates/LMV_Page.aspx?id=4219&lang=EN
It has central meridian at 18d E and false easting = 150 000 m,
so your bounding box would be about 12 km east of meridian 18d E,
(and at latitude 59d20' N).  That's Stockholm, isn't it? 

Or maybe it is a projection based on ST74.

Hi,

I was looking for some information on American Polyconic and came across
this page:

http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/polyconic.html

I think the PROJ.4 information at the bottom of the page should be corrected
to say +proj=poly instead of +proj=stere and also to include +k.  Or am I
missing something?

Thanks,

carl

It appears to be a problem with the test script.  As floating point numbers, minus zero and positive zero compare equal.  But, as text, they are different.

Hello Carl,

I agree.

> also to include +k.

No, as far as I can see, +proj=poly does not support a scale factor +k.
I would say that a scale factor is normally used only with a conformal
projection, and the polyconic is not conformal.  Snyder's formulas* for
the polyconic does not mention a scale factor (unless I overlooked it).

Subject: [Proj] EPSG 7.9 Upgrade in Trunk
Message-ID: <4E84185D.3040301@pobox.com>

Folks,

I have upgraded libgeotiff, PROJ.4 and GDAL with EPSG definitions regenerated
from the EPSG 7.9 database.  New "preferred datum shift selection" rules are
also in place which will give preference to 7 parameter datum shifts over
3 parameter datum shifts are also in place causing a fair amount of churn
in the definitions.

The updates are in "trunk" for each of the projects.  I plan to produce
libgeotiff and PROJ.4 release candidates soon with the new definitions
so if you think you might have objections please investigate and speak
up promptly.

Best regards,

Hi,

as per
  https://trac.osgeo.org/proj/ticket/122
and 
  https://trac.osgeo.org/grass/ticket/1452  [*]

pre-selecting datum transform terms on our behalf, while at the
same time removing all indication of what the +datum originally
was, really fouls things up for GRASS, and more locally for all
us EPSG file users in New Zealand, where tectonic shear from
the west coast to the east is on the order of about 4cm/year
over a distance of hundred km or so & the choice in the matter
has a rather big impact on our results / it's good to be forced
to specify which flavor your dealing with.

Ideally, for datums known to the osgeo stack I'd beg for the
+datum term be reinstated and that datum transform terms not be
decided on our behalf, with no way to back out of the pre-
selected choice.

More generally it means we can't really use the epsg file as a
semi-authoritative source of what some given epsg code refers
to anymore. :-(


--
ignoring my argument that it isn't really possible/a good idea,
and just assuming that it is possible to choose between 7-term
vs. 3-term vs. grid file as the sensible default, it is my
understanding that the 7-term solutions are in general only
valid (respected?) in a much smaller geographic area than the
3-term ones. aka 7-term does not necessarily mean more correct,
and if the epsg code covers a wide area, in much of the region
a locale-specific 7-term solution would be the worse choice
than a less precise 3-term solution. ISTR that Cliff(??) had
published an article about this paradox some time ago.
 


thanks,
Hamish
