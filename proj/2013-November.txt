Subject: [Proj] How many principal digits on line labels for MGRS or USNG
	grids?
Message-ID: <E4AB3DD44D22854B819908379DE4AD493959D339@SETHNWS023.carmenta.se>

Hello.

I have a question about MGRS or USNG grid line labels, and how many principal digits should be used.



The background is that the line label is based on the UTM easting or northing for the line, which is a 6-digit or

7-digit number. But only the five last digits would be used in MGRS or USNG notation, so the fifth digit from the

end is the first principal digit, and is written with a larger font than the leading or trailing digits. So far, so good.



Here is my confusion. In the Military Map Reading 201, http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/coordsys/mmr201.pdf ,

examples show that when the grid line spacing is 10 000 m, there is one principal digit in each line label,

and when the grid line spacing is 1 000 m, there is two principal digit in each label. There are no examples
for larger scale maps, but my extrapolation has been that there would be three principal digits when the line
spacing is 100 m, four principal digits when the line spacing is 10 m, and five principal digits when the line
spacing is 1 m. (The basic idea is that the trailing digits are all zeros, with as many trailing digits as possible.)



However, I recently found a style guide for USNG (which is nearly identical to MGRS),

http://www.floridadisaster.org/gis/usng/Documents/USNG_style_sheetV1-11plus.pdf ,

which simply says that there are always two principal digits in a line label. Examples are given for

many line spacings, including 10 000 m. (The basic idea must be that when reading the principal digits

as a number, you get a value in kilometers.)



The two documents clearly contradict each other for the case with 10 000 m line spacing. But I am

not sure if my extrapolation of the military convention to dense line spacing is correct - maybe the

military convention is to have one or two principal digits, but never more than that.



I would like to get comments or opinions on this, since I am currently working with MGRS grid visualization.



Best regards,

Well, it is true that the USNG style guide is just a draft, but the following paragraph is from the established USNG standard:

C.1.7.1 Principal digits.
The 10,000-meter and 1,000-meter digits are known as the principal digits and identify USNG grid lines. Preceding and following UTM digits are shown as superscript. Alternatively, only the principal digits for grid lines need be shown, but a sample full UTM value for both the Easting and Northing axis must be depicted at least once on the map, usually near the southeast corner.
http://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/usng/fgdc_std_011_2001_usng.pdf

So that is exactly two principal digits, regardless of line spacing. (Another thing: I'm not sure if this paragraph allows discarding the final zeros of the UTM digits that come after the principal digits. For example, if the line spacing is 100 m, then the small digits after the principal ones would be 000, 100, 200, ..., or 900, but the style guide would only display 0, 1, 2, ..., or 9 after the principal ones, and discard the two final zeros. This practice is not mentioned in the USNG standard itself, as far as I can see.)

According to "Datums, Ellipsoids, Grids, and Grid Reference Systems", DMA Technical Manual 8358.1, military map grids don't have line spacing denser than 1000 m. But that's a fairly old document.

My problem is also that style guides for printed maps don't always fit GIS systems well.

Subject: [Proj] Search directory for grid shift files
Message-ID: <527B63A6.2070201@sourcepole.ch>

Hi

I'm trying to implement support for datum transformations with grid 
shift files into the QGIS gui. For better useability, I would like to 
check if a shift file for a datum transformation is present (and if not, 
give a hint to the user where to put the .gsb file).
Is there a way to find out the search directory for grid shift files? I 
see in the API doc there is a method pj_set_searchpath, however I cannot 
find one to read the path. What is the best approach to get the search path?


Thank you for any hint,
Marco****

Marco,

PROJ is not really setup to make this available, and it is complicated by
the fact that there are several search rules.  With PROJ 4.8 you could sort
of accomplish this by setting a custom file open function on the context
and then seeing where gets probed for but that is ugly and it is hard to
know which of the probe locations is ideal.  It also would only work for
this very recent version.

In some situations the PROJ_LIB environment variable may be set, and you
could use that.

Just checking for the "usual places" such as /usr/share/proj or
/usr/local/share/proj on unix systems might go quite a long ways.

One suggestion, in the QGIS context might be that you keep them in some
sort of QGIS subtree, and use pj_set_searchpath() to check there.  The
downside of this approach is that other applications on the systems
(including things run as subprocesses of QGIS) won't see the files.

Best regards,
Frank

Hi Frank

Thank you for the advice. The PROJ_LIB variable seems to be set at least 
on windows, so that's already a good thing to check.

 >One suggestion, in the QGIS context might be that you keep them in 
some sort of QGIS subtree, and use pj_set_searchpath() to check there

Does the pj_set_searchpath add an additional search path or does it also 
override the default path? If it adds, having a dedicated subdirectory 
sounds good.

Regards,
Marco

It is actually a definition by ESRI:
<http://spatialreference.org/ref/esri/102092/>

and we all know that they keep datum shifts always seperately from 
projection definitions.

I don't understand why QGIS 2.0 (and GDAL 1.10.0) simply calls them EPSG.
QGIS 1.8.0 Lisboa did not know those codes, and they named French 
definitions IGNF:...

I would like to see those ESRI definitions marked ESRI:... to flag the 
difference.

** added mailing lists for proj.4 and gdal as it comes probably from there

Marco,

It actually replaces the search path, but in normal operation the "search
path" is the last thing checked, after all the other rules (ie. PROJ_LIB,
install location, custom pj_finder, etc) have been exhausted.  So calling
it within QGIS won't do any harm since nothing else will have set a search
path.
