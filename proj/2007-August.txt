	transformations

Daan--

Thanks for taking the time to reply. When I added my most recent message 
before this one, I just posted it without checking the list archives. If I'd 
checked the archives first, my most recent message and this reply would have 
been combined in one message.

Sure, a lot of people are interested in the relative areas of the zones of 
spatial-distribution maps (which I call "data maps", for short), just as 
some people want to easily measure where the zone boundaries are. The 
azimuthal equal area data maps suit the former people, but certainly don't 
suit the latter people. But the sinusoidal projection offers easy geographic 
co-ordinate determinations and also has the equal-area property., and 
doesn�t misrepresent distances and directions so badly even on world maps, 
when the map is interrupted.

Maybe I want to find out if a particular camping or hiking area is inside 
the range zone of a certain species of animal or tree. The areas of those 
range-zones could be important to a biologist or conservation  manager, but 
not to the person who just wants to know what species they�re likely to run 
into.

Sure, the boundaries aren�t really precise, but, as I was saying, why 
increase the uncertainty by adding position-guessing error?

The data maps I�m referring to include all the spatial distribution maps in 
atlases, and the species range maps in nature guidebooks.

I didn�t  mean the tropical, temperate and arctic zones so much as the finer 
divisions that tell the particular kind of forest, according to the species 
of trees found there. But also of interest are temperature and rainfall 
distributions with relatively fine divisions. And population distributions, 
etc.

I don�t run into data maps of  regions smaller than a U.S. state, or a 
country, but I�d be interested in them if I found them.

Some map projections can offer ease of determining geographic co-ordinates, 
and still offer one or more of the other properties that you listed. The 
equal area property of the sinusoidal is one example. The good route 
distances on local projections such as an equidistant conic, and the 
accurately calculable route distances and accurate directions on conformal 
conic maps are other examples. Someone could calculate route distances as 
accurately as they want to on a Mercator map too, of course. Though latitude 
determinations aren�t as easy on those conformal projections as the are on 
an equidistant projection, they�re a lot easier than they�d be on an 
azimuthal equal area projection (with unspecified center) or a polyconic or 
a Chamberlain trimetric.

Though the graduated equidistant projections fall short of conformality, 
they approximate it to some degree. To the extent that they do, route 
distances can be calculated accurately and directions are accurate.

As for the relative importance of those different kinds of measurements, it 
would be nice if the data map could double as a hiking map that gives 
usefully accurate route distances and directions. But if the data map 
doesn�t offer those properties, then the USGS sells maps that do. So I don�t 
demand those other  properties from a data map, even though it could be 
convenient to have them in the same map. One thing that I do expect from a 
data map: I expect it to tell me where those zone boundaries are. Then there 
are other maps that can give me any route distances and any directions that 
I need. But if the date map _doesn�t_ give me that information (without 
prohibitively much calculation work), no other map is going to.

Of course great-circle or loxodrome directions and distances can be 
calculated from the geographical co-ordinates of the relevant points.

Yes, what I�m talking about is the need for easy and accurate conversion 
from map co-ordinates to geographic co-ordinates. It doesn�t always have to 
be either/or, since some projections combine properties. But, when the 
different goals conflict, I ask that the data map do the one thing that no 
other map will do for me--tell me easily where its zone boundaries are.

Subject: [Proj] Optimizing lookup of init files
Message-ID: <46B0AB80.5090109@mapgears.com>

Hi,

Users of applications such as MapServer that make use of the 
"+init=epsg:4326" type of syntax to initialize projection definitions 
have reported a performance issue when their maps contain multiple 
projections (see http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/1976).

After discussing the issue with Frank it seems that the best fix would 
be to implement caching in the get_init(), get_defaults(), and get_opt() 
functions which manage access to initialization files for +init 
statements and for defaults.

Unfortunately implementing caching in a static data structure could 
introduce some multi-threading issues for some applications. There are 
two possible ways to handle this in a thread-safe way and I would like 
to get your opinion on which one you think is best:


Option 1:
---------

Implement multi-threaded locking support to protect the blocks of code 
that deal with the cache. We would likely do this using a copy of the 
code from MapServer's mapthread.c/.h which supports Linux (Pthreads) and 
Windows and has been tested and is known to work on several platforms. 
For more details on this option see the documentation starting at line 
30 in mapthread.c:
http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/browser/trunk/mapserver/mapthread.c


Option 2:
---------

Create the concept of a pj_session data structure in which we maintain 
the cache and can which be easily extended later on to contain any 
relevant information that needs to persist between various calls to the 
PROJ API.

Then we could create a pj_init_ex.c with
   pj_init_ex(pj_session *, int argc, char **argv)
which calls get_init_ex(), etc...

To maintain backwards compatibility, the existing pj_init() and family 
would simply be calls to the pj_..._ex() equivalent with a NULL session 
handle. If the session handle is NULL then no caching happens.

The pj_session object would be created and freed using 
pj_session_create() and pj_session_destroy() by the calling application 
if it cares to take advantage of caching and other persistent features.


There are pros and cons to both approaches. Can anyone think of a 3rd 
option that would be even less disruptive?

Comments and suggestions welcome. I'm especially interested in feedback 
from developers of applications using PROJ.

Thanks in advance

Daniel

I wrongly impllied that the sinusoidal is good on directions and route 
distances. It holds its own as a world map because interruption is accepted 
for world maps. But no one wants an interrupted map of a country, province 
or state.

Because it concentrates its distortion in the corners, and because it's an 
equatorially centered, rather than locally centered, projection, the 
sinusoidal won't do well compared to other projections when it isn't 
interrupted. And its directions and route distances aren't easily 
calculated.

But then I'd use a different map for directions and route distances.

Two things that can't be gotten from a different map are the depictions of 
the data zones. Their position and their area (if you want areas). The 
directions and route distances can be gotten from other maps.

Yes.  Remove the +init from proj.  That was the first thing I did when 
upgrading to libproj4 and lproj.  Seems like something more appropriate for 
mysql or other DBMS.

Sorry.  I am sure that suggestion was not appreciated but it follows my 
approach of keeping operations separated into appropriate categories.
Like datum shifting is not appropriate within the projection software element, 
extracting initialization information from a database is also not 
appropriate.

I tend to agree with Gerald on this issue.  I think maintenance of predefined coordinate systems
should be separated from the library.  It seems the coordinate systems need to be updated more
often than the actual library.

However, if you're going to add caching support and make it thread safe, you might as well fix the non-thread safe caching of grid shift files.  I recently had to abandon PROJ.4 from a project because of that.

Because of the threading problems from above, I started to look into using Gerald's new library.  After I patched that library for Windows (no atanh in math.h), I started looking at how the interface should be designed.  My initial idea is a bit different than the cs2cs model.  Basically, I decided the library should supply a set of coordinate transformations.  The transformations then can be chained to get from some system A to another system B.  It'd be up to the client to specify the set of transforms that need to be applied.

For instance:

typedef struct _transform_t transform_t;

int transform_create(const char *init, transform_t **transform);
int transform_apply(const transform_t *transform, size_t dims, double data[dims]);
void transform_destroy(transform_t **transform);

Initialization strings might be something like:
"+transform=pj_fwd +proj= ... "
"+transform=gridshit +grid=conus +direction=forward"

But, that's about as far as I got.  It's hard for me to devote any time to work on this...

The main idea was that there are many ways to transform coordinates, so the library should provide more flexibility on how to get from A to B.  A higher level interface could provide some defaults (invproj -> geodetic2geocentric -> bursa_wolf -> geocentric2geodetic -> proj).

Release of EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset v6.13  (July 16, 2007)

This release (Version 6.13) of the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset comprises
of data corrections and updates to the v6.12 release of February 2007.   The
EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset is maintained by the Geodesy Subcommittee of
the Surveying and Positioning Committee of the International Association of
Oil and Gas Producers (OGP).  This version and prior archived versions may
be downloaded without charge from www.epsg.org <http://www.epsg.org/> .. The
dataset will continue to be known as the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset.

As for previous releases, the v6.13 dataset is available in two forms:
either an MS Access database which also includes a data reporting
capability, or as a series of SQL scripts for populating an alternative
relational database application. There are different SQL scripts for various
SQL variants. In each format, the v6.13 release is accompanied by an updated
version of the current ReadMe file, in both PDF and MS Word formats. 

New to Version 6.13 are:

*         Changes as documented in Change table records through 2007.067,
but with actions still remaining on some change requests.

*         Revisions to data for Australia, Barbados, Belgium, Colombia,
Germany, Greenland, Fiji, Kuwait, Namibia, Netherlands, Reunion, South
Africa, Spain and United Kingdom.

*         New data for Canada, China, France, Germany, Indonesia, New
Caledonia, New Zealand, South Georgia, United Arab Emirates and United
States.

*         The use of the terms 'supersede', 'retire' and 'replace' has been
rationalised. This has included structural changes to the Supersession table
in which the supersession type of 'replacement' has been eliminated. The
rationalisation has also included changes to the supersession type assigned
to records within the supersession table and to remarks in records in other
tables. The EPSG dataset interpretation of ISO 19135 terms is discussed in
Guidance Note 7 part  <http://www.epsg.org/guides/G7-1.html> 1 - Use of the
EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset.

In addition to the above data content changes, the "Use of the Data" rules
have been clarified and expanded to facilitate increased use of the EPSG
dataset in third party software.  See the Readme file or associated online
documentation for additional details.

Eric,

I agree.  If we either introduce a session object, or thread locks
this should also be used to protect the grid shift file stuff.

I'm not adverse to having the library expose individual methods so folks
can have detailed control when they want it.  But from a practical point of
view I believe that applications like MapServer, GRASS, and GDAL mostly
want to avoid micromanaging this stuff.  They want a string representation
of two coordinate systems and a function to convert coordinates from one
to the other.

This discussion is beside the point as far as Daniel's question goes though.

With regard to his two approaches, I think introducing thread locks in
PROJ.4 would not be terribly complicated. We have good models for this in
MapServer and GDAL.  But I do hate having to maintain platform stuff like
a thread locking abstraction in so many different places.

The session idea provides a nice lock-free approach with the understanding
that sessions cannot be shared between threads - at least concurrently.
*But* each session will end up with duplication of cached grids and
initialized projections.  It puts a non-trivial weight on calling
applications to keep track of sessions when there was previously no such
thing.

So, I'm personally inclined towards the internal thread locking approach,
though not strongly.

I like the route shown below.

invproj -> geodetic2geocentric -> bursa_wolf -> geocentric2geodetic -> proj

I'm currently looking at developing a tool based PROJ.4 to do something
similar (web-based possibly).

I've always thought of projections and datum transforms as two different
beasts.

In place of busra_wolfe in the above example, though, you could incorporate
the grid methods (used in South Africa, Canada, the U.S., etc.), depending
on the accuracy you are after, whether it be for mapping or more detailed
surveying.

Ideally, also, on the bursa_wolfe, you'd have to specify which specific one
particular to a region, as even in the EPSG codes, there are various ones
for various parts of countries or states and even offshore. The accuracies
range from being very poor (very few survey points to be adjusted) to very
good for a small area (many survey points used to determine the rotations,
scale factor, translations).

Cheers,
Dean

Folks,

I have already processed this new dataset for libgeotiff.  With this
release of the EPSG dataset there is an effort to cleanup licensing
issues.  The OGP/EPSG folks are requiring that modified forms of the
dataset not be called EPSG so for libgeotiff I seperated out the
"overrides" for stuff like datum shifts into distinct files so the
EPSG dataset is unaltered.

However, it isn't obvious to me how to do the same for PROJ.4 since
folks are expect to get those modification in the "epsg" init file.

I'm thinking of implementing an include mechanism so the epsg init
file can include an not-epsg-overrides init file and then include
the real-epsg file.  This should help make it clear what coordinate
systems are representative of EPSG and which are locally modified.

Thoughts on good approaches would be appreciated (as long as they
aren't that we shouldn't have init files). :-)

> If you have any questions about their use and datums and projections,

I'd add that folks interested in datums and projections in general and
with PROJ should try to attend the "Datums, Coordinate Systems, Map
Projections & Datum Transformations" hands on lab at FOSS4G 2007.  It
will be presented by Dean with some support from me.

Message-ID: <46B100E5.2060409@playaoil.com>

I use Arcview to plot point locations which I receive originally in 
NAD27 lat lon. I use Arcview to reproject the value into State Plane 
FIPS 3301 which is North Dakota North NAD27. Arcview lists it as:

Projected Coordinate System: 
NAD_1927_StatePlane_North_Dakota_North_FIPS_3301
Projection: Lambert_Conformal_Conic
False_Easting: 2000000.00000000
False_Northing: 0.00000000
Central_Meridian: -100.50000000
Standard_Parallel_1: 47.43333333
Standard_Parallel_2: 48.73333333
Latitude_Of_Origin: 47.00000000
Linear Unit: Foot_US

I am trying to use cs2cs to duplicate this process. In short my 
latitudes are spot on but my longitudes are way off.

My input values are: -104.0486 +45.7912
In Arcview I get: 1094396.195 -420136.44
Using cs2cs I get: 5656062.96 -420136.44

Here is my script:

#!/bin/bash

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=NAD27 \
+to +datum=NAD27 +units=us-ft +proj=lcc \
+lat_0=+47.000000 \
+lat_1=+47.433333 \
+lat_2=+48.733333 \
+lon_0=-100.500000 \
+x_0=2000000 \
+y_0=0.000000 \
<<EOF
-104.0486 +45.7912
EOF

I have tried may things such as changing the input and script to DMS 
values with no change.
I have also tried a completely new set of input values with the same 
results.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Larry,

I believe the issue is that PROJ expects the x_0 in meters regardless of
the units of the coordinate system.  Try +x_0=609601.22 instead of 2000000.
I then get the right results.

Best regards,

Mike,

I have a better idea of where you're coming from now. I see your need, more 
or less, though you seem more interested in precise coordinate inversion than I 
really see the need for. You don't see more maps on the projections you 
describe because not many people share your priorities.

Be careful not to get too cavalier about the other traits. It's very uncommon 
for a map projection to satisfy two metric criteria simultaneously. You may 
mean that you can get good "enough" distance measurements even wit your 
"graduated" equidistant, but good "enough" for you might not be good enough for 
someone else. You certainly can't get the best distance measurements AND the 
equidistant property simultaneously.

I don't think there's a lot more I have to say here. I'll be traveling for 
awhile, so I can't respond in any case.

Regards,

I reply:

Yes, and that�s why the sinusoidal projection is so remarkable. It�s 
equidistant and it�s equal-area.
And not just equidistant. Not only are the parallels truly-spaced and 
uniformly divided, but they�re all truly divided.

We�ve discussed two desiderata for a data map: I�ve mentioned the 
desirability of feasibly, hopefully easily,  finding out if a particular 
place is within a certain zone on the map. What good is a data map if you 
can�t determine that? You mentioned that people expect a data map to be 
equal-area.  Ok, the sinusoidal has both of those desired properties.

As the price for those properties, the sinusoidal doesn�t do well by scale 
variation, distances, and directions (unless it�s a world map, because 
interruption is accepted for world maps).

But how fair is it to judge a data map according to how well it works as 
navigational map? It isn�t a navigational map. It�s a special purpose map 
for showing _where_ certain spatial distribution zones are.

For example, the gnomonic projection too is a special purpose projection, 
for showing great circles as straight lines. No one criticizes the gnomonic 
for not being a good source of accurate distances, directions or areas. They 
don�t, because they know that that is not what it�s for. Likewise for a 
spatial distribution map.

The hiker isn�t going to depend on an atlas rainfall-distribution map or a 
species range map in a nature guidebook to determine the distances and 
directions that s/he needs. How far is the rare salamander habitat from the 
trailhead, and what heading should the compass be set for? S/he�ll find that 
out from another map, probably a USGS topographic map.

Does a botanist or wildlife biologist want to know how wide a habitat range 
is, or its distance from the nearest river or lake? For one thing, I 
question whether s/he�ll need that more often than s/he�ll need to know the 
position of the habitat range�s boundaries. And, when s/he needs that, and 
has gotten some lat/long co-ordinates from an equidistant projection, then 
s/he can calculate the distance, or get it from a map better suited for that 
than is a little atlas or guidebook range map.

And does a botanist or wildlife biologist really need to get that 
information from a little distribution map in a public-consumption atlas or 
nature guidebook purchased in a bookstore?

It�s difficult to find a scenario in which someone needs accurate distances 
from an atlas spatial distribution map or a nature guidebook species range 
map. But what makes those maps unique is that they tell where those zones 
are, and I�m merely asking that they do so _usably_.

You wrote:

property simultaneously.

I reply:

Well, for the most accurate distances, you can calculate them as accurately 
as you want to  from a conformal map. That�s more feasible with a conformal 
because, at any particular point, the scale is the same in ever direction.

But if you�re referring to distances measured directly from the map, without 
being corrected for scale in its part of the map, I don�t know that 
equidistant maps do worse. The sinusoidal, Bonne, and Stabius-Werner have 
more scale variation because they concentrate their distortion in the 
corners. And the sinusoidal more so, because it�s an equatorially-centered 
map, rather than a locally-centered map.

But, considering for instance the conic projections, the equidistant doesn�t 
do badly in comparison to the other conics. The equal area conic has more 
scale variation than the equidistant or the conformal. If the parallel with 
the largest east-west scale has 1.1 times the east-west scale of the 
parallel with the smallest east-west scale, then, to make up for that and 
maintain equal area, that first parallel must have 1.1 times _less_ 
north-south scale, in comparison to the second parallel. Resulting in a 
maximum scale variation factor of 1.21 instead of just 1.1   Equal area maps 
square the maximum scale variation factor. They do _worst_ by the standard 
of scale-variation. And equal area maps are the ones that cartographers like 
for data maps.

Equidistant conic has pretty much the same scale variation as conformal 
conic. But if the equidistant conic spaces its parallels truly, then its 
typical, average distances, measured according to its official scale, will 
be more accurate than on the conformal, because typically the distances on 
the equidistant conic will have some north-south component, and that�s the 
direction in which scale is true.

So, in that regard, equidistant looks best, and equal area looks worst.

And, as I said, after getting two points� lat and long co-ordinates from an 
equidistant projection, you can calculate accurate great circle distances 
and directions. More accurate than you could measure directly from any map. 
On no map are distances always accurate. But they are when you calculate 
them from the accurate lat/long co-ordinates that you get from an 
equidistant map.

Of course, if distances, including route distances, were the important 
thing, then the conformal maps would, because route distances can be 
calculate on a conformal as accurately as you want to.

Anyway, it seems to me that the sinusoidal is what satisfies the person who 
is interested in the areas of the zones, and also the person who is 
interested in _where_ the zone boundaries are.

Sometimes it seems as if cartographers regard data maps as just general 
purpose maps on which zones have been drawn, and therefore want them to have 
the same properties that they look for in general purpose maps. Atlases 
often use, for data maps, the same projection that they use for their 
general purpose maps.

It seems to me that the sinusoidal is the projection that would please 
everyone, accurately and conveniently giving the two kinds of information 
that people actually need, want, and use on a data map.

I understand that, for instance, course-instructors might want spatial 
distribution maps that show their students how the total area of the Earth�s 
boreal forest compares to that of the tropical rainforest, etc.

You wrote:

people share your priorities.

I reply:

I certainly can�t argue with that.

I guess sinusoidal isn�t going to become widely used for data maps, because 
cartographers apply general-purpose requirements to those special purpose 
maps.

I�m the first to admit that I�m the only person I�m aware of who has 
expressed the preferences that I�ve been expressing here.

So then what would be a more realistic request for me to make to the 
publishers of atlases and nature guidebooks? I�d ask them to at least avoid 
the azimuthal equal-area projection. Or, if they must use it, then at least 
state, somewhere, the X,Y map co-ordinates, and the lat/long co-ordinates, 
of the projection�s center. If they don�t want to write it on the map page, 
the could have it on part of one page of an appendix. So that someone could 
find the position of zone boundaries without having to first solve a system 
of five simultaneous nonlinear equations to find the projection�s center and 
orientation.

I�d ask them to avoid the polyconic too. It isn�t that the polyconic is more 
difficult than other projections. It�s that it has no properties, has 
nothing to justify its use for a data map.

The polyconic is often used to map the U.S. But it�s the wrong projection 
for a country of east-west extent.

Better yet, to make the request more complete, I�d recommend that publishers 
only use the following kinds of projections for data maps:

Cylindrical, conic, polar azimuthal (and maybe oblique azimuthal if they 
tell the map�s center position [in map co-ordinates and lat/long 
co-ordinates] and the map�s orientation about that center), and 
pseudocylindrical.

Well, usually the only major offender is the azimuthal equal area map, 
without the information that should go with it. If it weren�t for that one, 
I might not have posted these messages.

But this list is proof that I�m not the only person who is interested in 
co-ordinate transformations and considers them important, and wants ways of 
making them more feasible. In fact just the other day, on this list, there 
was discussion about software for transforming from the azimuthal equal 
area�s map co-ordinates to lat/long co-ordinates. Exactly the transformation 
that motivated me to post here, on the very projection that creates the most 
difficulty for the person who wants positions of zone boundaries on a data 
map. But how would you like it if you had to solve a system of five 
simultaneous nonlinear equations, to find the position of the projection�s 
center (in both co-ordinate systems) and its orientation about that center, 
before you could begin the actual co-ordinate transformation task?

The parameters correspond to UTM zone 2, northern hemisphere. The

I hope this helps.

Save the above WKT co-ordinate system description to an ASCII file, then 
run the GRASS command:
g.proj -c location=newloc wkt=filename
where newloc is the name of the new location you wish to create and 
filename is the file you saved the co-ordinate system description to.

You could also try the -j command with g.proj to output the information in 
PROJ.4 format, if it was useful. Seeing this was a GRASS question I've 
given a GRASS answer. It doesn't really belong on the PROJ list...

Michael,

The sinusoidal is not equidistant by any standard definition. Equally spaced parallels are a necessary condition for equidistance, but not sufficient. Constant scale along parallels is not related to equidistance because parallels are not great circles. The shortest path between two points on a parallel is never the parallel itself unless the parallel is the equator. It is constant scale along meridians, combined with straight meridians, that defines equidistance. The sinusoidal fulfills neither criterion.

Your post is quite long. I can't really get into a whack-a-mole game of responding to each of your points only to have several more spring up in their places. I will just note that I don't seem to have the trouble you have in determining geographic coordinates on a map as long as the map comes with a graticule. On a medium-scale map (a whole state, for instance) it's easy enough to arrive a lat/long coordinate accurate to a few seconds' accuracy in a minute or two. It just takes two measurements and a short calculation. That's FAR easier than trying to correct for the projection's vagaries in assessing distances, whether the map is conformal or not.

Regards,

You wrote: 
 

It's very uncommon for a map projection to satisfy two metric criteria 
simultaneously. 
 

I reply: 
 

Yes, and that’s why the sinusoidal projection is so remarkable. It’s 
equidistant and it’s equal-area. 

And not just equidistant. Not only are the parallels truly-spaced and 
uniformly divided, but they’re all truly divided. 
 

We’ve discussed two desiderata for a data map: I’ve mentioned the 
desirability of feasibly, hopefully easily,  finding out if a particular 
place is within a certain zone on the map. What good is a data map if you 
can’t determine that? You mentioned that people expect a data map to be 
equal-area.  Ok, the sinusoidal has both of those desired properties. 
 

As the price for those properties, the sinusoidal doesn’t do well by scale 
variation, distances, and directions (unless it’s a world map, because 
interruption is accepted for world maps). 
 

But how fair is it to judge a data map according to how well it works as 
navigational map? It isn’t a navigational map. It’s a special purpose map 
for showing _where_ certain spatial distribution zones are. 
 

For example, the gnomonic projection too is a special purpose projection, 
for showing great circles as straight lines. No one criticizes the gnomonic 
for not being a good source of accurate distances, directions or areas. They 
don’t, because they know that that is not what it’s for. Likewise for a 
spatial distribution map. 
 

The hiker isn’t going to depend on an atlas rainfall-distribution map or a 
species range map in a nature guidebook to determine the distances and 
directions that s/he needs. How far is the rare salamander habitat from the 
trailhead, and what heading should the compass be set for? S/he’ll find that 
out from another map, probably a USGS topographic map. 
 

Does a botanist or wildlife biologist want to know how wide a habitat range 
is, or its distance from the nearest river or lake? For one thing, I 
question whether s/he’ll need that more often than s/he’ll need to know the 
position of the habitat range’s boundaries. And, when s/he needs that, and 
has gotten some lat/long co-ordinates from an equidistant projection, then 
s/he can calculate the distance, or get it from a map better suited for that 
than is a little atlas or guidebook range map. 
 

And does a botanist or wildlife biologist really need to get that 
information from a little distribution map in a public-consumption atlas or 
nature guidebook purchased in a bookstore? 
 

It’s difficult to find a scenario in which someone needs accurate distances 
from an atlas spatial distribution map or a nature guidebook species range 
map. But what makes those maps unique is that they tell where those zones 
are, and I’m merely asking that they do so _usably_. 
 

You wrote: 
 

You certainly can't get the best distance measurements AND the equidistant 
property simultaneously. 
 

I reply: 
 

Well, for the most accurate distances, you can calculate them as accurately 
as you want to  from a conformal map. That’s more feasible with a conformal 
because, at any particular point, the scale is the same in ever direction. 
 

But if you’re referring to distances measured directly from the map, without 
being corrected for scale in its part of the map, I don’t know that 
equidistant maps do worse. The sinusoidal, Bonne, and Stabius-Werner have 
more scale variation because they concentrate their distortion in the 
corners. And the sinusoidal more so, because it’s an equatorially-centered 
map, rather than a locally-centered map. 
 

But, considering for instance the conic projections, the equidistant doesn’t 
do badly in comparison to the other conics. The equal area conic has more 
scale variation than the equidistant or the conformal. If the parallel with 
the largest east-west scale has 1.1 times the east-west scale of the 
parallel with the smallest east-west scale, then, to make up for that and 
maintain equal area, that first parallel must have 1.1 times _less_ 
north-south scale, in comparison to the second parallel. Resulting in a 
maximum scale variation factor of 1.21 instead of just 1.1   Equal area maps 
square the maximum scale variation factor. They do _worst_ by the standard 
of scale-variation. And equal area maps are the ones that cartographers like 
for data maps. 
 

Equidistant conic has pretty much the same scale variation as conformal 
conic. But if the equidistant conic spaces its parallels truly, then its 
typical, average distances, measured according to its official scale, will 
be more accurate than on the conformal, because typically the distances on 
the equidistant conic will have some north-south component, and that’s the 
direction in which scale is true. 
 

So, in that regard, equidistant looks best, and equal area looks worst. 
 

And, as I said, after getting two points’ lat and long co-ordinates from an 
equidistant projection, you can calculate accurate great circle distances 
and directions. More accurate than you could measure directly from any map. 
On no map are distances always accurate. But they are when you calculate 
them from the accurate lat/long co-ordinates that you get from an 
equidistant map. 
 

Of course, if distances, including route distances, were the important 
thing, then the conformal maps would, because route distances can be 
calculate on a conformal as accurately as you want to. 
 

Anyway, it seems to me that the sinusoidal is what satisfies the person who 
is interested in the areas of the zones, and also the person who is 
interested in _where_ the zone boundaries are. 
 

Sometimes it seems as if cartographers regard data maps as just general 
purpose maps on which zones have been drawn, and therefore want them to have 
the same properties that they look for in general purpose maps. Atlases 
often use, for data maps, the same projection that they use for their 
general purpose maps. 
 

It seems to me that the sinusoidal is the projection that would please 
everyone, accurately and conveniently giving the two kinds of information 
that people actually need, want, and use on a data map. 
 

I understand that, for instance, course-instructors might want spatial 
distribution maps that show their students how the total area of the Earth’s 
boreal forest compares to that of the tropical rainforest, etc. 
 

You wrote: 
 

You don't see more maps on the projections you describe because not many 
people share your priorities. 
 

I reply: 
 

I certainly can’t argue with that. 
 

I guess sinusoidal isn’t going to become widely used for data maps, because 
cartographers apply general-purpose requirements to those special purpose 
maps. 
 

I’m the first to admit that I’m the only person I’m aware of who has 
expressed the preferences that I’ve been expressing here. 
 

So then what would be a more realistic request for me to make to the 
publishers of atlases and nature guidebooks? I’d ask them to at least avoid 
the azimuthal equal-area projection. Or, if they must use it, then at least 
state, somewhere, the X,Y map co-ordinates, and the lat/long co-ordinates, 
of the projection’s center. If they don’t want to write it on the map page, 
the could have it on part of one page of an appendix. So that someone could 
find the position of zone boundaries without having to first solve a system 
of five simultaneous nonlinear equations to find the projection’s center and 
orientation. 
 

I’d ask them to avoid the polyconic too. It isn’t that the polyconic is more 
difficult than other projections. It’s that it has no properties, has 
nothing to justify its use for a data map. 
 

The polyconic is often used to map the U.S. But it’s the wrong projection 
for a country of east-west extent. 
 

Better yet, to make the request more complete, I’d recommend that publishers 
only use the following kinds of projections for data maps: 
 

Cylindrical, conic, polar azimuthal (and maybe oblique azimuthal if they 
tell the map’s center position [in map co-ordinates and lat/long 
co-ordinates] and the map’s orientation about that center), and 
pseudocylindrical. 
 

Well, usually the only major offender is the azimuthal equal area map, 
without the information that should go with it. If it weren’t for that one, 
I might not have posted these messages. 
 

But this list is proof that I’m not the only person who is interested in 
co-ordinate transformations and considers them important, and wants ways of 
making them more feasible. In fact just the other day, on this list, there 
was discussion about software for transforming from the azimuthal equal 
area’s map co-ordinates to lat/long co-ordinates. Exactly the transformation 
that motivated me to post here, on the very projection that creates the most 
difficulty for the person who wants positions of zone boundaries on a data 
map. But how would you like it if you had to solve a system of five 
simultaneous nonlinear equations, to find the position of the projection’s 
center (in both co-ordinate systems) and its orientation about that center, 
before you could begin the actual co-ordinate transformation task?

I reply:

Ok, I'd just assumed that equidance just meant equidistantly-spaced 
parallels. Though all the projections I've heard called by that name have 
straight meridians too, I didn't know that was also a requirement.

But that doesn't really change anything with respect to what I said in my 
previous posting.

Equidistant or not, the sinusoidal makes it easy to find lat/long for a 
particular point on the map. That's what I was interested in and was talking 
about. Sure, the measurement is easiest of all if both the parallels and 
meridians are straight.

And the definition of equidistance doesn't change the fact that it's 
difficult to come up with a scenario in which someone needs to directly 
measure accurate distances from a range map in a nature guidebook or an 
atlas data map.

To clarify my preferences, I personally would prefer graduated cylindrical 
equidistant for data maps, but I understand that some want equal area for 
some kinds of data, such as forest-type or land-use.
Sinusoidal is a compromise for that.

But 'm willing to work for position information on a data map, which is why 
an incompletely-specified azimuthal equal area data map is the only one that 
I seriously object to, when speaking for myself.  But most map users don't 
want to do calculating work to find positions--other than linear 
interpolation. For them, something like the sinusoidal, or equidistant maps, 
including graduated equidistant, would be the only way they'd get good  
position information from a data map. How many people around the world are 
trying to linearly interpolate positions from azimuthal equal area data 
maps?

In your postings, you�ve told why you consider accurate distances to be 
important, and you said, �You certainly can�t get the best distance 
measurements and the equidistant property simultaneously.�

But, for conic, azimuthal and cylindrical maps, equal-area projections 
typically have about twice as much percentage scale variation as do 
equidistant projections or conformal projections.

So your statement could be answered, ��but you certainly can get better 
distance measurements with equidistant projections than with equal-area 
projections.�

You said that data maps should be equal-area, and that you want the most 
accurate directly-measured distances. You want two goals that are mutually 
incompatible.

In your most recent posting, you say:

�Your post is quite long. I can't really get into a whack-a-mole game of 
responding to each of your points only to have several more spring up in 
their places.�

Actually there were only a few �points� in my posting (some were 
considerately accompanied by clarification-examples), and each �point� was a 
direct answer to one of your main objections to what I had said. .

1. I answered you statement that equidistant projections don�t give the best 
distances, where you were referring to distances measured directly from the 
map (No, they only give the best such distances when compared to those of 
equal-area and conformal projections).

2. When you said that it�s very uncommon for a map projection to satisfy two 
metric criteria simultaneously, I pointed out that the sinusoidal does, 
because it�s equal-area, and it gives accurate and easy directly-measured 
lat/long co-ordinates. Accurate directly-measured lat/long positions are a 
�metric criterion� no less than is equal-area.

3. When you kept complaining that the data map projections that I was 
suggesting don�t give the best directly-measured distances,  I pointed out 
that it isn�t reasonable to judge a data map by how good a navigational map 
it is. I pointed out that it�s difficult to find a scenario in which someone 
needs accurate directly-measured distances from a nature guidebook range-map 
or a rainfall-distribution map in an atlas. No one wants or needs accurate 
directly-measured distances from those special purpose maps. Their only 
purpose, their whole point, is to show where their zones are.

But, aside from that, an equidistant conic does very well by directly 
measured distances. Equidistant conic was one of my data map suggestions, 
though it wasn�t my first choice.

4. Lastly, I said that the sinusoidal would please all data-map users, by 
easily, accurately and directly giving the two kinds of information 
(position and area) that people actually need, want and use from a data map.


Those were my �points�. I said them because I wanted to, not to get a reply. 
  Nor do I care _why_ you don�t reply to them. But it isn�t because I threw 
out a careless and seemingly unlimited chaff of �points� to beset you like 
moles popping up in your yard everywhere. As I said, they were a few direct 
answers to your main criticisms of what I had said.

I hadn�t attacked you or lowered myself to off-the-subject criticisms such 
as you resorted to.

Having said what wanted to say, it isn�t important whether or not you reply 
to it. But it�s dishonest to resort to the claim that you didn�t answer 
because my �points� were too many and too frivolous to bother with. To 
resort to that dodge, are we displaying some authority-conceit? Much better 
if you had just not replied.

You continued:

I will just note that I don't seem to have the trouble you have in 
determining geographic coordinates on a map as long as the map comes with a 
graticule.

I reply:

It�s reassuring to hear that you don�t have any trouble determining accurate 
geographical co-ordinates from an azimuthal  equal area map of a continent, 
with a widely-spaced graticule, when the projection�s center (in map 
co-ordinates and lat/long co-ordinates) and its orientation are not 
specified.

You continue:

On a medium-scale map (a whole state, for instance) it's easy enough to 
arrive a lat/long coordinate accurate to a few seconds' accuracy in a minute 
or two.

I reply:

Maps showing such a small region constitute a tiny fraction of the data maps 
published in atlases and guidebooks sold to the general public. So your 
success with state maps doesn�t help a whole lot.

You continued:

It just takes two measurements and a short calculation. That's FAR easier 
than trying to correct for the projection's vagaries in assessing distances, 
whether the map is conformal or not.

I reply:

�except that no one needs or uses accurate directly-measured distances 
gotten from a nature guidebook range map or a rainfall distribution map in 
an atlas.

 Michael,



I am not here to crush your soul. You seem a good deal more knowledgeable and interested in map projections than most, which I'm happy to see and certainly want to encourage.



On the other hand, your jargon is idiosyncratic and your analysis of the issues surrounding your thesis seem to evolve as we talk. These make it hard for me to engage you in conversation. When a person wishes to announce that the world ought to be doing things differently, then it behooves the person to exercise due diligence. That includes a rigorous analysis and vocabulary of the domain. Without both, conversation gets distracted by the parties involved just trying to figure out what the other is saying.



Since I'm the only other one participating in this discussion I have to think everyone else is long bored of it. (It's also probably off-topic by some people's assessment.) I'm not going to address each of your points. As an illustration of talking past each other in your latest post:



You write:

-----


2. When you said that it’s very uncommon for a map projection to satisfy two 
metric criteria simultaneously, I pointed out that the sinusoidal does, 
because it’s equal-area, and it gives accurate and easy directly-measured 
lat/long co-ordinates. Accurate directly-measured lat/long positions are a 
“metric criterion” no less than is equal-area. 

-----



Equal-area is a rigorous concept. "Giving accurate and easy directly-measured lat/long coordinates" is not, and it is not a "metric criterion". You have performed no rigorous studies of this property of the sinusoidal, and neither has anyone else. I could easily claim some other projection is better than sinusoidal for "accurate and easy directly-measured lat/long coordinates", and then we'd be reduced to "Yuh huh!" "Nuh uh!". If, on the other hand, I were to claim the sinusoidal is not equal-area, you could trot out the rigorous definition of equal-area and clearly demonstrate that I am wrong.



So. How ought I engage your assertion in (2)? This assertion is peripheral to your thesis, so, to me, it's whack-a-mole digression. I've chosen to engage it here as an example of why this conversation is proving difficult for me. On the other hand, since you seem earnest, I haven't wanted to just say I'm done trying.



You have brought up azimuthal equal-area several times as an example of a projection not to use for the class of maps you're interested in. That's fine, I suppose, but something of a red herring, since I never mentioned it, much less defended it. In the first place, maps are often plotted on inappropriate projections, so it would not surprise me if you have stumbled onto such a thing. But more importantly, and back to your thesis, it's not clear to me how often the cartographer shares your priorities. You may want to think of a map as one that fits your notion of a "data map", but people may be using it for many other purposes as well.



If the only purpose for the map truly is to easily determine lat/long positions, you're best off with a plate carrée, regardless of how distorted it gets as you move away from the equator. As soon as you start making concessions to other uses, well, suddenly the waters muddy a lot.  There aren't any easy answers when you compromise because suddenly everyone interested in the map wants a different balance of compromises.



You started out claiming a "graduated equidistant" is the
answer. That's already a compromise away from the "easiest"
determination of lat/long. You've now evolved to an "interrupted
sinusoidal". That's about as muddy as it gets. Many projections could be argued to provide similar compromises, or a "better" balance of those compromises [better for whom?]. And, most glaringly, how many interruptions are there, and where are they? The more interruptions, the greater the accuracy... but the less usable for any purpose that spans an  interruption.



What, then, is your thesis?



A) There is a class of maps whose primary function is to allow people to easily determine geographic coordinate. Therefore the projection must be suited to that function alone.



or



B) The primary use of ground cover maps is an easy determination of geographic coordinates of the extents of the ground cover. Therefore these maps should be drawn on the projection that makes that determination easiest.



or



C) Ground cover maps serve several functions. The most important is an easy determination of geographic coordinate, but allowances must be made for other uses.



or



D) Something else.



If (A), "the" solution is plate carrée. If (B), the solution is plate carrée. If (C)... well... that would be a fine subject for a professional paper. It would have to include use cases; relative preponderances of those cases in the real world; identifying the compromises involved; identifying projections that address those compromises; and then analysis of how well each projection addresses each need. Presumably this would also include studies of how efficiently and accurately people can measure geographic coordinates on each projection.



If (D), then I am completely lost, and I must apologize for not following your arguments well.

Subject: Re: Graduated equidistant projections for convenient co-ordinate transformations













In your postings, you’ve told why you consider accurate distances to be 
important, and you said, “You certainly can’t get the best distance 
measurements and the equidistant property simultaneously.” 

 


But, for conic, azimuthal and cylindrical maps, equal-area projections 
typically have about twice as much percentage scale variation as do 
equidistant projections or conformal projections. 

 


So your statement could be answered, “…but you certainly can get better 
distance measurements with equidistant projections than with equal-area 
projections.” 

 


You said that data maps should be equal-area, and that you want the most 
accurate directly-measured distances. You want two goals that are mutually 
incompatible. 

 


In your most recent posting, you say: 

 


“Your post is quite long. I can't really get into a whack-a-mole game of 
responding to each of your points only to have several more spring up in 
their places.” 

 


Actually there were only a few “points” in my posting (some were 
considerately accompanied by clarification-examples), and each “point” was a 
direct answer to one of your main objections to what I had said. . 

 


1. I answered you statement that equidistant projections don’t give the best 
distances, where you were referring to distances measured directly from the 
map (No, they only give the best such distances when compared to those of 
equal-area and conformal projections). 

 


2. When you said that it’s very uncommon for a map projection to satisfy two 
metric criteria simultaneously, I pointed out that the sinusoidal does, 
because it’s equal-area, and it gives accurate and easy directly-measured 
lat/long co-ordinates. Accurate directly-measured lat/long positions are a 
“metric criterion” no less than is equal-area. 

 


3. When you kept complaining that the data map projections that I was 
suggesting don’t give the best directly-measured distances,  I pointed out 
that it isn’t reasonable to judge a data map by how good a navigational map 
it is. I pointed out that it’s difficult to find a scenario in which someone 
needs accurate directly-measured distances from a nature guidebook range-map 
or a rainfall-distribution map in an atlas. No one wants or needs accurate 
directly-measured distances from those special purpose maps. Their only 
purpose, their whole point, is to show where their zones are. 

 


But, aside from that, an equidistant conic does very well by directly 
measured distances. Equidistant conic was one of my data map suggestions, 
though it wasn’t my first choice. 

 


4. Lastly, I said that the sinusoidal would please all data-map users, by 
easily, accurately and directly giving the two kinds of information 
(position and area) that people actually need, want and use from a data map. 

 



Those were my “points”. I said them because I wanted to, not to get a reply. 
 Nor do I care _why_ you don’t reply to them. But it isn’t because I threw 
out a careless and seemingly unlimited chaff of “points” to beset you like 
moles popping up in your yard everywhere. As I said, they were a few direct 
answers to your main criticisms of what I had said. 

 


I hadn’t attacked you or lowered myself to off-the-subject criticisms such 
as you resorted to. 

 


Having said what wanted to say, it isn’t important whether or not you reply 
to it. But it’s dishonest to resort to the claim that you didn’t answer 
because my “points” were too many and too frivolous to bother with. To 
resort to that dodge, are we displaying some authority-conceit? Much better 
if you had just not replied. 

 


You continued: 

 


I will just note that I don't seem to have the trouble you have in 
determining geographic coordinates on a map as long as the map comes with a 
graticule. 

 


I reply: 

 


It’s reassuring to hear that you don’t have any trouble determining accurate 
geographical co-ordinates from an azimuthal  equal area map of a continent, 
with a widely-spaced graticule, when the projection’s center (in map 
co-ordinates and lat/long co-ordinates) and its orientation are not 
specified. 

 


You continue: 

 


On a medium-scale map (a whole state, for instance) it's easy enough to 
arrive a lat/long coordinate accurate to a few seconds' accuracy in a minute 
or two. 

 


I reply: 

 


Maps showing such a small region constitute a tiny fraction of the data maps 
published in atlases and guidebooks sold to the general public. So your 
success with state maps doesn’t help a whole lot. 

 


You continued: 

 


It just takes two measurements and a short calculation. That's FAR easier 
than trying to correct for the projection's vagaries in assessing distances, 
whether the map is conformal or not. 

 


I reply: 

 


…except that no one needs or uses accurate directly-measured distances 
gotten from a nature guidebook range map or a rainfall distribution map in 
an atlas.

I have resisted adding to this thread up until now because of the rather long 
winded emails that make short, to the point comments difficult.  Against my 
better judgement I will make a short summary of my position on some aspects 
of the thread:

1. In distributing raw data (numeric information) itself I feel using a map as 
the transfer media very questionable.  It would seem to me that the 
information should be made available in some data base format such as an 
arc-node system or at least as point values in a flat file.

The only times I have been involved with digitizing information from maps was 
when the data was originally plotted on the map (as in field operations), 
information was manual drafted on the map (various contourings) and when 
there was absolutely no other way to get hold of the information.

I might add, that digitizing a map can be performed without having any idea of 
the projection by using a callibration grid and correction polynomials.  
This, of course, most easily applies to large scale maps.

2. In displaying global data I feel there is no perfect projection but I must 
add that an equal area projection provides the best mode for visual 
understanding of the what the data represents.

3. In regards to the sinusoidal projection, I think it is one of the poorer 
projections unless it is used in its interupted form.  If it is in interupted 
form, digitizing data from such a map would be a control monster.

I thought it was, however, as I started to write this post, I noticed 
that the title of this list is: "PROJ.4 and general Projections 
Discussions" -- this sure seems to fall into "general Projections 
Discussions", unless software is assumed.

In any case, I'm still a bit confused about the OPs goals. Particularly 
since this is a list talking about software, I tend to think that maps 
tend to be electronic these days. In that case, getting the coords of a 
point is up to the software -- it should be easy to click a point and 
get its coords, or specify coords, and find out if that point is within 
a given feature.

Not that paper maps aren't still of great use, but for analysis, 
electronic maps are far more useful.

Given that, projection should be chosen according to the visual needs of 
the user, which will depend on the expected use, of course.

You wrote:

Your jargon is idiosyncratic

I reply:

I�ve unsuccessfully tried to find, on the Internet, an ica glossary of map 
projection terms. I try to use terms consistently with the usage in various 
books that I�ve seen. Apparently I guessed wrong about �equidistant�. If so, 
then I don�t know what I should call the projection that I�ve been calling 
�equidistant elliptical�. Maybe �equally-spaced elliptical�?

As for �graduated equidistant� projections, I�m the first to admit that I 
don�t know what ica would call it, or whether or not it was named before I 
called it �graduated equidistant�.

You continued:

and your analysis of the issues surrounding your thesis seem to evolve as we 
talk.

I reply:

Not sure how that�s so. From the start, graduated equidistant cylindrical 
was my favorite, and all along I�ve been suggesting sinusoidal as a 
compromise between those wanting easy positions and those wanting 
equal-area. I mentioned a few other compromises too, but the above two are 
the ones I�ve consistently emphasized. Nor have I changed my justifications 
for those suggestions. All along I�ve claimed that one of those two 
projections would be the best for range maps in nature guidebooks and 
spatial distribution maps in atlases.

Later I added that, if a publisher must use azimuthal equal area as a data 
map, it would be nice if they�d at least fully specify the projection (its 
center and orientation). That wasn�t a change in my suggestions, but merely 
an addition.

You continued:

These make it hard for me to engage you in conversation. When a person 
wishes to announce that the world ought to be doing things differently, then 
it behooves the person to exercise due diligence. That includes a rigorous 
analysis and vocabulary of the domain. Without both, conversation gets 
distracted by the parties involved just trying to figure out what the other 
is saying.

I reply:

I admit that guessed wrong the official meaning of �equidistant�. As I said, 
I�ve tried to find an ica glossary of projection terms. If there are other 
incorrect usages of mine that are making me difficult to understand,  they 
aren�t intentional.

You wrote:

Equal-area is a rigorous concept. "Giving accurate and easy 
directly-measured lat/long coordinates" is not, and it is not a "metric 
criterion".

I reply:

Ok then, let me say it more precisely:

The �linearly-interpolable positions� property is possessed by a projection 
if, using a map precisely constructed on that projection, it is possible to 
determine, with accuracy limited only by measuring error, the latitude and 
longitude of a point on the map by using only measurement, with a ruler, of 
distance on the map,  and linear interpolation (and no other calculation)

[end of linearly-interpolable positions property definition]
.
The equidistant cylindrical, the graduated equidistant cylindrical, and the 
sinusoidal all have that property.

Not knowing exactly what is meant by a metric criterion, I�d better not call 
that a metric criterion, but I do call it a precisely-expressible 
measurement property.

You continued:

You have performed no rigorous studies of this property of the sinusoidal

I reply:

Now that I�ve precisely defined the property, it�s obvious that it is 
possessed by the sinusoidal, the equidistant cylindrical, and the graduated 
equidistant cylindrical.

You wrote:

I could easily claim some other projection is better than sinusoidal for 
"accurate and easy directly-measured lat/long coordinates"

I reply:

So could I: The equidistant cylindrical and the graduated equidistant 
cylindrical. The measurement is even easier on those projections because 
they have straight meridians. As I said, I suggest the sinusoidal as a 
compromise to those who want equal area in a data map.

But I welcome any other suggestions for projections with that property. Or, 
if you know of a projection on which latitude and longitude are reasonably 
easy, even if the projection doesn�t have the property I defined above, then 
I�m sure I wouldn�t object to it in nature guidebook range maps and spatial 
distribution maps in atlases.

You continued:

So. How ought I engage your assertion in (2)? This assertion is peripheral 
to your thesis, so, to me, it's whack-a-mole digression.

I reply:

I don�t consider it peripheral or a digression, because I claim that the 
sinusoidal is the best choice for maps whose purpose is to show information 
(such as forest type and land use) for which many people want equal area, 
but for which many others will want accurate linearly-interpolable lat/long 
co-ordinates. And I emphasize that, in everything I�ve been saying, I�m only 
talking about nature guidebook range maps and atlas spatial distribution 
maps. The data maps in those two kinds of books sold to the general public 
in bookstores.

You wrote:

It's not clear to me how often the cartographer shares your priorities.

I reply:

Not very often :^)

You continued:

You may want to think of a map as one that fits your notion of a "data map", 
but people may be using it for many other purposes as well.

I reply:

But isn�t it the natural presumption that the purpose of a forest-type 
spatial distribution map in an atlas is to show where the forest-regions 
are, and maybe the relative areas of those regions?

You wrote:

If the only purpose for the map truly is to easily determine lat/long 
positions, you're best off with a plate carrée, regardless of how distorted 
it gets as you move away from the equator. As soon as you start making 
concessions to other uses, well, suddenly the waters muddy a lot. There 
aren't any easy answers when you compromise because suddenly everyone 
interested in the map wants a different balance of compromises.

I reply:

Quite so. I�d like to say that linearly interpolable position is all that 
matters, but I realize that, for some kinds of mapped data, many people want 
equal area. But the sinusoidal clearly offers both, and so the choice is 
clear.

You wrote:

You started out claiming a "graduated equidistant" is the answer.

I reply:

And I�ve never stopped saying that it�s the answer that I like best. But, 
from my first posting here, I acknowledged that some might want equal area 
for some kinds of mapped data, and that that would make the sinusoidal the 
best choice.

If data maps were made only for me, then sure, I�d specify graduated 
equidistant cylindrical. I  haven�t wavered from that position during these 
postings.

You wrote:

That's already a compromise away from the "easiest" determination of 
lat/long.

I reply:

True. If you�re interpolating latitudes in several latitude zones of a 
graduated equidistant cylindrical, you�d have to measure the north-south 
width of each zone you�re interpolating in, whereas, with the ordinary 
equidistant cylindrical, fewer measurements would be needed. But I felt that 
that compromise is justified to give better shapes on a world map, and near 
conformality on maps of smaller areas.

But I certainly have no objection to the ordinary equidistant cylindrical as 
a data map.

I reply:

You've now evolved to an "interrupted sinusoidal".

I reply:

I didn�t �evolve to� the sinusoidal. I suggested it from the start, in my 
first posting here, as the best choice for data maps if people want equal 
area. And of course I have been acknowledging that many people do want equal 
area for certain kinds of mapped data.

As for �interrupted sinusoidal�, as I said from the start, it greatly 
reduces the sinusoidal�s faults, for a world map.

There was no evolution over time of what I was saying about graduated 
equidistant cylindrical, sinusoidal, and interrupted sinusoidal.

You continued:

Many projections could be argued to provide similar compromises, or a 
"better" balance of those compromises [better for whom?].

I reply:

For guidebook and atlas data maps, in addition to my favorite, the graduated 
equidistant cylindrical, I�ve suggested a few compromises:

1. The sinusoidal, when many people want equal area (which is almost surely 
the case for such things as forest-type and land-use).

2. The graduated equidistant conic, for those who want the low  distortion 
of a locally-centered map, but with reasonably easy lat/long determinations. 
Conic projections don�t possess the linearly interpolable positions 
property, so I don�t like them as much for data maps.

I like the sinusoidal better, because I want linearly interpolable position 
more than I want low distortion, for data maps.

I�d be interested in other compromises that other people might propose.
.
You wrote:

And, most glaringly, how many interruptions are there, and where are they?

I reply:

My favorite interrupted sinusoidal projection is that of the USGS. Shapes on 
it look perfectly good enough.

You continued:

The more interruptions, the greater the accuracy... but the less usable for 
any purpose that spans an interruption.

I reply:

Well, you�d have to pick up a route on the other side of the interruption, 
but it wouldn�t be difficult to find it, due to the sinusoidal�s 
equally-spaced parallels.



You wrote:

What, then, is your thesis?

A) There is a class of maps whose primary function is to allow people to

determination of geographic coordinate, but allowances must be made for

or

D) Something else.

I reply:

I�d say D, though A, B, and C are close. I�d say that A is a true statement, 
if we replace �must� with �should�, but it doesn�t completely say what I 
want to say. So D is my answer.

Here is what I claim:

[The below refers only to species range maps in nature guide-books, and to 
spatial distribution maps in atlases. These are two kinds of books sold to 
the general public in bookstores and found in public libraries. These maps 
are what I mean whenever, below, I say �data maps�. None of this applies to 
maps used only by or intended only for professionals.]

1. All data maps should make it as easy as possible to determine lat/long 
co-ordinates of points on the map. Specifically what I mean by that is that 
data maps should have the linearly-interpolable positions property, except 
where a demand for low distortion justifies using the equidistant conic or 
graduated equidistant conic instead, even though it doesn�t have that 
property.

2. But I claim that the linearly-interpolable positions property and equal 
area are the only properties that can be needed on a data map. So, because 
(with the sinusoidal) it�s possible to have the linearly-interpolable 
positions property, and equal area too, claim that actually all data maps 
should have the linearly-interpolable positions property.

3. For some kinds of mapped data, such  forest-type and land-use, where many 
people want equal-area, the sinusoidal projection is the best choice, 
because it has the linearly-interpolable position property and is an 
equal-area map.

4. For other kinds of mapped data, where equal-area isn�t demanded, the 
cylindrical equidistant or graduated cylindrical equidistant is the best 
choice, because of its maximally easy lat/long determinations.

5. Obviously, when the data map is a world map, and the sinusoidal is used 
(due to desire for equal area) the map should be interrupted, for lower 
distortion. The USGS interrupted sinusoidal is a good projection of that 
type.

[end of data map claims]

If you know anyone who makes decisions about the data maps I�m talking 
about, would you pass these claims on to them?

Or, at least, if they are using the azimuthal equal area map for a data map, 
ask them to at least state (somewhere in the book containing that map) the 
position of the projection�s center (in map co-ordinates and lat/long 
coordinates) and the map�s orientation about that center.

Commenting on theses A, B, and C.

A is true because equal area probably isn�t demanded for all kinds of mapped 
data.

I don�t know about B, because some people might want equal area. And if B 
includes maps used only by professionals, and not just the ones that I�ve 
here called �data maps�, then it is outside the scope of my claims (though 
I�d expect that easy positions, or easy positions and equal area, would be 
the important thing even for professional users of groundcover maps).

As for C, maybe, for some people, equal area is more important than easy 
positions. Certainly allowance must be made for those who want equal area. 
Or, if necessary, even for those who want the low distortion of a 
locally-centered map, though I don�t think that is necessary for any data 
map. All of that is covered in my statement of my claims, above.

Riad,

I'm afraid this is the wrong list for GRASS questions.  I'd suggest you ask
on the grass-user list (see http://grass.itc.it for details on subscribing).

Hello, I use cs2cs utility and try to transform a point (484236, 5006526) using the following command line:
+proj=utm +zone=15 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +to +proj=aeqd +lat_0=-80 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m 

The result is (631024, 6129620).

Then I add flag -I to my command line and try to transform point (631024, 6129620). The result is (329673, -2729005).

Please, could you explain this. Thanks. 

P.S. I suppose that inverse transformation is rigth (631024, 6129620)->(329673, -2729005).

[this belongs on the GRASS mailing list; http://grass.itc.it]

but to answer your question.. the where= option performs a SQL query. You can
use a number of vector modules to describe the attached database, 'v.info -c'
or db.describe might help. Or outside of GRASS you can work the database
directly with whatever Postgres/MySql/DBF/etc software makes you happy.
See the introductory GRASS help pages and wiki for more info.

Subject: [Proj] Reprojection help for a newbie
Message-ID: <46BD3DB4.8090401@ozemail.com.au>

Greetings,

I'm using Grass-GIS, but with a reprojection I was told this list was 
the best place to go.

I have a lot of existing maps using a simple lat-long location in AGD84 
- that is, Australian ellopsoid, zone 0.

I'm now trying to import some maps that were put together using the 
Lambert Conformal Conical projection with the following project info:
Lamberts Conformal Conic, 3, 13, 7, 134, -27, -15, -39, 5000000, 5000000

I can't get the LCC-based map to reproject into the lat-long region and 
display correctly. I've tried cs2cs, but the LCC map is still 
out-of-shape compared to the ADG84 map. So clearly I'm doing something 
wrong. Can anyone tell me the correct use of cs2cs for reprojecting in 
and out of LCC?

Richard

More data if needed:
- For the LCC maps, the pointsfile contains lat-long columns, so I can 
get a file that looks like this:
(x, y, x1, y1)
4984067.30681393 5349948.72155986 133.82 -23.77

- However, for the lat-long files, I only have lat-long data (not the 
corresponding x-y values which would easily locate the lat-long info in 
the LCC space).
- As well as cs2cs, I have tried georectifying the points file towards 
the LCC projection, without success.

Daan--

This is my last posting here. I�m not continuing the argument about maps. 
But I have a right to reply to some of your mis-statements and mis-quotes of 
me. They�ve been the constant theme of your postings, but, for brevity I�m 
mostly commenting on those in your most recent posting. You should 
understand that you are not asked or expected to reply to this.

I�d said:

Accurate directly-measured lat/long positions are a �metric criterion� no 
less than is equal-area.

You said:

Equal-area is a rigorous concept. "Giving accurate and easy 
directly-measured lat/long coordinates" is not

I comment now:

First, the word �easy� was not in �accurate directly-measured lat/long 
positions�, the phrase by which I referred to  a metric criterion.

Definitions should be precise, but I didn�t say that �accurate 
directly-measured lat/long positions� was a definition. It was a brief 
description referring to an obvious, and obviously precisely-definable, 
property of the sinusoidal.

Yes, you could say I was out of line when I referred to a property that I 
hadn�t defined, but, as I said, the property was obvious. But apparently not 
obvious enough, and so I spelled it out for you and walked you through it, 
when I defined the linearly interpolable positions property.

Though I�ve already replied to �Your analysis of the issues surrounding your 
thesis seems to evolve as we talk�, and �You�ve now evolved to an 
interrupted sinusoidal�, I want to mention those false statements again, as 
examples of your overall tendency toward falsity in these postings. You said 
that I�d �evolved to� the sinusoidal, though I�d been suggesting it from my 
first posting here, for when equal-area is desired. My position has been 
consistent in my postings here.

You said:

But more importantly, and back to your thesis, it's not clear to me how 
often the cartographer shares your priorities.

I reply:

Hello? If cartographers shared my priorities, about making data maps 
genuinely usable for their stated purpose, I wouldn�t have had reason to 
post my first message here. Cartographers apparently are conditioned to 
minimize distortion, often to the detriment of a map�s stated purpose.

But, then, cartographers don�t share your priorities either. You said that 
data maps should be equal area, but if you look at some atlases you�ll find 
many data maps that are not equal area. You said that data maps should 
minimize the inaccuracy of directly-measured distances, but if you look at 
some atlases you�ll find many data maps on projections that would definitely 
not be chosen for that purpose. Oh, and did I mention that those two 
requirements of yours are mutually incompatible?

You continued:

You may want to think of a map as one that fits your notion of a "data map"

I reply:

Wrong. It�s not how I �want to think of a map�. The maps to which I referred 
_are_ data maps, by which I said that I mean spatial distribution maps. 
They�re that whether or not someone wants to think of them as such.

You continued:

, but people may be using it for many other purposes as well.

I reply:

By definition, spatial distribution maps tell where certain species ranges, 
temperature zones, etc., are. For those interested, they also show their 
relative areas. But you�re speculating that maybe there may be many other 
unspecified purposes for which people use them. Let me underscore your word 
�may�, and the fact that you�re talking pure unsupported speculation, and 
that you don�t even specify the purposes to which you refer.

Oh yes, you did mention distance. �Hey Joe, our seven and a half minute USGS 
topographic map fell out of my backpack somewhere. Could you toss me that 
bird book, the one with the North America maps showing where the 
bird-species live? We�ll use that to find our way back to the car, and to 
find out how far it is.� It�s good to have a bird book or a rainfall 
distribution map that shows accurate distances! :^)

You said:

What, then, is your thesis?

You added [after describing three theses, A, B, and C, and labeling thesis D 
as �something else�]:

If (D), then I am completely lost, and I must apologize for not following 
your arguments

I reply:

Then you�re completely lost, because it�s D. It�s D, because none of your 
theses A, B, and C accurately quote what I�d been saying. If those represent 
your best effort to quote what I�d been consistently saying, then you indeed 
are completely lost.

You said:

your jargon is idiosyncratic

I reply:

Definition of jargon:

1. Specialized language used when specialized language isn�t needed, and 
used in order to obfuscate a topic or to impress one or more listeners.

2. Specialized language used by someone against whose statements the speaker 
wants to argue.

To a large extent you probably meant that I _wasn�t_ using jargon, but was 
instead using English, the kind in standard dictionaries. Saying that 
someone isn�t using the right jargon serves the same purpose as saying that 
someone isn�t using the correct secret handshake or password. As I said, I 
tried to find an ica glossary of map projection terminology.

We�ve discussed how I mis-guessed the officially correct meaning of 
�equidistant�. Instead of a definition of �equidistant�, I�d only run across 
definitions of three equidistant projections. Their definitions mentioned 
equally-spaced parallels. So my guess was a good one, even if, unknown to 
me, the official types have said that the meridians must be straight.

The projection that I called �equidistant elliptical� has something 
important in common with equidistant cylindrical and equidistant conic: 
Equally spaced parallels. Equally spaced parallels are probably the most 
important and useful property of an equidistant cylindrical that makes it 
different from an equal-area cylindrical. And �equidistant elliptical� has 
that property in common with the officially-named equidistant projections. 
With both projections, the equally spaced parallels greatly facilitate 
determination of latitude. Maybe that means that it would be more useful to 
not limit �equidistant� to uniform scale along straight meridians.

Maybe �equidistant� could be meaningfully and usefully defined in terms of 
equally spaced parallels, and maybe it should be. But I�m only saying that 
my guess was well justified.

If, officially, equidistant maps must have straight meridians, then I have 
to give the name �equally-spaced elliptical� to the projection that I�d 
previously called �equidistant
elliptical�.

Michael,

Your "equidistant elliptical" is Apianus II. Your "graduated equidistant" 
doesn't really have a name; it's just the equirectangular projection with 
standard parallel set to need.

This mention comes completely without any recommendation for the sinusoidal, 
and of course there is no sign at all of interruptions. I've copied your 
original posting below in its entirety, since you seem to have lost it and 
forgotten its content. Hence I'm going to ignore your aspersions of "falsities"; they 
carry no credibility. Of course I am quite done with trying to engage you in 
any conversation.

Hi Richard,

This is the code I use to generate a LCC projection (The Format
statement is part of CString which is an MFC class, but its the same
structure as printf() ):

        CString sProjCmd;
        sProjCmd.Format("+proj=lcc +lat_1=%.16g +lat_2=%.16g
+lat_0=%.16g +lon_0=%.16g +x_0=%.16g +y_0=%.16g ",
			pCS->GetProjection()->GetStdParallel1(),
			pCS->GetProjection()->GetStdParallel2(),
			pCS->GetProjection()->GetOriginLat(),
			dOriginLon,
			dFalseEasting,
			dFalseNorthing);

The parameters for the conformal conic projections supported in the
MAPINFO.PRJ file which comes with MapInfo are:

The parameters for the regional Australian Conformal Conic are:
"Conformal Projection (Australia)", 3, 0, 0, 132.5, -10, -21.5, -33.5,
0, 0

"Australian Lamberts Conformal Conic", 3, 12, 7, 147, 0, -32.666,
-35.333, 1000000, 10000000

"Australian Lamberts Conformal Conic (AGD66)", 3, 12, 7, 135, -24, -18,
-36, 0, 0

The format of these lines is:
"Name", projection_code, datum_code , units_code, origin_lon,
origin_lat, std_parallel_1, std_parallel_2, false_easting,
false_northing

Where:
Projection code 3 = Lambert Conformal Conic
Datum code 12 = AGD66
Units code 7 = Metres

I hope this is some help.

Cheers,
Anthony.

Strebe says:

Your "equidistant elliptical" is Apianus II.

I reply:

Fine. I never claimed priority for it.

Strebe continues:

Your "graduated equidistant"
doesn't really have a name; it's just the equirectangular projection with
standard parallel set to need.

I reply:

Call it what you want. It's useful for what I described.

I didn't refer to my first posting because I was sure that I'd early 
mentioned the sinusoidal as a compromise with those who want equal area.

But at no time did I become an advocate of equal area. I always referred to 
the sinusoidal as a compromise with someone else who wants equal area.

So then, apparently the first time I mentioned the sinusoidal as a 
compromise in these postings was in reply when you said that you considered 
equal area necessary. That was when the possible need for such a compromise 
became obvious to me.  But the fact that I began suggesting the sinusoidal 
as an equal area compromise only after someon expressed need for equal area 
does not mean that I was inconsistent, or that my own preferences "evolved". 
You wanted equal area, and I then suggested a compromise with equal area and 
the linearly interpolable positions property (though I hadn't named or 
precisely defined that property yet).

Strebe continues:

Hence I'm going to ignore your aspersions of "falsities"; they
carry no credibility.

I reply:

I cited a few other falsities. And the claim that my preferences "evolved", 
and that I displayed inconsistecy, when I merely offered an equal area 
compromise when hearing a demand for equal area is itself a falsity. One of 
the several that I mentioned.

[Proj] Concluding comments







Daan--

This is my last posting here. I?m not continuing the argument about maps. 
But I have a right to reply to some of your mis-statements and mis-quotes 
of 
me. They?ve been the constant theme of your postings, but, for brevity I?m 

mostly commenting on those in your most recent posting. You should 
understand that you are not asked or expected to reply to this.

I?d said:

Accurate directly-measured lat/long positions are a ?metric criterion? no 
less than is equal-area.

You said:

Equal-area is a rigorous concept. "Giving accurate and easy 
directly-measured lat/long coordinates" is not

I comment now:

First, the word ?easy? was not in ?accurate directly-measured lat/long 
positions?, the phrase by which I referred to  a metric criterion.

Definitions should be precise, but I didn?t say that ?accurate 
directly-measured lat/long positions? was a definition. It was a brief 
description referring to an obvious, and obviously precisely-definable, 
property of the sinusoidal.

Yes, you could say I was out of line when I referred to a property that I 
hadn?t defined, but, as I said, the property was obvious. But apparently 
not 
obvious enough, and so I spelled it out for you and walked you through it, 

when I defined the linearly interpolable positions property.

Though I?ve already replied to ?Your analysis of the issues surrounding 
your 
thesis seems to evolve as we talk?, and ?You?ve now evolved to an 
interrupted sinusoidal?, I want to mention those false statements again, 
as 
examples of your overall tendency toward falsity in these postings. You 
said 
that I?d ?evolved to? the sinusoidal, though I?d been suggesting it from 
my 
first posting here, for when equal-area is desired. My position has been 
consistent in my postings here.

You said:

But more importantly, and back to your thesis, it's not clear to me how 
often the cartographer shares your priorities.

I reply:

Hello? If cartographers shared my priorities, about making data maps 
genuinely usable for their stated purpose, I wouldn?t have had reason to 
post my first message here. Cartographers apparently are conditioned to 
minimize distortion, often to the detriment of a map?s stated purpose.

But, then, cartographers don?t share your priorities either. You said that 

data maps should be equal area, but if you look at some atlases you?ll 
find 
many data maps that are not equal area. You said that data maps should 
minimize the inaccuracy of directly-measured distances, but if you look at 

some atlases you?ll find many data maps on projections that would 
definitely 
not be chosen for that purpose. Oh, and did I mention that those two 
requirements of yours are mutually incompatible?

You continued:

You may want to think of a map as one that fits your notion of a "data 
map"

I reply:

Wrong. It?s not how I ?want to think of a map?. The maps to which I 
referred 
_are_ data maps, by which I said that I mean spatial distribution maps. 
They?re that whether or not someone wants to think of them as such.

You continued:

, but people may be using it for many other purposes as well.

I reply:

By definition, spatial distribution maps tell where certain species 
ranges, 
temperature zones, etc., are. For those interested, they also show their 
relative areas. But you?re speculating that maybe there may be many other 
unspecified purposes for which people use them. Let me underscore your 
word 
?may?, and the fact that you?re talking pure unsupported speculation, and 
that you don?t even specify the purposes to which you refer.

Oh yes, you did mention distance. ?Hey Joe, our seven and a half minute 
USGS 
topographic map fell out of my backpack somewhere. Could you toss me that 
bird book, the one with the North America maps showing where the 
bird-species live? We?ll use that to find our way back to the car, and to 
find out how far it is.? It?s good to have a bird book or a rainfall 
distribution map that shows accurate distances! :^)

You said:

What, then, is your thesis?

You added [after describing three theses, A, B, and C, and labeling thesis 
D 
as ?something else?]:

If (D), then I am completely lost, and I must apologize for not following 
your arguments

I reply:

Then you?re completely lost, because it?s D. It?s D, because none of your 
theses A, B, and C accurately quote what I?d been saying. If those 
represent 
your best effort to quote what I?d been consistently saying, then you 
indeed 
are completely lost.

You said:

your jargon is idiosyncratic

I reply:

Definition of jargon:

1. Specialized language used when specialized language isn?t needed, and 
used in order to obfuscate a topic or to impress one or more listeners.

2. Specialized language used by someone against whose statements the 
speaker 
wants to argue.

To a large extent you probably meant that I _wasn?t_ using jargon, but was 

instead using English, the kind in standard dictionaries. Saying that 
someone isn?t using the right jargon serves the same purpose as saying 
that 
someone isn?t using the correct secret handshake or password. As I said, I 

tried to find an ica glossary of map projection terminology.

We?ve discussed how I mis-guessed the officially correct meaning of 
?equidistant?. Instead of a definition of ?equidistant?, I?d only run 
across 
definitions of three equidistant projections. Their definitions mentioned 
equally-spaced parallels. So my guess was a good one, even if, unknown to 
me, the official types have said that the meridians must be straight.

The projection that I called ?equidistant elliptical? has something 
important in common with equidistant cylindrical and equidistant conic: 
Equally spaced parallels. Equally spaced parallels are probably the most 
important and useful property of an equidistant cylindrical that makes it 
different from an equal-area cylindrical. And ?equidistant elliptical? has 

that property in common with the officially-named equidistant projections. 

With both projections, the equally spaced parallels greatly facilitate 
determination of latitude. Maybe that means that it would be more useful 
to 
not limit ?equidistant? to uniform scale along straight meridians.

Maybe ?equidistant? could be meaningfully and usefully defined in terms of 

equally spaced parallels, and maybe it should be. But I?m only saying that 

my guess was well justified.

If, officially, equidistant maps must have straight meridians, then I have 

to give the name ?equally-spaced elliptical? to the projection that I?d 
previously called ?equidistant
elliptical?.

Subject: [Proj] Graduated equidistant has a name. Another projection
	suggestion.
Message-ID: <BAY107-F329BB7146BDC73F5A8E90AA5DC0@phx.gbl>




Strebe says:

Your "equidistant elliptical" is Apianus II.

I comment:

Yes, I�d have been very surprised if someone hadn�t previously suggested 
that obvious and simply-constructed projection.

Strebe continues:

Your "graduated equidistant"
doesn't really have a name;

I comment:

Actually it does have a name. It�s called the �graduated equidistant� 
(cylindrical, conic or azimuthal) projection. The one I recommend is the 
graduated equidistant cylindrical because it possesses the linearly 
interpolable positions property (LIPP).

Perhaps what Daan meant to say was that it didn�t have a name before I named 
it.

Strebe continues:

it's just the equirectangular projection with
standard parallel set to need.

I comment:

�and the Lambert-Lagrange projection is just a use of the Mercator and the 
stereographic. Yes, the graduated equidistant projections are more obvious 
and simpler in their construction, but they are distinct projections in 
their own right, though they use equidistant projections. They have a 
specific rule for setting the north-south scale in each latitude-band. For a 
world map, I�ve suggested a 10 degree graticule and latitude band.

And, for instance, the graduated equidistant cylindrical closely resembles 
Mercator, probably to the point of being difficult to distinguish from it 
without measurement. As I said, it can be regarded as the beginning of an 
approximation to the Mercator.

Should the graduated equidistant projections �have a name�? Yes, anything 
useful should have a name. Those projections, like Apianus II, are obvious 
and simply constructed. I�d be surprised if they haven�t been proposed &/or 
used in the past. Their simplicity and usefulness (especially the 
cylindrical) certainly justify their having a name.

Lastly, I concur in commending Daan for his patience in this exchange. For 
his patience
in continuing to try to talk to someone whose positions  were �evolving� so 
inconsistently that he actually suggested an equal-area compromise when Daan 
claimed that equal area is a necessary attribute for a data map. To quote 
Daan, �it doesn�t get any muddier than that.� And try to imagine Daan�s 
exasperation with someone who was so dishonest or negligent that he even 
mistakenly claimed that he suggested the equal-area compromise in his first 
posting, when actually it was in his second posting, immediately after Daan 
advocated the need for equal-area.

Obviously the inconsistent �evolution� described above is enough to render 
communication impossible, and so yes, commendations to you, Daan.

I�d like to suggest another obvious and simply-constructed projection, one 
that has probably been proposed before:

In the manner of the Aitoff and Aitoff-Hammer projections, start with an 
orthographic map of half of the Earth, in equatorial aspect. Expand it 
east-west to twice its width, resulting in a 2:1 elliptical map. Re-label 
its meridians so that they nominally extend over the Earth�s entire 
circumferance. As with similar maps, the central meridian should be the 
Greenwich meridian, or somewhere around the Europe�s west coast, for 
land-mass centeredness.

This results in an orthographic view of a 2:1 oblate ellipsoid on one side 
of which the Earth�s surface has been copied.

Advantages:

Like the other projections I�ve suggested, the map is so simply-constructed 
that its construction can be explained to anyone. I consider that an 
important property that seems little valued by cartographers. In this case, 
of course, the orthographic�s graphical construction is used in that 
demonstration.

For an uninterrupted world map, it shows an especially realistic-looking and 
attractive portrayal of the Earth.

Disadvantage:

Like the ordinary orthographic, t doesn�t do a good job of showing areas 
near its edges.

It probably already has a name, but for now I�d call it �orthographic 
elliptical� or �elliptical orthographic�.

Subject: [Proj] A much better summary of a discussion on this list
Message-ID: <BAY107-F28ED8EDAD1C08C482AF9C7A5DF0@phx.gbl>



Again, I�m sorry to post so much, but I haven�t properly commented on the 
bizarre events of the discussion with Daan.

Before you get angry at me for posting this long message of comments on 
Daan�s statements, I want to remind you that, for each of these comments, 
there was a posted statement by Daan. I�m replying to a huge volume of 
attack based on mis-statements, mis-quotes, straw-man tactics, etc. That�s 
why this posting is so long.

I didn�t start writing to Daan. Daan started writing to me. I didn�t start 
the discussion with Daan. No one asked him to begin characterizing me or the 
quality of my statements.

It�s because Daan chose to characterize me, and because his postings 
�evolved� to be more about me than about my topic,  that I claim that a more 
complete summary of this discussion, with some quotes, is justified. 
Obfuscation or successful misrepresentation is possible when the entire 
record isn�t summarized together, in one posting, as I do here. 
Cross-referencing spoils the effect of Dan�s misquotes, mis-statements, 
evasions and straw-man games. As I said before, I claim that I have a right 
to answer comments or characterizations about me. Because, this time, this 
posting�s comments will be adequately complete, I promise that this will 
_genuinely_ be my last posting here--unless someone else chooses to 
perpetuate the discussion by posting more statements to answer.

And I apologize again to the list for the length of this discussion. I don�t 
want to waste your inbox-space, and this will be my last posting here.

As I�ll show here, with quotations, Daan�s postings in this discussion have, 
from the start, consisted of evasions, mis-statements, misquotes, and rather 
shameless repetition of unsupported claims that he had already been called 
on. And, as is so often resorted to by someone who can�t support his claims 
on their own merit, Daan�s posts tend increasingly toward criticism of the 
person with whom he wants to disagree

Evasions? What�s the point of evasions in voluntary, unsolicited 
opinion-expression? Good question.

I started here merely stating a fault with data maps, and making the 
suggestion that maps intended to tell what is where should give the typical 
user a way to find out what is where. It seemed a simple, harmless, and 
uncontroversial thing to say. More specifically, nearly all map users, when 
they want to find or determine a lat/long position, do so by linear 
interpolation. Therefore there is good reason for a data map, if it is to be 
usable by typical map users, to let positions be accurately found or 
measured by linear interpolation. I had no idea what anger I was stirring up 
by that claim. I had no intention of getting into a contentious discussion.

So, first, let me quote Daan�s first comment about my statements:

Daan said:

Easily converting between map coordinates and spherical coordinates is one 
reason to choose a projection.

I comment:

Especially if the map is for the purpose of showing where something (species 
range, temperature zone, etc) is.

Daan says:

When a mapmaker decides that's the most important reason, the mapmaker does 
just what you suggest.

I comment:

No. He doesn�t. That�s the first of a series of mis-statements by Daan. I�ve 
never heard of a mapmaker using a graduated equidistant projection. I�ve 
never heard of a publisher of a modern-day data map using the equidistant 
elliptical (Apianus II). Even an ordinary equidistant cylindrical is quite 
rare (unheard of these days?) as a data map.

Daan continues:

Generally the mapmaker decides other factors are more important.

I comment:

There, Daan is merely repeating what I�d pointed out. I posted my message 
only because �generally the mapmaker decides that other factors are more 
important�. Daan�s point in repeating me? Who knows? The highest form of 
flattery?

I won�t quote or comment on Daan�s other postings line-by-line, as I did 
with this one. I wanted to show that Daan�s first posting in this discussion 
sets his tone and his discussion-level and conduct throughout. I�ll only 
quote the more brazen mis-statements and the ones that he relies on more.

In his next posting, Daan says:

Mike, I'd need to know a little more about what you mean by "data maps".

I comment:

That�s odd, because, even in my first posting, I clarified that I was 
referring to spatial distribution maps in atlases. Which part of that 
doesn�t Daan understand? Later I include nature guidebook species range 
maps. Is that part of the �evolving� positions that so terribly confuses 
Daan?

Daan says:

Most maps whose primary purpose is to show spatial distributions are 
expected to be equal-area.

I quote this because it�s the reason why I then suggested the sinusoidal as 
a compromise, because it�s both equal-area and linearly interpolable. Daan 
will then say that my addition of the sinusoidal equal-area compromise is an 
�evolution� of positions, and �as muddy as it gets.� I mention that here to 
tell why I quote his mention of equal area.

Daan continues:

Equal-area conflicts with equidistant.

I comment:

Yes, if �equidistant� requires straight meridians. But not if it just refers 
to parallels being equidistantly-spaced on the map. Then the sinusoidal is 
equidistant and equal-area. More importantly, the sinusoidal is both equal 
area and linearly-interpolable. Later Daan wants to make an issue of the 
meaning of �equidistant�, though it isn�t relevant to the value of the 
sinusoidal as a compromise between equal area and linear interpolability.

Next, Daan shows us another ridiculous evasion:

In your example of "zones of vegetation", there are the grossly defined 
"tropical", "temperate", and "arctic" zones, where latitude is the primary 
consideration. In those cases, precise distances mean little and the map's 
depiction of parallels is thought to suffice.

I comment:

I said at the outset that I was referring to spatial distribution maps in 
atlases. I doubt that a map of Daan�s three zones can even be found in a 
modern atlas. And I�ve never found an atlas climate or vegetation map whose 
zones were latitude bands. Perhaps Daan is ignorant of the fact that, at a 
given latitude, deeply continental climate is entirely different from 
coastal climate, and that east coast climate is entirely different from west 
coast climate. And that such things as altitude, rain-shadow effects, nearby 
ocean currents, and monsoon effects cause climate differences between places 
at the same latitude.

But even if atlases had any maps such as Daan describes, it would be a tiny 
fraction of an atlas�s vegetation and climate spatial distribution maps. And 
I was talking about spatial distribution maps in general, not just 
vegetation maps. This is an example of the old and dishonest straw-man 
technique. Why Daan would bother with such techniques and games, I have no 
idea.

Daan continues:

If you are referring to ground-cover maps of a continental or global scope, 
then I should think an equal-area representation would be paramount.

I comment:

But then, when I later, in reply, suggest the sinusoidal as an equal-area 
compromise, Daan calls that a confusing evolution of positions.

Daan continued:

If you are referring to large-scale ground-cover maps

I comment:

Large scale maps in an atlas? As I said, I clarified at the outset that I 
was referring to atlas maps. This could be another straw-man example, or an 
example of Daan�s technique of pretending to mis-understand something or 
miss something, so that he can evade by arguing with something that wasn�t 
said.

Daan continued:

, then the precise purpose of the map would strongly influence the choice of 
projection. In this last case, is the ease of determining the precise 
geographic coordinate of a point more important than accurate distances 
measured between any two points on the map? More important than precise 
directions anywhere on the map? More important than being able to overlay 
and compare against existing printed maps?

I comment:

I�d made it abundantly clear that I was talking about maps whose purpose is 
to show where various kinds of zones are. During the discussion I repeatedly 
pointed out that it would be difficult to find a scenario where someone 
needed accurate distances or directions from a bird book or a rainfall 
distribution map in an atlas. This was apparently always one of the �points� 
that Daan didn�t answer--while he kept on emphasizing the primacy of 
accurate distance.

As for overlays, again, I made it clear that I was talking about atlas and 
bird book maps, which don�t have overlays to lay over USGS maps, etc.

Daan continued:

Your thesis is really about the need for easy conversion from map 
coordinates to geographic coordinates.

I comment:

You catch on fast, Daan.

Daan continues:

I haven't got a good sense yet for why that need trumps the others.

I comment:

Well, how about because Daan has never answered my question about why a user 
of a bird book or atlas rainfall distribution map would need distances or 
directions from that map? �a map that is intended to show where a bird 
species is found, or where a certain rainfall zone is, so that you can 
determine which zone a particular place is in, or whether a particular bird 
can be found in a particular park or county.

In Daan�s next posting, he says:

Constant scale along parallels is not related to equidistance because 
parallels are not great circles. The shortest path between two points on a 
parallel is never the parallel itself unless the parallel is the equator.

I comment:

But I�d never said otherwise. Another example of Daan�s constant, persistent 
straw-man effort.

Without repeating my answers to Daan�s other statements in that posting, 
I�ll merely mention that this is the one where he says:

I can't really get into a whack-a-mole game of responding to each of your 
points only to have several more spring up in their places

I comment:

I had not been sending him a barrage of random whack-a-mole points, only to 
be replaced by new ones. Rather, I�d been merely answering Daan�s own 
statements.

My own �points� were few and consistent: The fact that a map for showing 
where certain zones are is of little use if typical users don�t have an 
accurate way to find and determine positions on the map; the concession 
(after Daan insisted on equal area)  that some might want equal area for 
certain kinds of mapped data, for which the sinusoidal would then be a good 
compromise; and the fact that it would be difficult to come up with a 
scenario in which someone needs accurate distances &/or directions from a 
bird book range-map or a rainfall distribution map in an atlas.

In Daan�s next posting there are just a few brief things to mention. Here he 
makes an unsupported and unspecified charge:
your analysis of the issues surrounding your thesis seem to evolve as we 
talk. These make it hard for me to engage you in conversation.

Later he tells what it is that he claims has �evolved�. I quote this 
because, I quoted him in an earlier posting in which he advocated equal area 
for data maps. Below, he faults me for being inconsistent, or �evolving� 
when I mentioned an equal area compromise, in response to his claim that 
equal area is needed:

Dan says:

You started out claiming a "graduated equidistant" is the answer. You've now 
evolved to an "interrupted sinusoidal". That's about as muddy as it gets.

I comment:

Come again? What�s muddy about offering an equal area compromise when 
someone insists that equal area is needed? I mentioned interruption in 
connection with a world map, where sinusoidal is used because equal area is 
demanded.

In his last posting, I�ll just quote one statement:

Balderdash. You made no mention of the utility of equal-area in your 
original posting

I comment:

Nor did I advocate the utility of equal-area at any time in the discussion. 
I conceded that some might want equal area for some kinds of mapped 
information.. I compromised with the desire for it, by suggesting the 
sinusoidal as an equal-area compromise.

Daan apparently wanted to play the role of the patient (ersatz?) scientist 
doing his best to communicate with someone who wasn�t communicating 
co-operatively. When the facts don�t fit the scenario, that�s no problem for 
Daan, because Daan doesn�t mind mis-representing the facts to fit his 
desired role and his chosen scenario.

A few addenda:

1. Earlier I precisely defined the linearly interpolable positions property 
(LIPP)

I consider LIPP to be a useful way to say what it says.

But a briefer definition and name are possible. I don�t post this in order 
to replace LIPP with it. I merely add it as another way to say it:

A projection has the �linearity� property if, when a map is precisely 
constructed on that projection, it�s possible to divide that map into 
regions, throughout each of which the Y co-ordinate on the map varies 
linearly with latitude, and it�s possible to divide that map into regions, 
throughout each of which the X co-ordinate on the map varies linearly with 
longitude.

[end of linearity property definition]

For practical purposes that definition can be shortened by substituting 
��it�s possible to divide the map into regions throughout each of which the 
Y co-ordinate on the map varies linearly with latitude and the X co-ordinate 
on the map varies linearly with longitude.�

[end of briefer linearity2 property definition]

Officially I�ll stick with the more general longer first wording. Often I 
might use the briefer second wording. Officially, I�ll call the second 
definition the definition of linearity2.

LIPP and linearity are both worthwhile ways of saying it, with different 
emphases in their definition and name.

2. I wouldn�t recommend the orthographic elliptical for an atlas or put it 
on the wall, because it�s more a picture than a useful map. And it has no 
measurement properties.

3. I don�t mean to imply that all maps should have the property that I 
advocate for data maps. What I�ve said about that applies only to species 
range maps in nature guidebooks and spatial distribution maps in atlases.

4. I don�t mean to imply that the only maps that should ever be published 
are those whose construction can be explained to everyone. Some people might 
want the properties of maps that they wouldn�t want to hear the construction 
explanation of, and wouldn�t care about the construction explanation. And 
some might care about the construction but also be familiar with it or 
willing to study it.

But I do claim that construction explainable to everyone is often an 
important and valuable attribute for a map, and one that cartographers don�t 
appreciate. Some people _would_ prefer a map whose construction can easily 
and briefly be defined to them.

Daan continues:

Generally the mapmaker decides other factors are more important.

I comment:

There, Daan is merely repeating what I�d pointed out. I posted my message 
only because �generally the mapmaker decides that other factors are more 
important�. Daan�s point in repeating me? Who knows? The highest form of 
flattery?

I won�t quote or comment on Daan�s other postings line-by-line, as I did 
with this one. I wanted to show that Daan�s first posting in this discussion 
sets his tone and his discussion-level and conduct throughout. I�ll only 
quote the more brazen mis-statements and the ones that he relies on more.

In his next posting, Daan says:

Mike, I'd need to know a little more about what you mean by "data maps".

I comment:

That�s odd, because, even in my first posting, I clarified that I was 
referring to spatial distribution maps in atlases. Which part of that 
doesn�t Daan understand? Later I include nature guidebook species range 
maps. Is that part of the �evolving� positions that so terribly confuses 
Daan?

Daan says:

Most maps whose primary purpose is to show spatial distributions are 
expected to be equal-area.

I quote this because it�s the reason why I then suggested the sinusoidal as 
a compromise, because it�s both equal-area and linearly interpolable. Daan 
will then say that my addition of the sinusoidal equal-area compromise is an 
�evolution� of positions, and �as muddy as it gets.� I mention that here to 
tell why I quote his mention of equal area.

Daan continues:

Equal-area conflicts with equidistant.

I comment:

Yes, if �equidistant� requires straight meridians. But not if it just refers 
to parallels being equidistantly-spaced on the map. Then the sinusoidal is 
equidistant and equal-area. More importantly, the sinusoidal is both equal 
area and linearly-interpolable. Later Daan wants to make an issue of the 
meaning of �equidistant�, though it isn�t relevant to the value of the 
sinusoidal as a compromise between equal area and linear interpolability.

Next, Daan shows us another ridiculous evasion:

In your example of "zones of vegetation", there are the grossly defined 
"tropical", "temperate", and "arctic" zones, where latitude is the primary 
consideration. In those cases, precise distances mean little and the map's 
depiction of parallels is thought to suffice.

I comment:

I said at the outset that I was referring to spatial distribution maps in 
atlases. I doubt that a map of Daan�s three zones can even be found in a 
modern atlas. And I�ve never found an atlas climate or vegetation map whose 
zones were latitude bands. Perhaps Daan is ignorant of the fact that, at a 
given latitude, deeply continental climate is entirely different from 
coastal climate, and that east coast climate is entirely different from west 
coast climate. And that such things as altitude, rain-shadow effects, nearby 
ocean currents, and monsoon effects cause climate differences between places 
at the same latitude.

But even if atlases had any maps such as Daan describes, it would be a tiny 
fraction of an atlas�s vegetation and climate spatial distribution maps. And 
I was talking about spatial distribution maps in general, not just 
vegetation maps. This is an example of the old and dishonest straw-man 
technique. Why Daan would bother with such techniques and games, I have no 
idea.

Daan continues:

If you are referring to ground-cover maps of a continental or global scope, 
then I should think an equal-area representation would be paramount.

I comment:

But then, when I later, in reply, suggest the sinusoidal as an equal-area 
compromise, Daan calls that a confusing evolution of positions.

Daan continued:

If you are referring to large-scale ground-cover maps

I comment:

Large scale maps in an atlas? As I said, I clarified at the outset that I 
was referring to atlas maps. This could be another straw-man example, or an 
example of Daan�s technique of pretending to mis-understand something or 
miss something, so that he can evade by arguing with something that wasn�t 
said.

Daan continued:

, then the precise purpose of the map would strongly influence the choice of 
projection. In this last case, is the ease of determining the precise 
geographic coordinate of a point more important than accurate distances 
measured between any two points on the map? More important than precise 
directions anywhere on the map? More important than being able to overlay 
and compare against existing printed maps?

I comment:

I�d made it abundantly clear that I was talking about maps whose purpose is 
to show where various kinds of zones are. During the discussion I repeatedly 
pointed out that it would be difficult to find a scenario where someone 
needed accurate distances or directions from a bird book or a rainfall 
distribution map in an atlas. This was apparently always one of the �points� 
that Daan didn�t answer--while he kept on emphasizing the primacy of 
accurate distance.

As for overlays, again, I made it clear that I was talking about atlas and 
bird book maps, which don�t have overlays to lay over USGS maps, etc.

Daan continued:

Your thesis is really about the need for easy conversion from map 
coordinates to geographic coordinates.

I comment:

You catch on fast, Daan.

Daan continues:

I haven't got a good sense yet for why that need trumps the others.

I comment:

Well, how about because Daan has never answered my question about why a user 
of a bird book or atlas rainfall distribution map would need distances or 
directions from that map? �a map that is intended to show where a bird 
species is found, or where a certain rainfall zone is, so that you can 
determine which zone a particular place is in, or whether a particular bird 
can be found in a particular park or county.

In Daan�s next posting, he says:

Constant scale along parallels is not related to equidistance because 
parallels are not great circles. The shortest path between two points on a 
parallel is never the parallel itself unless the parallel is the equator.

I comment:

But I�d never said otherwise. Another example of Daan�s constant, persistent 
straw-man effort.

Without repeating my answers to Daan�s other statements in that posting, 
I�ll merely mention that this is the one where he says:

I can't really get into a whack-a-mole game of responding to each of your 
points only to have several more spring up in their places

I comment:

I had not been sending him a barrage of random whack-a-mole points, only to 
be replaced by new ones. Rather, I�d been merely answering Daan�s own 
statements.

My own �points� were few and consistent: The fact that a map for showing 
where certain zones are is of little use if typical users don�t have an 
accurate way to find and determine positions on the map; the concession 
(after Daan insisted on equal area)  that some might want equal area for 
certain kinds of mapped data, for which the sinusoidal would then be a good 
compromise; and the fact that it would be difficult to come up with a 
scenario in which someone needs accurate distances &/or directions from a 
bird book range-map or a rainfall distribution map in an atlas.

In Daan�s next posting there are just a few brief things to mention. Here he 
makes an unsupported and unspecified charge:
your analysis of the issues surrounding your thesis seem to evolve as we 
talk. These make it hard for me to engage you in conversation.

Later he tells what it is that he claims has �evolved�. I quote this 
because, I quoted him in an earlier posting in which he advocated equal area 
for data maps. Below, he faults me for being inconsistent, or �evolving� 
when I mentioned an equal area compromise, in response to his claim that 
equal area is needed:

Dan says:

You started out claiming a "graduated equidistant" is the answer. You've now 
evolved to an "interrupted sinusoidal". That's about as muddy as it gets.

I comment:

Come again? What�s muddy about offering an equal area compromise when 
someone insists that equal area is needed? I mentioned interruption in 
connection with a world map, where sinusoidal is used because equal area is 
demanded.

In his last posting, I�ll just quote one statement:

Balderdash. You made no mention of the utility of equal-area in your 
original posting

I comment:

Nor did I advocate the utility of equal-area at any time in the discussion. 
I conceded that some might want equal area for some kinds of mapped 
information.. I compromised with the desire for it, by suggesting the 
sinusoidal as an equal-area compromise.

Daan apparently wanted to play the role of the patient (ersatz?) scientist 
doing his best to communicate with someone who wasn�t communicating 
co-operatively. When the facts don�t fit the scenario, that�s no problem for 
Daan, because Daan doesn�t mind mis-representing the facts to fit his 
desired role and his chosen scenario.

A few addenda:

1. Earlier I precisely defined the linearly interpolable positions property 
(LIPP)

I consider LIPP to be a useful way to say what it says.

But a briefer definition and name are possible. I don�t post this in order 
to replace LIPP with it. I merely add it as another way to say it:

A projection has the �linearity� property if, when a map is precisely 
constructed on that projection, it�s possible to divide that map into 
regions, throughout each of which the Y co-ordinate on the map varies 
linearly with latitude, and it�s possible to divide that map into regions, 
throughout each of which the X co-ordinate on the map varies linearly with 
longitude.

[end of linearity property definition]

For practical purposes that definition can be shortened by substituting 
��it�s possible to divide the map into regions throughout each of which the 
Y co-ordinate on the map varies linearly with latitude and the X co-ordinate 
on the map varies linearly with longitude.�

[end of briefer linearity2 property definition]

Officially I�ll stick with the more general longer first wording. Often I 
might use the briefer second wording. Officially, I�ll call the second 
definition the definition of linearity2.

LIPP and linearity are both worthwhile ways of saying it, with different 
emphases in their definition and name.

2. I wouldn�t recommend the orthographic elliptical for an atlas or put it 
on the wall, because it�s more a picture than a useful map. And it has no 
measurement properties.

3. I don�t mean to imply that all maps should have the property that I 
advocate for data maps. What I�ve said about that applies only to species 
range maps in nature guidebooks and spatial distribution maps in atlases.

4. I don�t mean to imply that the only maps that should ever be published 
are those whose construction can be explained to everyone. Some people might 
want the properties of maps that they wouldn�t want to hear the construction 
explanation of, and wouldn�t care about the construction explanation. And 
some might care about the construction but also be familiar with it or 
willing to study it.

But I do claim that construction explainable to everyone is often an 
important and valuable attribute for a map, and one that cartographers don�t 
appreciate. Some people _would_ prefer a map whose construction can easily 
and briefly be defined to them.

Again, Im sorry to post so much, but I havent properly commented on the 
bizarre events of the discussion with Daan.

Before you get angry at me for posting this long message of comments on 
Daans statements, I want to remind you that, for each of these comments, 
there was a posted statement by Daan. Im replying to a huge volume of 
attack based on mis-statements, mis-quotes, straw-man tactics, etc. Thats 
why this posting is so long.

I didnt start writing to Daan. Daan started writing to me. I didnt start 
the discussion with Daan. No one asked him to begin characterizing me or the 
quality of my statements.

Its because Daan chose to characterize me, and because his postings 
evolved to be more about me than about my topic,  that I claim that a more 
complete summary of this discussion, with some quotes, is justified. 
Obfuscation or successful misrepresentation is possible when the entire 
record isnt summarized together, in one posting, as I do here. 
Cross-referencing spoils the effect of Dans misquotes, mis-statements, 
evasions and straw-man games. As I said before, I claim that I have a right 
to answer comments or characterizations about me. Because, this time, this 
postings comments will be adequately complete, I promise that this will 
_genuinely_ be my last posting here--unless someone else chooses to 
perpetuate the discussion by posting more statements to answer.

And I apologize again to the list for the length of this discussion. I dont 
want to waste your inbox-space, and this will be my last posting here.

As Ill show here, with quotations, Daans postings in this discussion have, 
from the start, consisted of evasions, mis-statements, misquotes, and rather 
shameless repetition of unsupported claims that he had already been called 
on. And, as is so often resorted to by someone who cant support his claims 
on their own merit, Daans posts tend increasingly toward criticism of the 
person with whom he wants to disagree

Evasions? Whats the point of evasions in voluntary, unsolicited 
opinion-expression? Good question.

I started here merely stating a fault with data maps, and making the 
suggestion that maps intended to tell what is where should give the typical 
user a way to find out what is where. It seemed a simple, harmless, and 
uncontroversial thing to say. More specifically, nearly all map users, when 
they want to find or determine a lat/long position, do so by linear 
interpolation. Therefore there is good reason for a data map, if it is to be 
usable by typical map users, to let positions be accurately found or 
measured by linear interpolation. I had no idea what anger I was stirring up 
by that claim. I had no intention of getting into a contentious discussion.

So, first, let me quote Daans first comment about my statements:

Daan said:

Easily converting between map coordinates and spherical coordinates is one 
reason to choose a projection.

I comment:

Especially if the map is for the purpose of showing where something (species 
range, temperature zone, etc) is.

Daan says:

When a mapmaker decides that's the most important reason, the mapmaker does 
just what you suggest.

I comment:

No. He doesnt. Thats the first of a series of mis-statements by Daan. Ive 
never heard of a mapmaker using a graduated equidistant projection. Ive 
never heard of a publisher of a modern-day data map using the equidistant 
elliptical (Apianus II). Even an ordinary equidistant cylindrical is quite 
rare (unheard of these days?) as a data map.

Daan continues:

Generally the mapmaker decides other factors are more important.

I comment:

There, Daan is merely repeating what Id pointed out. I posted my message 
only because generally the mapmaker decides that other factors are more 
important. Daans point in repeating me? Who knows? The highest form of 
flattery?

I wont quote or comment on Daans other postings line-by-line, as I did 
with this one. I wanted to show that Daans first posting in this discussion 
sets his tone and his discussion-level and conduct throughout. Ill only 
quote the more brazen mis-statements and the ones that he relies on more.

In his next posting, Daan says:

Mike, I'd need to know a little more about what you mean by "data maps".

I comment:

I comment:

There, Daan is merely repeating what Id pointed out. I posted my message 
only because generally the mapmaker decides that other factors are more 
important. Daans point in repeating me? Who knows? The highest form of 
flattery?

I wont quote or comment on Daans other postings line-by-line, as I did 
with this one. I wanted to show that Daans first posting in this discussion 
sets his tone and his discussion-level and conduct throughout. Ill only 
quote the more brazen mis-statements and the ones that he relies on more.

In his next posting, Daan says:

Mike, I'd need to know a little more about what you mean by "data maps".

I comment:

Thats odd, because, even in my first posting, I clarified that I was 
referring to spatial distribution maps in atlases. Which part of that 
doesnt Daan understand? Later I include nature guidebook species range 
maps. Is that part of the evolving positions that so terribly confuses 
Daan?

Daan says:

Most maps whose primary purpose is to show spatial distributions are 
expected to be equal-area.

I quote this because its the reason why I then suggested the sinusoidal as 
a compromise, because its both equal-area and linearly interpolable. Daan 
will then say that my addition of the sinusoidal equal-area compromise is an 
evolution of positions, and as muddy as it gets. I mention that here to 
tell why I quote his mention of equal area.

Daan continues:

Equal-area conflicts with equidistant.

I comment:

Yes, if equidistant requires straight meridians. But not if it just refers 
to parallels being equidistantly-spaced on the map. Then the sinusoidal is 
equidistant and equal-area. More importantly, the sinusoidal is both equal 
area and linearly-interpolable. Later Daan wants to make an issue of the 
meaning of equidistant, though it isnt relevant to the value of the 
sinusoidal as a compromise between equal area and linear interpolability.

Next, Daan shows us another ridiculous evasion:

In your example of "zones of vegetation", there are the grossly defined 
"tropical", "temperate", and "arctic" zones, where latitude is the primary 
consideration. In those cases, precise distances mean little and the map's 
depiction of parallels is thought to suffice.

I comment:

I said at the outset that I was referring to spatial distribution maps in 
atlases. I doubt that a map of Daans three zones can even be found in a 
modern atlas. And Ive never found an atlas climate or vegetation map whose 
zones were latitude bands. Perhaps Daan is ignorant of the fact that, at a 
given latitude, deeply continental climate is entirely different from 
coastal climate, and that east coast climate is entirely different from west 
coast climate. And that such things as altitude, rain-shadow effects, nearby 
ocean currents, and monsoon effects cause climate differences between places 
at the same latitude.

But even if atlases had any maps such as Daan describes, it would be a tiny 
fraction of an atlass vegetation and climate spatial distribution maps. And 
I was talking about spatial distribution maps in general, not just 
vegetation maps. This is an example of the old and dishonest straw-man 
technique. Why Daan would bother with such techniques and games, I have no 
idea.

Daan continues:

If you are referring to ground-cover maps of a continental or global scope, 
then I should think an equal-area representation would be paramount.

I comment:

But then, when I later, in reply, suggest the sinusoidal as an equal-area 
compromise, Daan calls that a confusing evolution of positions.

Daan continued:

If you are referring to large-scale ground-cover maps

I comment:

Large scale maps in an atlas? As I said, I clarified at the outset that I 
was referring to atlas maps. This could be another straw-man example, or an 
example of Daans technique of pretending to mis-understand something or 
miss something, so that he can evade by arguing with something that wasnt 
said.

Daan continued:

, then the precise purpose of the map would strongly influence the choice of 
projection. In this last case, is the ease of determining the precise 
geographic coordinate of a point more important than accurate distances 
measured between any two points on the map? More important than precise 
directions anywhere on the map? More important than being able to overlay 
and compare against existing printed maps?

I comment:

Id made it abundantly clear that I was talking about maps whose purpose is 
to show where various kinds of zones are. During the discussion I repeatedly 
pointed out that it would be difficult to find a scenario where someone 
needed accurate distances or directions from a bird book or a rainfall 
distribution map in an atlas. This was apparently always one of the points 
that Daan didnt answer--while he kept on emphasizing the primacy of 
accurate distance.

As for overlays, again, I made it clear that I was talking about atlas and 
bird book maps, which dont have overlays to lay over USGS maps, etc.

Daan continued:

Your thesis is really about the need for easy conversion from map 
coordinates to geographic coordinates.

I comment:

You catch on fast, Daan.

Daan continues:

I haven't got a good sense yet for why that need trumps the others.

I comment:

Well, how about because Daan has never answered my question about why a user 
of a bird book or atlas rainfall distribution map would need distances or 
directions from that map? 
a map that is intended to show where a bird 
species is found, or where a certain rainfall zone is, so that you can 
determine which zone a particular place is in, or whether a particular bird 
can be found in a particular park or county.

In Daans next posting, he says:

Constant scale along parallels is not related to equidistance because 
parallels are not great circles. The shortest path between two points on a 
parallel is never the parallel itself unless the parallel is the equator.

I comment:

But Id never said otherwise. Another example of Daans constant, persistent 
straw-man effort.

Without repeating my answers to Daans other statements in that posting, 
Ill merely mention that this is the one where he says:

I can't really get into a whack-a-mole game of responding to each of your 
points only to have several more spring up in their places

I comment:

I had not been sending him a barrage of random whack-a-mole points, only to 
be replaced by new ones. Rather, Id been merely answering Daans own 
statements.

My own points were few and consistent: The fact that a map for showing 
where certain zones are is of little use if typical users dont have an 
accurate way to find and determine positions on the map; the concession 
(after Daan insisted on equal area)  that some might want equal area for 
certain kinds of mapped data, for which the sinusoidal would then be a good 
compromise; and the fact that it would be difficult to come up with a 
scenario in which someone needs accurate distances &/or directions from a 
bird book range-map or a rainfall distribution map in an atlas.

In Daans next posting there are just a few brief things to mention. Here he 
makes an unsupported and unspecified charge:
your analysis of the issues surrounding your thesis seem to evolve as we 
talk. These make it hard for me to engage you in conversation.

Later he tells what it is that he claims has evolved. I quote this 
because, I quoted him in an earlier posting in which he advocated equal area 
for data maps. Below, he faults me for being inconsistent, or evolving 
when I mentioned an equal area compromise, in response to his claim that 
equal area is needed:

Dan says:

You started out claiming a "graduated equidistant" is the answer. You've now 
evolved to an "interrupted sinusoidal". That's about as muddy as it gets.

I comment:

Come again? Whats muddy about offering an equal area compromise when 
someone insists that equal area is needed? I mentioned interruption in 
connection with a world map, where sinusoidal is used because equal area is 
demanded.

In his last posting, Ill just quote one statement:

Balderdash. You made no mention of the utility of equal-area in your 
original posting

I comment:

Nor did I advocate the utility of equal-area at any time in the discussion. 
I conceded that some might want equal area for some kinds of mapped 
information.. I compromised with the desire for it, by suggesting the 
sinusoidal as an equal-area compromise.

Daan apparently wanted to play the role of the patient (ersatz?) scientist 
doing his best to communicate with someone who wasnt communicating 
co-operatively. When the facts dont fit the scenario, thats no problem for 
Daan, because Daan doesnt mind mis-representing the facts to fit his 
desired role and his chosen scenario.

A few addenda:

1. Earlier I precisely defined the linearly interpolable positions property 
(LIPP)

I consider LIPP to be a useful way to say what it says.

But a briefer definition and name are possible. I dont post this in order 
to replace LIPP with it. I merely add it as another way to say it:

A projection has the linearity property if, when a map is precisely 
constructed on that projection, its possible to divide that map into 
regions, throughout each of which the Y co-ordinate on the map varies 
linearly with latitude, and its possible to divide that map into regions, 
throughout each of which the X co-ordinate on the map varies linearly with 
longitude.

[end of linearity property definition]

For practical purposes that definition can be shortened by substituting 

its possible to divide the map into regions throughout each of which the 
Y co-ordinate on the map varies linearly with latitude and the X co-ordinate 
on the map varies linearly with longitude.

[end of briefer linearity2 property definition]

Officially Ill stick with the more general longer first wording. Often I 
might use the briefer second wording. Officially, Ill call the second 
definition the definition of linearity2.

LIPP and linearity are both worthwhile ways of saying it, with different 
emphases in their definition and name.

2. I wouldnt recommend the orthographic elliptical for an atlas or put it 
on the wall, because its more a picture than a useful map. And it has no 
measurement properties.

3. I dont mean to imply that all maps should have the property that I 
advocate for data maps. What Ive said about that applies only to species 
range maps in nature guidebooks and spatial distribution maps in atlases.

4. I dont mean to imply that the only maps that should ever be published 
are those whose construction can be explained to everyone. Some people might 
want the properties of maps that they wouldnt want to hear the construction 
explanation of, and wouldnt care about the construction explanation. And 
some might care about the construction but also be familiar with it or 
willing to study it.

But I do claim that construction explainable to everyone is often an 
important and valuable attribute for a map, and one that cartographers dont 
appreciate. Some people _would_ prefer a map whose construction can easily 
and briefly be defined to them.

Michael,

I suggest that if you have a new projection to contribute to the 
community, publish it is a peer-reviewed journal. If it is really great 
and new & improved, people will flock to is and use it routinely.

If is not a new projection, and you are creating a new map, choose the 
projection that you want. As daan said, a cartographer chooses a 
projection to meet a certain need (or a priority of needs). I doubt that 
you are going to change the world of cartography by posting on one 
listServ.

Thanks for your suggestions, Mike Finn!

You said:

I suggest that if you have a new projection�

I comment:

The only possibly new ones that I�d recommend are the graduated equidistant 
projections. So far there�s no information that they aren�t new, but they 
probably are _not_ new. The graduated equidistant cylindrical is the only 
possibly new projection that I recommend for the purpose that we�ve been 
discussing.

You continued:

I reply:

Consider it contributed, by being posted here. If you think that it is 
�really great and new & improved�, then feel free to flock to it, Mike.

I may suggest it elsewhere, or may not, subject to available time.

A mailing list is an easy way to say something to a good number of people. 
For all I know, there may even be someone on his list who is at least 
indirectly associated with someone who makes decisions about putting 
together an atlas or nature guidebook. Or maybe not.

You continued:

publish it is a peer-reviewed journal.

I reply:

You know what, I�m going to pass on that one.

I doubt that communicating with academic cartographers would be a productive 
use of my time.

For one thing, I don�t know how much of a role, if any, academic 
cartographers have in the choice of projections for atlases and nature 
guidebooks.

For another thing, you flatter me, Mike--there�s no reason to believe that 
an academic cartographer is going to start taking an interest in what is 
useful to the map-using public just because of persuasion by me. 
Fortunately, it probably doesn�t matter, if that isn�t who makes the atlas 
and nature guidebook decisions.

You continued:

If it is really great

I reply:

Again you flatter me. Good, certainly useful, but great?? Let�s not try to 
set me alongside Alexander.

You continued:

I reply:

It may well be new, the class of projections that I call the graduated 
equidistant projections. Probably not.

You continued:

I reply:

Without a doubt, for the special purpose of  spatial distribution maps in 
atlases and nature guidebooks.

You continued:

I reply:

Flock away, Mike!

You continued:

If is not a new projection

I reply:

�which may very well be the case.

You continued:


and you are creating a new map

I reply:

Now you�re being silly. Did I say that I was creating a new map, or did I 
merely suggest that data maps (as I�ve narrowly defined them) are being 
published on projections that don�t make them very usable.

You continued:

, choose the projection that you want.

I reply:

You�re too generous.

You continued:

As daan said, a cartographer chooses a projection to meet a certain need (or 
a priority of needs).

I reply:

Don�t be offended, because I don�t mean any offense by this, but your 
statement quoted above is an inane, head-up-the-ass, truism.

Aside from that, maybe sometimes cartographers choose �to meet a certain 
need or priority of needs� that is incompatible with the map�s actual 
purpose and use. As I said, maybe cartographers are conditioned to minimize 
distortion, sometimes to the detriment of the map�s usefulness for its 
purpose.

But I don�t know that cartographers make the editorial decisions on what 
projections to use in nature guidebooks and atlas spatial distribution maps.

You continued:

I doubt that you are going to change the world of cartography

I reply:

Mike, you flatter me again! I didn�t set out to change the world of 
cartography--but merely to mention to this list a questionable 
projection-choice.

Is there any way to cut it off?

If Gerald wants to say that what I said was incorrect, he forgot to tell us 
why he thinks so.

Gerald continues:

I comment:

All we're hearing from Gerald are angry noises and namecalling.

Certainly, if it degenerates to zero-content postings like this one by 
Gerald, consisting only of expressions of anger, unsupported

�and then  replied:

I can only comment: After 3 weeks of discussion I still haven't seen any 
solution.

I comment:

The solution (to the need for more usable data maps) that I was referring to 
there, the one that I haven�t seen mentioned anywhere, is the graduated 
equidistant cylindrical, which has the linearly interpolable positions 
property.

Other obvious solutions, also sharing the linearly interpolable positions 
property, are the ordinary equidistant cylindrical, and the sinusoidal. I�ve 
  mentioned all three of those solutions  on this list. I mentioned the 
first two in my first posting.
.
Though the equidistant conic and graduated equidistant conic don�t have the 
LIPP, they allow for easier lat/long determination than the projections 
usually used for data maps. I mentioned those in my postings too, including 
my first posting.

I emphasize that all of those were mentioned in my first posting (except for 
the sinusoidal, which I suggested after Daan advocated the need for 
equal-area for data maps.

Oscar continues:

Where are the equations or code for forward and inverse?

I comment:

I want to assure Oscar that the cylindrical equidistant, the graduated 
equidistant cylindrical, and the sinusoidal are not mathematically difficult 
to construct. He can find equations for the their construction and inverse 
construction of the equidistant cylindrical and the sinusoidal in books that 
cover such things.

The graduated equidistant cylindrical won�t be difficult either, since it 
merely consists of the equidistant cylindrical, with different north-south 
scale in different latitude bands.

I encourage Oscar to let me know if he has trouble constructing the 
equidistant cylindrical, the graduated equidistant cylindrical, and the 
sinusoidal.

I want to emphasize that very easy determination of X and Y map co-ordinates 
from lat/long co-ordinates, and very easy determination of lat/long 
co-ordinates from map X and Y co-ordinates are the whole point of the 
projections that I�ve been suggesting for data maps.

Maybe Oscar is asking specifically about the graduated equidistant 
cylindrical, since the ordinary equidistant cylindrical and the sinusoidal 
are already well-described, an their equations of construction and inverse 
construction are surely easy for anyone to find.

Let me repeat my clear definition of the graduated equidistant cylindrical 
projection:

It is the equidistant cylindrical, but with different north-south scale in 
different latitude bands. Each two consecutive parallels shown on the map 
bound such a latitude band. In that latitude band, the north-south scale is 
the geometric mean of the east-west scales along the two depicted parallels 
that bound that latitude band.

Obviously something different must be done, on a world map, for the 
northernmost and southernmost latitude bands, because obviously, like 
Mercator, this projection can�t show the poles.. As one way of dealing with 
this, I suggest letting latitude 85 be the extreme poleward limit of a world 
map on this projection,  and the poleward bounding latitude of the most 
poleward latitude bands. So the most extreme latitude bands would be from 
latitude 80 to latitude 85. Obviously other ways of dealing with polar 
regions could be suggested too.

Of course it won�t always be desired to show the Earth all the way from 85 
south to 85 north.

[end of definition of the graduated equidistant cylindrical projection]

Oscar, let me know if you have trouble writing equations for the 
construction and inverse construction of that projection, and I�ll help you 
out.


Oscar continues:

If no one can come up with a practical solution, then for that reason the 
discussion thread in this list should probably end.

I comment:

1. I have proposed practical solutions to the problem of finding projections 
for more usable data maps.

2. Yes, the thread should probably end, since everything to be said on the 
subject has been said--unless someone has a constructive suggestion.

- Hi Everyone,

In regard to recent discussions on cylindrical map projections, I thought I 
would toss a 'tangent' thought into the mix.

Years ago, due to being confused myself, I researched the available 
literature for cylindrical map projection formulas. I eventually gave the 
notes I made to Gerald Evenden and he greatly expanded on them. Chapter 4 of 
his Libproj4 Manual (Mar 2005), in my 'obviously biased' opinion, is the 
best reference one can find on cylindrical map projections. Enough said on 
that subject!

BTW, daan Strebe I just recently came across your Oct 06 CaGIS Map 
Projection article. Thanks for mentioning me!

I've recently recovered enough from medical problems to be able to resume, 
as a student, a 'GIS Certificate' course at ODU so that I could learn 
'ArcGIS 9.2'. My new Instructor, for some reason, was not amused to learn 
that the textbook she chose for the class (ISBN: 0-13-129317-6) features 
some of my graphics on page 44. Regretfully, there are at least 4 author 
introduced errors on that page alone.

Some graphics:
On the MapHist list-serv in 2005 someone made a comment about a map based on 
the phrase 'The World is my Oyster'. I replied with the following comments. 
Note that my claim here is that the graphics below are merely visually 
interesting, however, for most of them the forward formulas are available.

This one was where I was experimenting with summing the X and Y coordinates 
of different graticule groups just to see what developed:
http://www.galleryofmapprojections.com/images/seashell.pdf

Everyone that experiments with map projection formulas comes up with 
unexpected, but visually interesting mistakes. Here are some more of my 
'amusements':

This one was where I was experimenting with the Nell Modified Conic -- until 
I realized that Snyder's description (in Flattening) was incomplete. The 
pattern produced in what I had already done just popped out at me, so, I 
cleaned the graphic up (lots of grunt work) in Corel Draw and saved it:
http://www.galleryofmapprojections.com/images/Mickey.pdf

Dr. Don Zeigler (Geog Dept, ODU) named this one the Bay Window projection. 
It was one of my earliest goofs. Even though I saved the formulas, I don't 
remember how I arrived at this one:
http://www.galleryofmapprojections.com/images/baywindow.gif

This one came about because I accidentally put the divide symbol in the 
place of the subtract symbol in the X coordinate portion of Moir's formulas. 
At that time I had not seen an actual graphic of the projection and John 
Snyder was the one who caught my error. He suggested I save the formulas and 
name it the 'Bad Times' projection:
http://www.galleryofmapprojections.com/images/badtimes.gif

This Polycylindrical projection came about from experimenting with various Y 
coordinate formulas in place of the ones Dr. Tobler used in his paper on 
Polycylindricals. I kept it because it was 'visually' interesting.
http://www.galleryofmapprojections.com/images/polycyl.gif

I did not give this one a name. It is amazing in that with one set of 
formulas the outer portion of the graticule forms a rectangle while the 
parallels within are curved:

A link to Gerald Evenden's Libproj4 Manual that I mentioned above can be

Message-ID: <BAY107-F257FAE2BA5BFD6C5E34B8AA5DB0@phx.gbl>


This may not be worded in the most customary way.

The origin of map co-ordinates is the intersection of the equator with the 
west edge of the map.

"Lon" means longitude in degrees east from the west edge of the map.

"Lat" means latitude, positive or negative,  in degrees.

X is a function only of Lon.

Y is a function only of Lat.

X(Long) = R*Lon*(pi/180).

Each latitude band is bounded by two consecutive parallels of the uniform 
graticule.

Y(0) = 0

Within any latitude band bounded by Lat1 and Lat2, where |Lat2| > |Lat1|,

Y(Lat) = Y(Lat1) + R*(Lat - Lat1)*(pi/180)*sqr(sec(Lat1)*sec(Lat2)).


Projections, including graduated equidistant cylindrical, can be defined 
completely by a verbal description in ordinary English, but I was asked for 
equations for the graduated equidistant cylindrical.

The solution (to the need for more usable data maps) that I was referring
to there, the one that I havent seen mentioned anywhere, is the graduated
equidistant cylindrical, which has the linearly interpolable positions
property.

Other obvious solutions, also sharing the linearly interpolable positions
property, are the ordinary equidistant cylindrical, and the
sinusoidal. Ive mentioned all three of those solutions  on this list. I
mentioned the first two in my first posting.
.
Though the equidistant conic and graduated equidistant conic dont have the
LIPP, they allow for easier lat/long determination than the projections
usually used for data maps. I mentioned those in my postings too, including
my first posting.

I emphasize that all of those were mentioned in my first posting (except
for the sinusoidal, which I suggested after Daan advocated the need for
equal-area for data maps.

> Where are the equations or code for forward and inverse?

I want to assure Oscar that the cylindrical equidistant, the graduated
equidistant cylindrical, and the sinusoidal are not mathematically
difficult to construct. He can find equations for the their construction
and inverse construction of the equidistant cylindrical and the sinusoidal
in books that cover such things.

The graduated equidistant cylindrical wont be difficult either, since it
merely consists of the equidistant cylindrical, with different north-south
scale in different latitude bands.

I encourage Oscar to let me know if he has trouble constructing the
equidistant cylindrical, the graduated equidistant cylindrical, and the
sinusoidal.

I want to emphasize that very easy determination of X and Y map
co-ordinates from lat/long co-ordinates, and very easy determination of
lat/long co-ordinates from map X and Y co-ordinates are the whole point of
the projections that Ive been suggesting for data maps.

Maybe Oscar is asking specifically about the graduated equidistant
cylindrical, since the ordinary equidistant cylindrical and the sinusoidal
are already well-described, an their equations of construction and inverse
construction are surely easy for anyone to find.

Let me repeat my clear definition of the graduated equidistant cylindrical
projection:

It is the equidistant cylindrical, but with different north-south scale in
different latitude bands. Each two consecutive parallels shown on the map
bound such a latitude band. In that latitude band, the north-south scale is
the geometric mean of the east-west scales along the two depicted parallels
that bound that latitude band.

Obviously something different must be done, on a world map, for the
northernmost and southernmost latitude bands, because obviously, like
Mercator, this projection cant show the poles.. As one way of dealing
with this, I suggest letting latitude 85 be the extreme poleward limit of a
world map on this projection,  and the poleward bounding latitude of the
most poleward latitude bands. So the most extreme latitude bands would be
from latitude 80 to latitude 85. Obviously other ways of dealing with polar
regions could be suggested too.

Of course it wont always be desired to show the Earth all the way from 85
south to 85 north.

[end of definition of the graduated equidistant cylindrical projection]

Oscar, let me know if you have trouble writing equations for the
construction and inverse construction of that projection, and Ill help you
out.

> If noone can come up with a practical solution, then for that reason the
> discussion thread in this list should probably end.

1. I have proposed practical solutions to the problem of finding
projections for more usable data maps.

2. Yes, the thread should probably end, since everything to be said on the
subject has been said--unless someone has a constructive suggestion.

LIPP, they allow for easier lat/long determination than the projections
usually used for data maps. I mentioned those in my postings too, including
my first posting.

I emphasize that all of those were mentioned in my first posting (except
for the sinusoidal, which I suggested after Daan advocated the need for
equal-area for data maps.

> Where are the equations or code for forward and inverse?

I want to assure Oscar that the cylindrical equidistant, the graduated
equidistant cylindrical, and the sinusoidal are not mathematically
difficult to construct. He can find equations for the their construction
and inverse construction of the equidistant cylindrical and the sinusoidal
in books that cover such things.

The graduated equidistant cylindrical wont be difficult either, since it
merely consists of the equidistant cylindrical, with different north-south
scale in different latitude bands.

I encourage Oscar to let me know if he has trouble constructing the
equidistant cylindrical, the graduated equidistant cylindrical, and the
sinusoidal.

I want to emphasize that very easy determination of X and Y map
co-ordinates from lat/long co-ordinates, and very easy determination of
lat/long co-ordinates from map X and Y co-ordinates are the whole point of
the projections that Ive been suggesting for data maps.

Maybe Oscar is asking specifically about the graduated equidistant
cylindrical, since the ordinary equidistant cylindrical and the sinusoidal
are already well-described, an their equations of construction and inverse
construction are surely easy for anyone to find.

Let me repeat my clear definition of the graduated equidistant cylindrical
projection:

It is the equidistant cylindrical, but with different north-south scale in
different latitude bands. Each two consecutive parallels shown on the map
bound such a latitude band. In that latitude band, the north-south scale is
the geometric mean of the east-west scales along the two depicted parallels
that bound that latitude band.

Obviously something different must be done, on a world map, for the
northernmost and southernmost latitude bands, because obviously, like
Mercator, this projection cant show the poles.. As one way of dealing
with this, I suggest letting latitude 85 be the extreme poleward limit of a
world map on this projection,  and the poleward bounding latitude of the
most poleward latitude bands. So the most extreme latitude bands would be
from latitude 80 to latitude 85. Obviously other ways of dealing with polar
regions could be suggested too.

Of course it wont always be desired to show the Earth all the way from 85
south to 85 north.

[end of definition of the graduated equidistant cylindrical projection]

Oscar, let me know if you have trouble writing equations for the
construction and inverse construction of that projection, and Ill help you
out.

1. I have proposed practical solutions to the problem of finding
projections for more usable data maps.

2. Yes, the thread should probably end, since everything to be said on the
subject has been said--unless someone has a constructive suggestion.

	Equations for Apianus II, sinusoidal, cylindrical equidistant
Message-ID: <BAY107-F30AB6DEB2C4E6FFD6A4F44A5D40@phx.gbl>


Because Oscar asked �Where are the equations�, and so that that other person 
won�t think that I�m being like Fermat, I�m posting the equations for all 
four of the projections that I�ve recommended that have the linearly 
interpolable positions property.

I�ve already posted the equations for the graduated equidistant cylindrical, 
and in this posting are the equations for Apianus II (equally-spaced 
elliptical), the sinusoidal, and the ordinary equidistant cylindrical.

The other day, for the graduated equidistant cylindrical, I had the map 
co-ordinates� origin, and 0 longitude, at the west edge of the projection, 
but for the remaining three, today, I�m saying it differently, in a way 
that�s more generally useful, so that I only have to say that part once, for 
all three projections.

The origin of the map co-ordinates is at the intersection of the equator and 
the central meridian.

�Lat� means latitude in degrees, positive if north, and negative if south.

�Lon� means longitude in degrees, with respect to the central meridian, 
positive if east of the central meridian, negative if west of the central 
meridian.

That applies for all of the following three projections.

Apianus II:

Y = R*Lat*(pi/180)

A = pi*R

X = sqr(A*A-4*Y*Y)*(lon/180)

Sinusoidal:

Y = R*Lat*(pi/180)

X = R*Lon*(pi/180)*cos(Lat)

Ordinary equidistant cylindrical:

Y = R*Lat*(pi/180)

X = R*Lon*(pi/180)

Sue,

The page lists the projection method parameters for transverse mercator,
but there are many other standard options like ellipse, datum, and
linear units which can also come into play.

If properly installed the ellipse/datum should default to WGS84, but this
depends on finding a defaults file at runtime.  If this isn't found you
would need to provide the information.
eg.
+datum=WGS84
or
+ellps=WGS84

Sue,

I assume you mean "point_offset"?

int pj_transform( PJ *srcdefn, PJ *dstdefn, long point_count, int point_offset,
                   double *x, double *y, double *z )

In this case point_offset is the step size to use from one value to the
next in x, y and z arrays.  Normally this is 1, indicating that the values
are tightly packed one after the other.  But some folks have their values
in arrays of x/y/z interleaved, so they might pass a point_offset value
of three.

Paul,

I just tried:

cs2cs +proj=latlong +datum=WGS84 +to +proj=sterea +lat_0=52.15616055555555 
+lon_0=5.38763888888889 +k=0.9999079 +x_0=155000 +y_0=463000 +ellps=bessel 
+towgs84=565.040,49.910,465.840,-0.40939,0.35971,-1.86849,4.0772 +units=m +no_defs
5.5 51.5
162832.37       390114.67 -44.41

So the results seem agree closely to what you are expecting.  I'm not clear
on why you are getting different results.  Do you really have the closing
round braket after +no_defs?  What about the "from" coordinate system
for cs2cs?

Dag Paul,

Please see

http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2006-March/002168.html

for a working example of the parameters. Note that proj does not use 
datum shifts. you *have* to use cs2cs for that.

Subject: [Proj] Strange results utm to aeqd projection
Message-ID: <008301c7e880$f3e61ab0$f27c250a@BIG>

I just use cs2cs utility to transform point from utm to aeqd projection. Proj version is 4.4.9.

I have the following command line:
+proj=utm +zone=15 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +to +proj=aeqd +lat_0=-80 +lon_0=-100 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m
and  try to transform (484236, 5006526) point.
The result is (631024, 6129620). I suppose It's wrong.

Then I try  to transform point (631024, 6129620) with the same command line but with -I flag.  The result is (329673, -2729005). It's  all right.

Please, any suggestions?

Subject: [Proj] Specify a different directory for gsb files
Message-ID: <cb1bc4cf0708281118n21d041f7qc4ddadcbfbbdfe6c@mail.gmail.com>

Does any know how can i specify a different than the default folder
(c:\proj\nad) in order to cs2cs takes the gsb files when using NTV2 datum
shifting method?
I have been testing with the NTV2 datum shifting method and it works ok when
I put my national specific .gsb file under the default c:\proj\nad folder
(as you can see, i am under windows platform). However, I need to change the
default folder for the datum files because I have no permission to write on
c:\proj. When i put the .gsb file in a diferent folder, the NTV2
transformation is not done.
Do i need to recompile again? In that case, which file or files should i
edit and how?
Thanks in advance for your help.

Set the environment variable PROJ_LIB to the path where you're putting the GSB files.

Uff.. I cannot access to the configuration of the server... cannot set
environment variables nor writing at c:\proj
Any other idea?? I am completely knocked out.
Thanks for your help.

Ervin,

Well, what can you modify?  There are also build time things, and changes
that can be made in the code to modify this but it seems unlikely you can
apply such changes if you can't alter the environment.

Can you affect the cs2cs commandline?  (If so, why can't you set environment
variables!)  You can give a specific path a gsb file on the commandline
with the +nadgrids directive.

eg.
+nadgrids=D:\abc.gsb

The more I think about it, the more irritating it is that you ask this
question without explaining the constraints on your situation!

Best regards,

I would like to point out that my question makes a lot of sense...
Frank, i am using a hosting service where every user has assigned a
specified directory (for instance c:\users\...\...\user7771) and so we have
no administrative privileges. In addition, we are using a server side
scripting language to develop a guided interface to PROJ.4, so i do not
expect to be able to fix environment variables nor write on c:\proj
directly.

Anyway, on my servers, where i have all the administrative privileges, i've
been carrying some tests according to your recommendations:

- I tried to include in the command line the path to the gsb file: for
instance +nadgrids=c:\proj\xnad\myfile.gsb (notice that i have introduced
xnad instead of nad, and obviously renamed the nad folder to xnad
previosly). The RESULT DOES NOT WORK. Testing with some coordinates didn't
make the NTV2 datum shifting.
- I also tried to set a new environment variable form the DOS prompt, with
the sentence: set PROJ_LIB=C:\PROJ\XNAD. Afterwards, and also from the DOS
prompt, the sentence SET reports the successful creation of the variable
pointing at the specified path. In spite of all of this, the RESULT DOES NOT
WORK. Testing again with some coordinates, didn't make the NTV2 datum
shifting.

Any other idea? If the first option would work (to introduce the path of the
gsb file in the command line of cs2cs) it would be fine for me, because i am
using a shell to execute command line sentences through a server side
scripting languaje.

Thanks to both of you for your attention and responses.

Sorry, i must correct something...

The option of creating an environment variable works if you do not specify
the path of the file in the command line. I said that didn't work but is not
true. After some tests, i confirm that if you have set the variable to the
correct path, and use the options +nadgrids=myfile.gsb, PROJ makes the NTV2
transformation correctly.

Sorry for the mistake. Now i must enquire how to fix an environment variable
using ASP, and without administative privileges.
Any other ideas would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance for your help.
