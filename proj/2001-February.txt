Message-ID: <5.0.2.1.0.20010214170928.00a984a0@hans.as.op.dlr.de>

Dear Mr Warmerdam,

I am trying to generate the geod.dll and geod.exe for windows (PC: WinNT 
4.0 SP4). As you already explained to Andrew Larcombe (email from Dec, 1st 
2000), I also missed the def file. Now I got it from his email attachment.

But what I really would like to generate is geod.exe and geod.dll for 
Windows. In a first step I will call the geod.exe from my java application, 
in a second step I intend integrate geod.dll using the java native 
interface (faster and cleaner).

Did I get it right: you have a makefile for geod using microsoft visual c++ 
available by cvs for proj4 ?

Thanks in advance,
Susanne

Susanne,

Mr. Warmerdam,

I would like to port nad2nad (the NAD conversion utility for NAD27->NAD83)
to java. I would also like to implement in Oracle 8i with the spatial
project we are doing. I would be interested in hearing any comments,
thoughts, restrictions about doing. 

I would also like to ask the group if anyone has done this already.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] "projection initialization failure" Error
Message-ID: <NEBBLAJLMKPCCELCODMGIEIJCAAA.mdechaine@schaferdc.com>

Just a quick note to save someone else the trouble of solving the problem
that I had.

In short, when I ran the example from the man page, I got the following
errors:

$ proj +proj=utm +lon_0=112w -r
Rel. 4.4.2, 15 July 2000
<proj.exe>:
projection initialization failure
cause: major axis or radius = 0 or not given
program abnormally terminated

It took a while for me to figure out that I needed to specify an ellipsoid.
So, the following example works:

$ proj +proj=utm +lon_0=112w -r +ellps=clrk66
45d15'33.1"    111.5w
460769.27       5011648.45

So, it works now, but isn't there a default ellipsoid?  Well, after some
digging through the source (thank goodness for open source!) I found I
needed to set the PROJ_LIB environment variable so that proj would know
where to find the "proj_def.dat" file.  Then, it would find that clrk66 is
the default ellipsoid.  Might be nice to have a warning message that it
can't find the file, but I realize that would probably just add clutter to
the screen or output files.

Could the man page be changed to add the "+ellps=clrk66" parameter to the
example?  That might help some folks new to proj.

Anyway, many thanks for the proj library.  Looks like I'm going to be using
it quite a bit.

Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Projection problems at horizon
Message-ID: <5191D19AEF72D11186D8006097AE47B90871AB@NS>

Dear proj users,

I am experiencing a problem at the horizon while doing worldmap
projections.

For example, i take worldwide coastline data in Lat-Lon and i project
them using orthographic projection to create a view of the globe similar
to what one would see from space.

Instead of ending up with a graphic like the one in the proj
documentation, i end up with several lines that run from the horizon to
the center of the map.

No doubt what is happening is that if a coordinate is beyond the
horizon, it will be returned as zero by the projection formulae,
indicating that it is not visible. What i was hoping for is that these
coordinates would be "snapped" to the nearest visible point on the
horizon instead of the projection origin, thus avoiding these undesired
lines from the horizon to the center.

No need to say, the ortho projection is not the only one with this
behaviour and the results are even worse when i project a bunch of
country polygons...

I would imagine that i am not the first one trying to adress this
problem and would greatly appreciate suggestions/comments form other
proj.4 users.

Best Regards,

You are involved with a graphic problem, not a projection problem.
PROJ does not take care of projectable region boundaries other than
to indicate that the point is not projectable.  In other cases, the
point may be "wrapped" to the opposite side of the map when exceeding
180 from the central meridian.

Many of the illustrations in the PROJ.4 manuals involve use of special
programs that determine interuption points and perform necessary
graphic control in drafting the vectors.  Most of the illustrations that
only needed wrapping control were drafted with MAPGEN---
cylindrical, pseudocylindrical are examples.   Esoteric projections like
the obliques required special, unpublished procedures.

Further special graphic methods are required in generating
interrupted projections.

Graphic control software is not part of the PROJ.4 package
as distributed by the author.  Also, please do not request copies
of them as they are *very* "imaginative," with totally undocumented
methods and usage.  Using them requires experimentation and
twisting and tweeking for each particular projection case.

Gerald,

Thanks for your feedback, nice to see that you are still listening....

Basically you are right, it is a graphic problem and not a projection
problem.
It would be very difficult however to move the rejected points to the
horizon in a generic way without taking some care of this in the
projection algorithm itself. Then again, if during projection one
decided to move these points to the horizonm, doing an inverse
projection on the output would make these points end up at incorrect
lat-lon positions, which of course is exactly your point.

I would appreciate any information on ways to solve this graphic
problem, it is however not a major problem because making these nice
"globes" is less important to us than mapping some countries national
coordinate system properly ;-)

Thanks for the feedback,

Michael, 

I have added the +ellps=clrk66 to the example on the proj.1 man page.  I 
don't want to make the low level library complain if it doesn't find
proj_def.bat, because some applications uses the library without proj_def.dat.
It might make sense to make the command level programs (proj, cs2cs) report
a warning ... I will consider this in the future, but it isn't so obvious to
me how to do this.

Thanks for your bug report.
