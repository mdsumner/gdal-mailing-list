Subject: [Proj] Environment variable et proj.4 vb wrapper
Message-ID: <94e91cde0608010119v5432eaw9baea369b43561dc@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have wrote a little program in vb to download and upload GPS data. This
software use 2 specific functions to transform the data from WGS 84 to
Lambert 72 (Belgium) and from Lambert 72 to WGS 84. I want to replace these
functions by the proj.4 vb wrapper so I can use this software in other
contry than Belgium. I have test, without problem, this wrapper with the
file "exemple.mdb".

My problem is that I have Qgis installed and thus I have already a
"Proj_lib" environment variable. If user uninstall Qgis, the proj.4 is
uninstall. How can I have two versions of Proj.4 install on the same
computer. I have read than I can use pj_set_finder() or pj_set_searchpath()
to override this environment variable. This function is it available through
the vb wrapper ? If yes, how can I use this in vb ?

Thanks in advance.

That VB wrapper hasn't been updated to know about the
pj_set_searchpath() function.  I'm not sure if the pj_set_finder()
function will work.  You could try it.  See the AddressOf operator.  I
seem to recall it doesn't work due to calling convention issues.

If you can figure out how to change the PROJ_LIB environment variable
from within your VB program, that should work.  Just do it during
program startup before any proj.4 functions are called. Or, maybe, use a
batch file that launches your VB program and sets the PROJ_LIB
variable?

Message-ID: <2a8feb1c0608062125h2cc14e63t162fd945a15ec0b0@mail.gmail.com>

Dear All,

I want to obtain (lat, lon) of  a serials of points saved in a data
file. Before do that, I need to know how can I do it for one point.

The pionts came from Mecartor projection. Now, I have a reference
point (reflat, reflon), and the distance (kilometers) (x,y)
corresponding to same (reflat,reflon). How to calculate the unkowns
(?lat.?lon)? Can proj do it?



 ---(Reflat,reflon)-----------------(x)---------
              |                                   |

Unfortunately, [l]proj does not have a lat_0 option but this can be
compensated for in the following manner:

Assume the reference lat and lon are 45N and 160w respectively.  First
compute the northing for the latitude 45n:

lproj +proj=merc +ellps=intl
0 45

which gives:

0.00    5591388.07

For the remainder of the points, the run line will look like:

lproj +proj=merc +ellps=intl +lon_0=160 +y_0=-5591388.07 -I

For some sample data points (note: y negative south of reference latitude):

0 0
10000 10000
10000 -10000

the results would be:

160dE   45dN
160d5'23.381"E  45d3'49.31"N
160d5'23.381"E  44d56'10.433"N

The above example is the same for program proj.

I think you need some datum transformation parameters on your Lambert
projection.  See the +towgs84 parameter.  The EPSG database doesn't seem
to have any datum transformation information for that coordinate system.
 So, that may be the best you can expect...

... This is my first attempt to use proj4 and I don't know what I do wrong.
Here is the definition I use :
WGS 84 (epsg : 4326) : +proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +no_defs
no_defs <> 
Lambert 72 Belge (epsg : 31370) : +proj=lcc +lat_1=51.16666723333333

I don't do PROJ command lines, but it seems to me that you first have to
perform a datum transform from WGS84 to International for Belgium. This
can't be evoked with the epsg:4326 init since it has no transform
parameters. Find the complete transform parameters, check rotation model and
direction (from/to), supply the command line with a proper datum transform,
then project.

Belgium 1972 to WGS84:
translation in m, rotation in arcsec, scale in ppm.
Position vector rotation (PROJ)
dx=-99.059; dy=53.322; dz=-112.486; rx=0.419; ry=-0.83; rz=1.885; ds=-1.00;
Derived from ESRI ArcGIS parameters.

Going in the other direction, from wgs to intl, just negate all parameters.

Subject: [Proj] Trouble with a projection
Message-ID: <44F4B611.4090405@tesera.com>

Good afternoon,

Total newbie to proj... warning...danger...etc.

I am trying to use the following projection file in a MS4W mapfile.  To 
do so I have added it to the espg file in the proj libraries.  This 
seems to almost be working as below but I the reference latitute isn't 
included.  How would I modify that ESPG file entry to include a 
reference parallel.  Alternatively is there a resource would outlines 
all the variables you can use in such a file?  I don't even necessarily 
need to use the fake ESPG number in ESPG file combo.  Is there a 
resource that specifies all the parameters you can use to define a 
projection in a map file?

#<ESPG Entry>
<20851> +proj=lcc +lat_0=9.930000 +lon_0=-84.333333 +k_0=1 
+x_0=499784.42 +y_0=271970.62 +ellps=clrk66 +units=m +no_defs  no_defs <>
#</ESPG Entry>

Summarized:

*Lambert Norte*
Projection: Lambert Conic Conformal
Spheroid: Clarke 1866
Central Meridian: -84.33333...
Reference Latitude: 10.466666...
Standard Parallel1: 9.93

Please disregard that email.

I found an old post which listed:

I still don't know what a few of those are, but I was able to get my 
case to work using lat_1 lat_2 and lat_0.  It would be a nice reference 
to know exactly what each of those entries stands for and what 
constitutes a valid variable for each parameter.  It probably exists but 
I couldn't find it...  Just for configuring mapserver anyways...

Thanks.
Spence

Hello! I have MI CS and as far as I know, It uses projection under 26 MI code.  And I need to translate it to equal proj4 CS. But I have a problem, I don't know what proj4 projection is equal to my one. Projection's name is "Regional Mercator" and such options as ellipsoed, units,  Origin Longitude and Latitude are used to set this CS. Does proj4 supports this projection?

I have never heard of "regional mercator" but I don't know what MI and CS are 
either.  I think a little more specific description is needed or sample 
conversions for the specific projection constants you use.

Reply:

With this little information you can't expect a decent answer I'm afraid.
My guess is that is meant a regular Mercator projection with two standard
parallels with - usually - the first one at 60 or 70 degrees (choose one),
longitude of origin 0, datum WGS84, units meters. For reasons unknown to me
indeed called a Regional Mercator projection.
This is what I can make of some MapInfo documentation I have.
You can always ask the MapInfo forum (www.mapinfo.com)
