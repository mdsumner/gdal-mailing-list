Dear PSC,

I would like to nominate Alan Snow to the PSC. He has been driving a lot of API development through his pyproj software project, he provides careful code, considered opinions, and knows the software codebase of modern PROJ. 

Thanks for all of your contribution Alan!

Message-ID: <CAEMLSzWqixAQXVtXSb8-+YnLE4naaZP9QUdS5OB5k4VDozhZTA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

My paper "A variation on the Chamberlin trimetric map projection" was just
published in Cartography and Geographic Information Science:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15230406.2021.1975571 . If you
don't have institutional access, the preprint is on the GitHub repo linked
in the data availability statement. The paper heavily uses and refers to
PROJ, so I thought you all would be interested to hear about it.

The new map projection described in this paper was implemented as a patch
to PROJ. Would you be interested in including it? If so I can create a pull
request.

Subject: [PROJ] MGA94/MGA2020
Message-ID: <7a2f01d7b954$63aa1000$2afe3000$@kaarta.com>

Hello,

I have a set of ground control points provided by a surveyor in Australia
that were created in June 2020.

They are expressed in MGA94 / Zone 56 CRS, which I believe is EPSG:28356.

I would like to convert these points to MGA2020 (EPSG:7856) and relate them
to actual data coming from a Trimble GPS today.

Using PROJ7, I am able to get transformed values between MGA94 and MGA2020
that reflect the displacement of the Australian continent between those
CRSs, e.g. (using some round numbers to illustrate here)

 

echo 300000 6000000 0 | cs2cs +init=epsg:28356 +to +init=epsg:7856 -d 3

300000.435          6000001.421 0.000

 

However, in comparing the results to current readings from the GPS,  I see
they're off by what may be the continental drift that's occurred in the last
15 months - about 8 cm northeast.

I know PROJ7 knows about time-dependent transformations, I just can't seem
to figure out how to use that to get my GCP coordinates in today's MGA2020
grid. I've naively tried

 

echo 300000 6000000 0 2020.5 | cs2cs +init=epsg:28356 +to +init=epsg:7856 -d
3

300000.435          6000001.421 0.000 2020.5

 

but it comes up with the same numbers. 

Do I need to construct a more elaborate pipeline, and is this even something
cs2cs can be used for?
Any tips or tricks would be appreciated! As you might have guessed, I'm
pretty much a novice with PROJ7.

Thanks,

Henning Pangels

Henning,

both GDA94 and GDA2020 are "static" CRS, that is coordinates are not 
time dependent in any of those, so it is expected that specifying the 
coordinate epoch in such transformations has no impact.

There are known time-dependent transformation between GDA94 and ITRF2014 
or GDA2020 and ITRF2014. Your GPS probably outputs coordinates in WGS 84 
(G1762) (or maybe another realization), but you may perhaps try to 
assume that ITRF2014 and that WGS 84 are equivalent for your purposes.

Then you can for example use

$ echo 300000 6000000 0 2020.5 | cs2cs -d 8 EPSG:28356 EPSG:9000

-36.12408288??? 150.77761389 -0.09245914 2020.5


You can also build a "ITRF2014 / Map Grid of Australia zone 56" 
projection by using 
"urn:ogc:def:crs,crs:EPSG::9000,cs:EPSG::4400,coordinateOperation:EPSG::17356"

(EPSG:9000 referes to the geographic CRS ITRF2014, EPSG:4400 to the 
easting/northing coordinate system, and EPSG:17356 to the conversion 
method for MGA56)

Then

$ echo 300000 6000000 0 2020.5 | cs2cs -d 8 EPSG:28356 
urn:ogc:def:crs,crs:EPSG::9000,cs:EPSG::4400,coordinateOperation:EPSG::17356
300000.44233932??? 6000001.44797768 -0.09245914 2020.5

(you might get slightly different results if the GDA94 to GDA2020 grid 
is present)

Agreed, but even worse:

  If your receiver is not doing differential it will output "WGS84(G1762)
  current epoch".

  If it is doing differential (apparently no SBAS there) it will output
  in the frame of the differential system.  I think US WAAS, not
  relevant in .au, is in IRTF2008, but it's remarkably hard to find that
  out.  

  Each ITRF has a normal reference epoch, and if you are worried about
  the 7 cm/year motion of .au, you may want to pay attention to that.

  If you aren't doing short-baseline differential or RTK, then this may
  not really matter.  If you are, I would not be surprised if your
  coordinates are in GDA2020.  As an example, RTK in the US is typically
  in "NAD83(2011) epoch 2010.0" which is our national
  more-or-less-plate-fixed datum.

I don't get to vote, but I'm opposed.  I've been doing packaging for a
lot of things, and have experienced more trouble with cmake builds.

Right now I'm trying to find out why "make check" in geos is broken;
it's using the installed library rather than the ones that were just
built.  Reading the verbose builds, I can't see how this is supposed to
work.  I can only guess how it might work in some circumstances.

I've was a happy user of the CMake config for Proj when I was doing a lot
of work with it a couple of years ago.

To echo the comment on bazel:

I have my own local bazel based build of Proj.  I don't see a reason for
the Proj project to need to do anything to support those of use who build
with bazel.  The cc_library rule is pretty much just "glob" calls
expressing where the srcs, hdrs, and textual_hders are to be found.  I
think bazel is not a good choice for the main Proj repo.

Bazel was mentioned as an example of a modern build system that has
gained some traction (thanks, Google!):
https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?cat=31&date=all&q=cmake,bazel,meson,autotools

I first encountered CMake 10 years ago and thought it was rubbish.
So-called "Modern CMake" advancements and paradigms (i.e.
https://cliutils.gitlab.io/modern-cmake/) have helped its adoption. My
point is it's difficult to predict what build system will be popular
and fit-for-purpose in another decade from now, so I'd be hesitant to
say CMake will be the only build system from now on. Whatever it is,
it needs to be reliable and cross-platform to work equally on (e.g.)
NetBSD or MS Windows.

Message-ID: <CADRrdKuZ0N-tK2fx8=Qmd5UjjJFCD-sMjxPX6rfs8v_o2JinUA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Reading the axes of EPSG:21781 https://epsg.org/crs_21781/CH1903-LV03.html
(Switzerland) I found something strange:
    CS[Cartesian,2],
        AXIS["easting (Y)",east,
            ORDER[1],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],
        AXIS["northing (X)",north,
            ORDER[2],
            LENGTHUNIT["metre",1]],

The first axis is east... however the abbreviation is "Y". Is there any
reason for that? Is it just a mistake in EPSG data? I have the impression
that I should ignore that abbreviation, and relay only on the direction.
But it is getting hard ;)

Thanks.

I don't think that's a mistake. The choice of abbreviations is indeed 
somewhat random, or might depend on local usages. Using the direction 
will be more robust.

Indeed I asked a similar question to Roger Lott from EPSG a while ago. I 
confirmed that there is various abbreviation conventions for projected 
CRS around the world and that we can not expect a single convention to 
apply everywhere. The EPSG database reflect those various usages.

Axis abbreviation should not be used for identifying axis directions. 
The direction code list at the end of AXIS element is what should be used.

Dear colleagues
I can confirm that the axis of LV03 are correct.
By the way - in older classical geodetic books the axis names were switched compared to the classical mathematical notation.
LV03 is the old system which is no longer used  for geodata sets in Switzerland since about 3 years (but in some cases still used due to a history of more than 100 years).
Best regards

Hi

I have developed a simple webpage to search coordinate reference systems
based on PROJ data. It includes a map where you can click a location,
filtering the systems that has this location in their area of use.

https://jjimenezshaw.github.io/crs-explorer/

There are a couple of ideas to add in the backlog. But I hope it is already
useful.

Cheers,
Javier.

Javier,

Thanks! It is much faster than the epsg.org map search and it provides codes of other authorities too. That will save me a lot of time. Personally I would prefer the links to epsg.org to point to the human readable browse report instead of the WKT string to save me the additional mouse click.

However, the thing I?m missing most in epsg.org is the possibility to find the transformation codes associated with a specific CRS code easily. Do you have ideas on how that could be made easier too?

Regards, Jochem

That would be the great. Unfortunately I do not know how to construct that
link. The link to the WKT has just the code number. I could try to figure
out the rule to convert the CRS name to that URL.

 What I did was pre-produce a json using pyproj.database.query_crs_info,
that later is read by the webpage. If I understand correctly what you
suggest, that would need another query to the database, that is not
currently available in pyproj.

Jochem,
I think I found the pattern for the EPSG url (not difficult), and changed
the link. If you find any link that does not work, please, let me know.

Nice work!

Something similar: https://pypi.org/project/projpicker/

as a Python package and a GRASS GIS Module.

Kind regards

Hi

On October 2021, in a thread in gdal mailing list about searching in the
list of posts, Jeff said:

"Hi Matt!

I just use Google search to query the archives:
- goto https://google.ca
- in the search box enter:    site:lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/
yoursearchterm

This may not always contain the latest archives (depending on the speed
of Google-mothership bots), but I find it very helpful.

-jeff"

That worked pretty well with gdal mailing list.

However it does not work so well with proj
I tried
https://www.google.com/search?q=site:lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj+doxygen
"Your search - *site:lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj
<http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj> doxygen* - did not match any
documents."   O_O

... I was looking for this post about doxygen
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2021-April/010207.html

Could be that we have something blocking the search bots? Or is Google just
ignoring me (I wouldn't be surprised)?
I looked at the "robots" html meta tags since lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj,
and it seems to be ok to me.

Thanks

Interesting. I guess there is nothing that say which planet/moon it applies to.

Hi,

That's strange. It looks like some older threads have been indexed, but more recent ones haven't. Try, for example `site:lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj noaa vdatum`.

I also noticed Google acting strangely lately, like taking two weeks to index a new page (it's supposed to take 1-2 days or so).

Then there's DDG, which returns more results, but still not the one you were looking for. Weird.

Laurentiu

Subject: [PROJ] promoteTo3D in ftUS
Message-ID: <CADRrdKsRwKNgxw3bpvAoRZQtoSOA-5yA8T=W-x3Eicer8FFiwQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

There is currently a method

CRSNNPtr CRS::promoteTo3D(const std::string &newName,
                          const io::DatabaseContextPtr &dbContext) const

that adds vertical axis in Meters (if there is no one there, etc).

Sometimes (when working with CRS from USA), I need the vertical one in ft
or ftUS.

There is another function
CRSNNPtr CRS::promoteTo3D(const std::string &newName,
                          const io::DatabaseContextPtr &dbContext,
                          const cs::CoordinateSystemAxisNNPtr
                              &verticalAxisIfNotAlreadyPresent) const

but it is "PROJ_INTERNAL" (whatever it means)

Would it make sense to have a function (or overload) that specifies the
unit?

Thanks.

promoteTo3D() will create a Geographic3D CRS or a Projected 3D CRS, ie 
with ellipsoidal heights, not orthometric height. Are ellipsoidal 
heights in ft/ftUS really what you need ?

Just that it restricts a method from being exported in a class that is 
exported. I tend to be conservative of what I expose in the API if I'm 
not sure it will be needed by external users.

If that's the function you need, just removing PROJ_INTERNAL, moving it 
in the public part and adding doc should be enough.

The CRS::alterCSLinearUnit() method could also be useful.

Thanks. alterCSLinearUnit() seems to be a good option.

I tried with Google, Bing and DuckDuckGo. None is finding them.

Can I talk with the admin of the domain/server? There is something strange,
and it is very inconvenient not being able to search. One problem is people
(including me) asking again the same things, because they do not find the
answer in any Search Engine.

Thanks.

Subject: [PROJ] Behavior of proj_create_crs_to_crs() when using +proj=utm
 format
Message-ID: <CAFemY3a-2hbrDnquyKR1GbP2Yw2Cysiox-p-iXFL1hE2ssNj6w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello:

I'm using PROJ 8.1.1 from the Debian Sid repositories, and I'm having
troubles with proj_create_crs_to_crs() using a code that worked
without problems with PROJ 7.2.1.

My example, attached as tproj.c projects a point from (lat,lon) onto
the UTM zone 30 plane. I use the proj_trans_generic() function, but in
a first case I define the projection using the proj_create() function
with parameters "+proj=utm +lon_0=3w +ellps=GRS80". In this case all
works fine, as the UTM zone 30 is defined but its central meridian
+lon_0=3w.

But in my second example I define a transformation between CRSs using
the function proj_create_crs_to_crs(), and the parameter strings
"+proj=latlong +ellps=GRS80" and "+proj=utm +lon_0=3w +ellps=GRS80",
and the problem comes with +lon_0=3w. I need to define the parameter
string as "+proj=utm +zone=30 +ellps=GRS80", case in which all works
well. But why proj_create_crs_to_crs() works with +zone=30 and fails
with +lon_0=3w if both definitions are equivalent for the UTM, and it
works using proj_create()?

Also the error string created with proj_errno_string() is confusing,
as it returns "Unknown error (code 4096)", but at the same the string
"proj_create: Invalid zone number" is printed on screen. I think this
last message will be returned by proj_errno_string(). Also, in this
string proj_create() is referred instead of proj_create_crs_to_crs().

Attached I send the code

Thanks

Hi,

it is a bit tricky.

wen you use proj_create() with a PROJ string without +type=crs, it goes 
(almost) directly through the "historic" code of PROJ, which interprets 
its as a coordinate transformation string, and I indeed discover by 
looking at it that it accepts +lon_0 as an alternative to +zone (but if 
you don't specify something that is an expected longitude of natural 
origin for UTM, then it will round to the closest without warning...). 
But https://proj.org/operations/projections/utm.html only documents +utm 
as a required parameter, so that is a bit of a chance that it works.

When you use proj_create_crs_to_crs(), PROJ strings are interpretated as 
CRS, which goes to a different code path, and that code path enforces 
that +zone is specified, now to a valid value.

Regarding error messages, yeah, this is a bit tricky and linked to the 
interaction of the C and C++ parts of the code. Basically the "Invalid 
zone number" is emitted as a C++ exception without a specific C error 
code, then it is caught by proj_create() which emits it as a logged 
error (proj_create() is called by proj_create_crs_to_crs()), and the 
generic PROJ_ERR_OTHER=4096 is set because the code that catch the C++ 
exception has no better hint.

Thanks for your complete answer, Even. Only for curiosity (and without
any criticism), why PROJ moved part of the code from the beautiful and
practical C language to the ugly C++? I hope at least the C interface
will be forever maintained.

You're coming late to the party. That was discussed in the thread at 
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/proj/2018-May/007799.html

yep C++ can be ugly, but good luck with memory management if you want to 
implement ISO:19111 in C. Oh well, you could certainly do that, but it 
would be extremely verbose and error prone.

| I hope at least the C interface will be forever maintained.

Yes, as long as C remains something available and used.

Message-ID: <138C5AA4-7782-4366-B42A-2012EC4C3DC7@gmail.com>

All,

We?re closing in on the release date for the next PROJ version and hence I have prepared
release candidates for both PROJ 8.2.0 and PROJ-data 1.8.

The PROJ release includes a number of new features and bug fixes. See the release notes
below. The release candidates can be downloaded via the following links:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-8.2.0RC1.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-8.2.0RC1.zip

The PROJ-data release adds two new grid files:

- SAGEOID2010, South African geoid
- GGM10, Mexican geoid model

and can be downloaded here:

http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-data-1.8RC1.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/proj/proj-data-1.8RC1.zip

Please test the release candidates and report back your findings either here on the
mailing list in an issue on GitHub. Your feedback is appreciated.

Note that RFC 7 has been adopted which means that the 8.2 branch will be the last
which offer the option of building PROJ with autotools. From version 9.0.0 CMake
builds will be the only option. I encourage everyone to start adapting their build
workflows accordingly.

/Kristian

??????????????????????????????

8.2.0 Release Notes
-------------------

 Announcements
 -------------

 From PROJ 9.0.0 and onwards CMake will be the only build system bundled
 with the PROJ package. As a consequence support for Autotools builds will
 stop when the 8.2 branch of PROJ reaches end of life. We encourage
 everyone to adjust their build workflows as soon as possible and report
 any discrepancies discovered between Autotools and CMake builds.

 Details about the build system unification can be found in PROJ RFC 7.

   are several alternative transformations (#2867)

 o CRS::identify(): fix ignoring CS order when identifying a geodetic CRS
   by a PROJ string with just the ellipsoid (#2881)

 o Fix CRS Equality with PROJ parameter order (#2887)

 o WKT concatenated operation parsing: fix when a axis order reversal conversion
   is the first or last operation (#2891)

 o WKT1 parser: recognize Lambert_Conformal_Conic as projection name for
   LCC 1SP or 2SP (#2893)

 o CMake: Always build gie if testing is requested (#2899)

 o Geographic 3D CRS: allow to export to WKT1:ESRI if only the GEOGCS is known
   (and thus extrapolating a VERTCS) (#2902)

 o lib_proj.cmake: add a PROJ::proj alias and add BUILD_INTERFACE include
   directories, so that proj can be used as a subdirectory of a larger
   project (#2913)

Subject: [PROJ] Reusing formatter object
Message-ID: <CADRrdKvLe7g1N_z=BHVVRDzjz8JGJS9TJ71izD+SzhkXLU7xRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Can I use a formatter object from the class
osgeo::proj::io::PROJStringFormatter many times?

in the transformation from LV_95 (EPSG:2056) to WGS84 the method
"ConcatenatedOperation::operations()" is giving me two operations. If I use
the same formatter object I get this:

operation:
+proj=pipeline
  +step +inv +proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524055555556 +lon_0=7.43958333333333
+k_0=1
        +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +ellps=bessel
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

operation:
+proj=pipeline
    +step +inv +proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524055555556 +lon_0=7.43958333333333
          +k_0=1 +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +ellps=bessel
    +step +proj=push +v_3
    +step +proj=cart +ellps=bessel
    +step +proj=helmert +x=674.374 +y=15.056 +z=405.346
    +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84
    +step +proj=pop +v_3
    +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg
    +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

What I was expecting is (what I get if I create a new formatter each time)

operation:
+proj=pipeline
  +step +inv +proj=somerc +lat_0=46.9524055555556 +lon_0=7.43958333333333
+k_0=1
        +x_0=2600000 +y_0=1200000 +ellps=bessel
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

operation:
+proj=pipeline
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +xy_out=rad
  +step +proj=push +v_3
  +step +proj=cart +ellps=bessel
  +step +proj=helmert +x=674.374 +y=15.056 +z=405.346
  +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84
  +step +proj=pop +v_3
  +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +xy_out=deg
  +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

The only difference is to create the formatter object outside or inside the
for loop that iterates ConcatenatedOperation::operations()

auto formatter =
osgeo::proj::io::PROJStringFormatter::create(osgeo::proj::io::PROJStringFormatter::Convention::PROJ_5,
dbContext);
formatter->setMultiLine(true);

Is that expected? I do not see any method like "clear" or "reset" to remove
any previous data.
Note: it is not a problem if it is intended (now that I know the effect).
But it confused me trying to understand how
ConcatenatedOperation::operations() works.

Thanks

No, a single instance of PROJStringFormatter can be used just for a 
single object to export. Patch welcome to improve its doc

Subject: [PROJ] Transforming coordinates in C++
Message-ID: <CADRrdKsO_bv0WxF1mnZ-rcT3cZayQ_-9qWA3oQN0GZqiauJRFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

Using C++ I am trying this: Given two CRSs, I would like to have access to
the list of possible transformations (like with projinfo), and use those
transformations to transform coordinates (like with cs2cs).

Studying the code of projinfo, that uses mainly the C++ API, I already have
a std::vector<CoordinateOperationNNPtr>. Nice, I can dump them in different
formats.

However, when I go to the code of cs2cs, I see that it is mainly using the
C API.

Is there any C++ equivalent to the function
PJ_COORD proj_trans (PJ *P, PJ_DIRECTION direction, PJ_COORD coord);
?

Thanks.

No.

If you know which transformation you want to do, what you can easily do 
is exportToPROJString() it, and use proj_create() to instanciate it as a 
PJ* object you can use with proj_trans()

That's more or less what proj_create_operations() + proj_list_get() do.

Thanks Even.

I see that proj_create takes a PJ_CONTEXT *ctx as the first argument. What
I have in C++ is a DatabaseContextPtr. Can I get a PJ_CONTEXT* from a
DatabaseContextPtr?

I don't see a getter for it currently.? It can be optionally passed in 
the DatabaseContext::create() factory method (DatabaseContext doesn't 
strictly require a PJ_CONTEXT*. From what I can see it is only needed to 
find proj.db and grid files, and if none is provided the default context 
is used. I hope this is safe enough in multi threaded uses. hum...), so 
if there was one, you already knew it through other means, but it 
wouldn't hurt if you added a getter. Or you create one from scratch.? 
All this is a testimony of the ISO-19111 part having being mostly 
developed as an addition besides the traditional C code base, and the 
connection between the two parts being a bit tricky.

No issues with the two release candidates have been reported, so I hereby motion
that the candidates be promoted to final. I?ll start with my +1.
