Subject: [PROJ] alterCSLinearUnit for BoundCRS
Message-ID: <CADRrdKu-+z1bSorn=LGs1v1gCMrxxepehsidkZmvom1-u+gaFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am considering to make a PR that implements alterCSLinearUnit for
BoundCRS (as far as I understand, it is not covered). My question is: is it
enough to apply alterCSLinearUnit to the baseCRS, leaving the hubCRS and
transformation the same? I would say so, but I do not know if there is any
side effect I am missing.

The use case I am thinking about: having a bound 2D (projected) system in
something that is not meters (let's say foot). Then if I do promoteTo3D,
the vertical will be meters, and I want to change the units to the same as
the horizontal ones. It works fine for projected, but not yet for bound.

Thanks.

Yes, I believe you should only touch the baseCRS of the boundCRS. At 
least if the baseCRS is a projected CRS, based on 
http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html#149: "If the 
source CRS type is projected and the abridged coordinate transformation 
operates in the geodetic CRS domain, the transformation is deemed to 
operate on the projected CRS's base CRS but the projected CRS shall be 
described."

Said otherwise, the conversion & coordinate system of the projected CRS 
are not taken into account for the coordinate operation described by the 
boundCRS. Only the (base) geographicCRS of the projectedCRS is.

Even

PS:

The "interesting" case would be a BoundCRS with baseCRS = Geographic3D 
CRS (let's say ETRS89 3D) , targetCRS = Geographic 3D CRS (let's say 
WGS84 3D) and transformation = some Helmert. If you had the crazy idea 
of altering the vertical unit of the ellipsoidal height to be feet (hum, 
is that crazy? who knows what non-metric folks can do :-)) for the 
baseCRS, I'm not sure at all PROJ would do. I guess the expected 
behaviour when transforming between such baseCRS with feet vertical unit 
and the targetCRS would be first to apply feet -> meter and then chain 
with the Helmert transformation. Perhaps this is what we do currently.

actually, checking... yes this works:

$ projinfo -s "+proj=longlat +ellps=GRS80 +towgs84=1,2,3 +vunits=ft 
+type=crs" -t EPSG:4979

PROJ string:
+proj=pipeline
 ? +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=deg +z_in=ft +xy_out=rad +z_out=m
 ? +step +proj=cart +ellps=GRS80
 ? +step +proj=helmert +x=1 +y=2 +z=3
 ? +step +inv +proj=cart +ellps=WGS84
 ? +step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=rad +z_in=m +xy_out=deg +z_out=m
 ? +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1

Subject: [PROJ] Vertical grid transformation / ellipsoidal height to EGM2008
 (EPSG 3855)
Message-ID: <CABZ8+BCznnt3-K4okuQR5w0zEMELFXDm4KhaPRjKeOLEXfMncA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear PROJ community,
I am using a GNSS (Emlid REACH RS2 )to collect ground control points for
drone mapping and supporting a project of monitoring vegetation after fire.
I have collected data in LAT,LON (CRS EPSG 4326) and ellipsoidal height (m)
and would like to transform it to another CRS. Target horizontal is EPSG:
25831 and target height is based on EGM2008 (EPSG 3855).

I just discovered PROJ and I am having issues with the vertical
transformation.

Using Linux Ubuntu 11 and installed PROJ using anaconda with:

<conda install -c conda-forge proj>

<conda install -c conda-forge proj-data>

I tested with:

<echo -2.69713764 43.37551925 | cs2cs +init=epsg:4326 +to +init=epsg:25830>

which outputs: -2.69713764 43.37551925 which is fine.

However, I don't understand very well how to perform the vertical grid
shift.

I tried:

1. <echo -2.69713764 43.37551925 102.635| cs2cs +init=epsg:4326 +vgridshift
 +to +init=epsg:25830 +grids=egm08_25.gtx>

2.<echo -2.69713764 43.37551925 102.635 | proj +init=epsg:4326
+proj=vgridshift +grids=egm08_25.gtx>

But the first try ignores the height and the second got me an error message:

"can't initialize operations that produce angular output coordinates
program abnormally terminated"

Thank you for your help,

Inti

That RTK device should not produce vales in WGS84. The coordinates you
provide are in Spain. I would assume that the reference system used by the
base stations is ETRS89 (2D: EPSG:4258 , 3D EPSG:4937).
In addition to that, Spain has its own vertical CRS, Alicante height,
EPSG:5782
So probably your source CRS would be EPSG:4937 and destination
EPSG:25830+5782

This is working for me:
Using from WGS84 3D to EPSG:25830 + EGM2008
echo 43.37551925 -2.69713764 102.635 | PROJ_NETWORK=ON cs2cs EPSG:4979
EPSG:25830+3855
524534.95 4802561.48 53.07

Using from ETRS89 3D to EPSG:25830 + Alicante height
echo 43.37551925 -2.69713764 102.635 | PROJ_NETWORK=ON cs2cs EPSG:4937
EPSG:25830+5782
524534.95 4802561.48 53.72

PROJ_NETWORK=ON is not needed if proj-data is properly installed.

Modern solution:

$ echo 43.37551925 -2.69713764 102.635| cs2cs -d 3 EPSG:4979 EPSG:25830+3855
524534.955??? 4802561.478 53.074

Not that when using the EPSG:xxx syntax (and not the legacy 
+init=epsg:xxxx one), you need to specify input coordinates in the order 
they are expected by the official definition of the CRS, here latitude, 
longitude, as for all geographic CRS under the EPSG authority (you can 
check the axis order by looking at the WKT output with "projinfo 
EPSG:4979")

You could also get that result with the legacy syntax with:

$ echo -2.69713764 43.37551925 102.635| cs2cs -d 3 +init=epsg:4979 +to 
+init=epsg:25830 +geoidgrids=egm08_25.gtx
524534.955??? 4802561.478 53.074

or using the epsg:4326 code but forcing it to 3d:

$ echo -2.69713764 43.37551925 102.635| cs2cs -d 3 --3d +init=epsg:4326 
+to +init=epsg:25830 +geoidgrids=egm08_25.gtx
524534.955??? 4802561.478 53.074

Sorry for the Ubuntu mistake, my version is 20.04.

I got coordinates in WGS84 + ellipsoid height since my data was a result of
a PPK process (using as base, one of the correction network) using Emlid
studio and currently, coordinates come like this but thank you for the
clarification regarding the available CRS in Spain and the Alicante height
I was not aware of.

I tested all your proposed solutions and all worked fine on my computer. I
learned a lot, thank you!!

Subject: [PROJ] How to use the tag GEOIDMODEL
Message-ID: <CADRrdKtn4AiFxGo0SP5ZwrzHxCsERXO3rcp5tByYaj7Jf9mQRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

When there are several geoid models for a vertical system, is there a way
to force in WKT2 to use a specific one?
I know in the US I can use the values in the geoid_model table (for
instance using the method AuthorityFactory::getGeoidModels), GEOID18 or
GEOID12B. Or GGM10 for Mexico, that also uses NAVD88.
        GEOIDMODEL["GEOID18"]

However there are other places where those geoid models are not added to
the proj.db database, like
fr_ign_RAF18.tif: France, IGN France, RGF93 (EPSG:4965) to NGF-IGN69 height
(EPSG:5720)
and
fr_ign_RAF09.tif: France, IGN France, RGF93 (EPSG:4965) to NGF-IGN69 height
(EPSG:5720)

Even Rouault mentioned some time ago that the epsg.org purpose of that
field was to set not just a name, but the transformation id itself, as
shown in http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/18-010r7/18-010r7.html , section
10.4
        GEOIDMODEL["CGG2013",ID["EPSG",6648]]

So to force the French vertical crs to use one or the other we should write
something like
        GEOIDMODEL["RAF09",ID["EPSG",8371]]
or
        GEOIDMODEL["RAF18",ID["EPSG",8885]]

Is that right? Is that working in PROJ 9.1.0? I tried in cs2cs, but the
output was identical. The log showed that both were using raf18 tif file.
Could it have many entries to choose one automatically? I see in the table
geoid_model that there are several "operation_code" for the same "name",
and PROJ chooses one.

I was looking the code trying to understand how the tag GEOIDMODEL is used
in a transformation, but didn't get anything.

Thanks.

PS I do not know how many vertical systems can use different geoid models,
nor what may happen in the future when some countries update their geoid
models.

Yes, currently that will not work

The relevant code is in 
src/iso19111/operation/coordinateoperationfactory.cpp at the bottom of 
createOperationsGeogToVertFromGeoid() method.

 ??????? const auto &models = vertDst->geoidModel();
 ??????? for (const auto &model : models) {
 ??????????? const auto &modelName = model->nameStr();
 ??? ??? ??? const auto transformations =
 ??????????????? [...]
 ??????????????????? : authFactory->getTransformationsForGeoid(
 ????????????????????????? modelName,
context.context->getUsePROJAlternativeGridNames());

So it uses the AuthorityFactory::getTransformationsForGeoid() method, 
which queries the geoid_model database table, to find which operations 
are associated with a geoid model name.
When this returns an empty set, createOperationsGeogToVertFromGeoid() 
should probably fallback to querying for a transformation by name using 
modelName (assuming official names like "RGF93 v2 to NGF-IGN69 height 
(2)" are used), and probably start by instantiating from the 
identifier(s) (returned by model->identifiers()) (EPSG:8371) associated 
with the model object when it is avaiable. Both can be done with 
respectively the createObjectsFromName() and createCoordinateOperation() 
methods of AuthorityFactory.

Yes, PROJ will apply its usual logic (don't ask me to explain in detail 
what it is!, or rather use 
https://proj.org/operations/operations_computation.html as a first order 
approximation of what it does) to select /sort when there are several 
operation candidates.

This is not a question but a request.

I had to work out an API to convert from GPS coordinates to Height above
MSL. Having made it work, I wrote a blog post about the solution, since I
like to document things. I have posted it here for three reasons :

 1 As a thank you to the team. The simplicity of the actual solution shows
just how good PROJ is!

2 In case you want a good laugh, and

3 more seriously, given the impressive competence on this list, I would
like to know if I have made any glaring (or even subtle) mistakes.

Thank you

Paul,

Great post.

I've noticed you point to the https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/geoids/ 
page which mentions they use the PROJ GTG format. A lot of their files 
have the same names as the ones provided by https://cdn.proj.org/ , but 
they are not exactly the same... Looking at au_ga_AUSGeoid98.tif, it 
appears they have reprocessed them to modify the TIFFTAG_COPYRIGHT 
(removing the license information) and TIFFTAG_IMAGEDESCRIPTION. Also 
adding the nodata value tag (PROJ grids only contain it when they are 
actual grid values at the nodata value). And more annoying they have 
also modified the GDAL_METADATA tag in a way it is not currently 
understood by current GDAL versions (adding the <?xml version="1.0" 
encoding="UTF-8"?> marker before the root <GDALMetadata> element, 
whereas GDAL expects the string to start directly with <GDALMetadata>), 
so the GTG specific metadata is hidden. I'm going to fix the GDAL 
GeoTIFF reader to be more robust to that.

I've also noticed that the dk_sdfe_dvr90.tif file they provide is quite 
different from the PROJ CDN: it has not the same extent and spatial 
resolution.

A bit annoying to reuse the same file names as the ones we provide but 
with different content.

Anyway this is rather for any Agisoft employee reading this email....

I just pointed to them as an example - primarily because the USNA site does.

I will remove the example from the post as potentially confusing ...

I recommend to link to the official EPSG.org website instead of epsg.io which uses an outdated copy of the registry.
