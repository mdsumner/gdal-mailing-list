The latest version of GeographicLib, 1.27, includes a straight C
implementation of the geodesic routines plus sample programs for solving
the direct and inverse geodesic problems.  Download the source
distribution from

http://sf.net/projects/geographiclib/files/distrib/GeographicLib-1.27.tar.gz

and look in the legacy/C directory.  The API is documented at the
beginning of geodesic.h .

This version also includes Fortran, Python, Javascipt, and Matlab
implementations.  The Matlab implementation is also available from

   http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/39108

and the Python implementation is also available from

   http://pypi.python.org/pypi/geographiclib

Message-ID: <50BFE448.5070409@pobox.com>

Folks,

At the request of Howard Butler, I have upgraded PROJ.4, libgeotiff, and
GDAL to use the EPSG 8.0 database in development "trunk".

This was accomplished, as usual based on the process described here:

   http://svn.osgeo.org/metacrs/geotiff/trunk/libgeotiff/csv/README

Amoung other things this will result in some datums having new preferred
datum shift solutions.  Upgrade with care.

Best regards,

Unfortunately, EPSG have just moved to version 8.1, but the download 
link at their website is not (yet) working for the database.
However, links to postgis and other sql files are working.

André,

Doh!  Bad timing on my part.  Well, I think I'll make another pass shortly
upgrading to 8.1 before the GDAL 1.10 release and before I do a new PROJ.4
release.  I'll add a calendar item for me to check this in a week or two.

Best regards,
Frank

Message-ID: <50C5173F.4030506@gmx.de>

Hi all,

may I ask for your help about how to use cs2cs.

I got some sample data from southern Germany which (probably) comes in
Gauß-Krüger format.

A single sample point would be
  WGS84: 49.737475,11.88695
  GK:    4491957.175 5511210.407
These values were computed by an online tool.

When I try to convert from GK to WGS84, I guess I have to use:
 cs2cs +init=/usr/local/share/proj/world:gk4-d +towgs84
the result is
 56d30'44.77"E	39d38'19.023"N 0.000

That's far away. Another online example names:
 cs2cs +init=epsg:31466 +to +init=epsg:4326

which returns even worse:
 32d6'20.91"E	46d39'54.638"N 16.676

I guess what I do is completely wrong. But I do not find the description
yet how to do it properly.

Please help,
Martin

This use of cs2cs is not correct. You must run something like:

cs2cs *string_for_system_1* +to* string_for_system2*

The +towgs84=... is the part of a string that you use to give datum
parameters of that system

The EPSG code 31466 is for GK zone 2. Your X coordinate is very large, so
it is more likely that the point is in a different zone, probably 4, which
has a false easting of 4500 km. In that case you get:

echo 4491957.175 5511210.407 | cs2cs +init=epsg:31468 +to +init=epsg:4326
11d53'13.028"E  49d44'14.871"N 48.659

At least this point is in Germany... The datum transformation parameters
used are the following:
+towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.7

31466 is GK2, you should use EPSG:31468.

Correct syntax is

cs2cs +init=epsg:31468 +to +init=epsg:4326 in.txt >>out.txt

With in.txt containing the coordinates in Format East North

That's not what I did? I thought that
	+init=/usr/local/share/proj/world:gk4-d
would be system1 and that
	+towgs84
would include the system2 part.

I had missed 314666 vs. 31468, although I used gk4 above.

That's close enough to
 11.88695229	49.73746425 (here)
 11.88695	49.737475   (from a known opposite conversion)

But what's the third part of the output line? I did not mind as long as
it was 0.000, but I do not see it documented.

That's done automagically? Or do I have to apply this anywhere?

I'm just lost in the docu, where to find the epsg ids, how to apply
towgs84 and and how to read the output.

Thanks!

No. +towgs84 is not the same as +to +init=epsg:4326
Using EPSG codes, the +towgs84 is hidden inside the code number.

Thats the height above the ellipsoids surface. You can ignore it.

It is implemented in EPSG:31468 (if you have a current proj), but not in 
world:gk4-d.

Found it now in epsg:<4326>, while there seem to be many others withn
the same behavior.

Hm, I thought I got the latest release Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012
- but mine does show
# DHDN / 3-degree Gauss-Kruger zone 4
<31468> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=12 +k=1 +x_0=4500000 +y_0=0
+datum=potsdam +units=m +no_defs  <>

... and I would have expected that the "to" wgs84 would not apply for
the from (system 1).

Thanks!

+datum=potsdam is nothing else, only better human-readable.

It applies for all ellipsoids that are not identically located to the 
standard WGS84 ellipsoid. It describes the offset from an ellipsoids 
center to that of WGS84 ellipsoid: the first three in coordinate axis 
X,Y,Z (from the earths center), the next three rotations around those 
axis, and the 7th a scale parameter.

Just to mention that PROJ Rel. 4.8.0, 6 March 2012 expands datum=potsdam 
to ellps=bessel and towgs84=598.1,73.7,418.2,0.202,0.045,-2.455,6.7

IIRC: in earlier PROJ versions, the towgs84 values for datum=potsdam 
were different. In order to be on the safe (and slightly more accurate) 
side, I prefer to use:

+ellps=bessel +nadgrids=path/to/BETA2007.gsb  [1]

Hi all,

I'm working with a large bunch of maps of Indonesia, dating from the 
Dutch colonial period (1850-1946). Quite a few are in the so-called 
"polyhedral" projection, a simple projection that fits the globe locally 
for each separate map sheet. Works fine for a few sheets, but for larger 
surfaces it is impossible to generate a fitting map. Has anyone worked 
with this projection? Is it possible to generate a correct global map 
using proj?

Jan,



No, it is not possible to generate a correct global map using PROJ or any other application using the Polyhedric (Polyeder) projection.  It's an Aphylactic projection; not conformal, not azimuthal, not equal-area/authalic.  It IS easy to cast graphically from simple projection tables, which is why Aphylactics were popular in the 19th century by Topographers using plane tables and alidades in the field.  (Same goes for the Cassini-Soldner and the Polyconic.)

Folks,

We have been using GeoographicLib and it had a convenient function to
calculate distance between two points with an error in the range of nm. I
am familiar with PROJ4 but I don't see any such function in PROJ4. We do
care about accuracy and therefore I am not willing to use simple methods
that consider earth as perfect to compute such distance.

Please let me know if there is such functionality exists in PROJ4.

Thanks

The geod program in proj.4 version 4.8.0 is based on the work of Thomas
(1970).  The accuracy of this method is limited and the inverse method
fails for nearly antipodal points.

In the next(?) version of proj.4, geod will use the geodesic routines
from GeographicLib which cures the defects in Thomas' method.

I hope that this version will also add the geodesic routines in the
proj.4 library so that you can incorporate geodesic calculations into
any code which links against proj.4.

Legal Applications of Geodesic Formulae - Forensic Geodesy
.

I do a great deal of consulting work for Attorneys as an Expert Witness, primarily with respect to Photogrammetry.  On occasion, I am asked to compute distances for submission in pleas for Summary Judgements.



When I use ellipsoidal geodesics (normally the inverse case), I always use whatever is published by the United States National Geodetic Survey.  Irregardless of the accuracy returned (which is quite good for several hundred miles/kilometers); it is what is legally considered as the "National Standard" recognized by our national U.S. government.



Keep that in mind when doing such calculations in your country of residence; supreme accuracy is not as important as legal accuracy.

Hello,

yes, but what a distance?

If you are considering short distances where the most accuracy is usually
required (when building something up to ocean shpis) they do not need
any ellipsoids but straight lines from point to point (and maybe additionally
use lasers to verify them) and if you just give them arcs of accuracy nm you
might be totally in a wrong ball park?

So one needs at least two (or more) distances:

1) Straight line
2) Earth ellipsoidal length which can compensate for different heights above it
3) Some length that does not compensate for any elevations (this might be the
one you have been used to use)
4) A length that follows the earth surface curvatures
5) Maybe some more definitions for some applications

An additional point is that most users do not know their accurate elevation
above any ellipsoid but above the geoid (or some local MSL) so that will
add additional variables to the formula.

So to tell the actual distance between two lat/lons in nm region is not so
simple problem - or the answer is anyway wrong (since the question is
not accurate enough).

Janne.

The "standard" geodesic problem models the earth as an ellipsoid.  As
Janne points out this is only an approximation and many other effects
may enter into the computation of practical distances (geoid separation,
terrain elevation, winds, tides, air corridors, etc.).

Nevertheless, there are applications using using the mathematical model
of the ellipsoid makes sense.  Maritime boundaries are defined in terms
of geodesic distances on a ellipsoid.  Likewise competitive air races
sometimes use the same definition of distances.

Of more relevance to this group, in modeling terrestrial data on a 2-d
surface (e.g., map making!), the ellipsoid is the standard reference
datum.  In this simplified 2-d world the geodesic distance represents
the "true" distance and being able to compute it quickly and accurately
is obviously useful.  A rule of thumb for computations involving
physical data is that you should carry out the internal calculations
with twice as many digits as used to represent the external data.
Asking for full double precision accuracy in such calculations (i.e.,
accuracy to a few nm) is by no means silly.

Clifford,

Can you point me to documentation for this assertion?

I'm guessing that, given the dispersal of judicial responsibilities in
the US (with its federal, state, and local governments), the situation
is less clear cut than you claim.  Probably a lawyer on one side wheels
out an expert witness who will say he's using the NGS algorithm for
ellipsoidal distances.  The opposing lawyer will have contacted his
expert and knows that he's on the losing side of the distance argument
(probably by a lot) and decides not to contest the distance
computation.  Actually, the bigger question (where expert witnesses will
probably also be involved) is whether to use the ellipsoidal geodesic
distance at all (as opposed to map distance or road distance) and what
datum to use.

The outcome would not be very different if the first expert witness used
any other reasonable algorithm for geodesic distances because legal
questions rarely depend on the discriminating distances to an accuracy
of 1/10 mm (the accuracy of the Vincenty algorithms).

(All of this is based on many hours studying the US legal system
through the medium of TV shows.)

Subject: [Proj] Hooijberg's algorithm needed
Message-ID: <CAOk+jYe=n63POxhb9og3ZJ6V6pppbbM3_4TSWKOppp0SbMrXZQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm interested in finding the relationship between scale factors of LCC maps
(aviation) that are designed so they can be put next to each other and
therefore
have a different scale factor each.

The maps cover parts of Europe with standard parallels at 40°N and 52°N. The
scale factor differs slightly and I am interested in a formula to calculate
it.
I have found this in a forum message from 2007:

"Find a chart that gives the true scale at 54ºN and divide that into
500,000.
This is the scale factor. For 51N the scale factor is 500/515=0.9709, =
1/1.03
Running Hooijberg's algorith for LCC, 2 parallels, the scale factor at
54N=0.97005."

Unfortunately a search for Hooijberg's algorithm was not successful. Any
pointers appreciated!

Thanks!
Achim

In Snyder's book, "Map Projections: A Working Manual", the symbol k stands for the local scale factor, and you can find formulas for k for an ellipsoid-based LCC projection at the top of page 108.

http://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395

It may be possible to compute k with Proj.4, but I don't know how to do that.

Can anyone tell me how the references at spatialreference.org are 
related to the proj-strings of the official proj library? Nowadays proj 
includes lots of WGS-84 shifts, and at least one of them (28992, Dutch 
RD) is not propagated to spatialreference.org.

The relationship to spatialreference.org is one of being simply out-of-date. sr.org has not been updated in quite a while, and it needs a champion to come along and bring things forward.  sr.org gets its definitions from proj.4/GDAL as well as GeoTools. These have not been refreshed in at least a couple of years -- time for more than one EPSG database drop and the inclusion of datum shifting description in proj.4.

Hope this helps,

Howard
