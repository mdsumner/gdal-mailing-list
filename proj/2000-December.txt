Subject: [OSRS-PROJ] Building windows proj.dll
Message-ID: <002701c05ba9$cf4a7d60$1e01a8c0@andrew>

Hi,

I wonder if anyone could offer some assistance:

I'm trying to build the proj.4 library under Windows using the supplied makefile.vc as per the readme file. Unfortunately the file
proj.def does not seem to be present in the source distribution and this file is needed in order to build the file proj.dll.

FYI I'm using
M$ Windows NT 4 SP6
M$ Visual Studio 6.0

Proj.4 source distribution from ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/proj/proj-4.4.2.tar.gz

TIA

Andrew,

Sorry about that, it was omitted from the distribution files by accident. 

I have attached proj.def to this message, and updated the makefiles so it
will be automatically included in the next release. 

Note that the current windows makefile doesn't build geod.exe (I added this
recently in CVS) and doesn't do any of the datum shifting stuff.  If these are
issues for you let me know, and I will try to rectify the matter.

Best regards,

Thanks, you're a star! It worked a treat!

Incidentally, I tried a search on the mailing list archive for "windows"...it pulled out every single message of yours because of
your sig ;-)

Thanks again,
