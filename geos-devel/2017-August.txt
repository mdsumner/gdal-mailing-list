 The presence of std::isnan() is not properly detected on Solaris 11.3 in
 platform.h.in


 The attached patch fixes it. It has been tested on Solaris 11.3 with GCC
 5.4.0 on SPARC and x86.


 Solaris and GCC full versions are

Subject: [geos-devel] Generic algorithms (idea)
Message-ID: <CAL_D68kBCQF-9n8SQFzYH5Euawb3n_xkfDzX5A7kDU26zdDQGg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,
I had this idea and I think you may be interested in it, so I decided to
sign up in the mailing discussion and send this mail.

The idea is to make a collection of generalized functions for geometry (and
possibly cartography) algorithms; trying to detach the algorithms from the
data structure.
I know it can be hard to imagine so I did this very trivial example:

inline constexpr auto supernaive_add_points(auto&& pointA, auto&& pointB) {
    return pointA + pointB;
}

This is probably the most naive approach. This will require the points to
have the operator+ overloaded. In this theoretical case, whoever did the
operator+ would had actually done all the work. So an actual addition could
look something like this:

template<typename Point>
inline constexpr Point naive_add_points(auto&& pointA, auto&& pointB) {
    // Both points actually need the x() and y() getter; otherwise an error
will be thrown by the compiler (this are parts of the requirements to
execute this function).
    // The x and y types are deduced automatically so they may be a float,
an integer or even a custom type with overridden operator+. x and y may
actually have different types.
    auto x = pointA.x() + pointB.x();
    auto y = pointA.y() + pointB.y();

    // We make the object resulting of the addition and return it. If there
isn't an exact mach C++ will try to find an alternative.
    return Point(x, y);
}

This function requires both points to have the getters `x()` and `y()`, and
Point to have a constructor compatible with the returned types. This is a
little bit more mature but still very naive since the return type is a
template argument. In reality, you would try to deduce its return type with
some template tricks.

It would be possible to use any data structure as long as your class has
the functions requirements. It would NOT use an interface (or in C++ terms,
a pure virtual class) to get the functions; this would allow the developers
to use any class that already met the requirements.

So let me list all the pros, cons and things to keep in mind that I can
came up with about this approach:

Pros:
 - 0 overhead approach.
 - Very portable between projects.
 - Separates algorithm from data structure.
 - If you don't use an algorithm, it won't exist in your binary (because it
uses templates and/or auto, it is not fully defined until it's called).
 - Can have multiple implementations simultaneously and let the developer
choose the best one for their needs.
 - Everyone can add a new algorithm or implementation.
 - Adding a new algorithm or implementation will not break all the existing
code nor any project using it.
 - It would be really easy to add a new algorithm or implementation, and it
wouldn't break any code.
 - Requires modern C++.

Cons:
 - Required modern C++.
 - Need to rewrite code.
 - It cannot be exported to a dynamic library by itself: you'll need a data
structure and a C binding.
 - Developers must know the difference between implementations.
 - Documentation has to be really clear to prevent misunderstandings,
specially each implementation's requirements.
 - May need to rewrite an implementation changing just a little part.

To keep in mind:
 - Requiring modern C++ have its own pros and cons. With C++11 would be
enough but later versions can have more features.
 - You need to be consistent with the requirements (to be as useful as
possible).
 - You can use perfect forwarding in the C bound functions to call your
functions (to make a dynamic library).
 - Having a "main" function that defaults to an implementation could help
the developers to choose one.
 - Anyone can copy an algorithm implementation without the need to make
changes, without adding the entire project as dependency.

Thank you for reading,
Martí Angelats i Ribera

PS: This mail ended up being a longer mail than I initially expected. Sorry
for that.

You might be interested in boost::geometry and CGAL, both providing
such generalized functions.

Comment (by robe):

 This ticket is so old I'm not even sure if it's an issue anymore and don't
 know how to test it.

 strk we keep on pushing this, you think we should just change to a won't
 fix or verify it is even still an issue?

 Hi all,

 Using Postgis's ST_PointOnSurface, i've got some weird results in recent
 version of Postgis (> 2.0).

 See that image :
 [[Image(https://imagebin.ca/v/3YWtCXtT5lHs)]]


 I would like to know how the PointOnSurface is calculated, and why there
 are so much differences between polygon A,B and C.

 With Postgis 1.5 it was working fine (i.e. the PointOnSurface for my
 polygons were at almost the same place than the Centroids)

 Thank you.

 Sylvain b.

Message-ID: <CABUeae_3TmGijQ988=YPKXDUhZOo7pcXR3J21m6ZzEZFhwr74A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Since .editorconfig now forces LF/CRLF per file type in the codebase,
wouldn't it be a good idea to add .gitattributes with explicit
eol= specification per file type too?

This would ensure git checkout/commit does not re-convert line endings
differently than as expected by .editorconfig.

Best regards,

I'm fine with that.

+1

I think as long as we don't have SVN in mix anymore that should behave right.

Comment (by mloskot):

 FWIW, `ST_PointOnSurface` returns **an arbitrary point**. The only
 guarantee is that such point is located inside interior of a geometry.
 Subsequent calls of `ST_PointOnSurface` for the same geometry might
 possibly return different points (all inside the interior, of course).

I still hadn't fully understood .gitattributes but I think with
PostgGIS it was the culprit for the conversion (ie: getting rid of
.gitattributes stopped performing conversions).

On the contrary, .editorconfig only affects *editors*.

Are you seeing automatic conversions on checkout/commit under GEOS ?

Please don't configure eol in .gitattributes, this causing problems for
packagers who use git. The eol option changes the source files to no
longer match what's in the source tarballs causing the buildsystem to
refuse to build the package due to changes to the upstream source.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Message-ID: <002d01d3224f$2b310530$81930f90$@pcorp.us>

I'm planning to do a GEOS 3.7.0 release in 2 weeks time so that PostGIS
2.4.0 users can comfortably compile against GEOS 3.7.0 and have the new
functionality that relies on it exposed.
I've already discussed with Sandro and he was okay with that if I'm willing
to do the work to make it happen.

Let me know if anyone has issue with that or if they really want an RC
first.

I've still got a couple more tickets to push to GEOS 3.8 milestone.

Thanks,
Regina Obe

From the packaging viewpoint, I'd like an RC (which preferably unpacks
to the same pathname as the file, so that one can just change the
version in the packaging file and build it, but of course I can hack
around non-standard behavior).  I suspect other people that package can
pre-stage an update and try it, running tests, etc., and this may smoke
out some issues.

(I haven't been paying attention, but I had no idea a 3.7 was imminent.
Just a random comment; there's no reason me being surprised matters.)

Yah it's a little rushed because we have a function in PostGIS 2.4.0 that
relies on GEOS 3.7 -- this one

https://postgis.net/docs/manual-dev/ST_FrechetDistance.html

and though you can compile PostGIS 2.4.0 with 3.4 or higher, I did have to
put in a warning something to the effect:

"If you are compiling with GEOS < 3.7you are not getting the full PostGIS
functionality."


It seems almost silly to say that if GEOS 3.7.0 is not out yet.

Okay I'll release an RC before final.  Not sure how much I can fuss with
internal packaging since I'm planning to just use the make dist which I
think will end up putting it out as -RC.

Thanks,
Regina
