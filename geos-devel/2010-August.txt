Subject: [geos-devel] EWKB and M component
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=WRopGLYggocNQJsMQ+_6fp-pF=egUrBz10qa6@mail.gmail.com>

We have recently ran across some data that we are trying to load from
PostGIS that contains a fourth M component. [1] We quickly noticed
that the GEOS WKBReader does not support a potential M component. Are
there any plans to improve support for this extra component?

Since we really don't care about this fourth component, and we didn't
want to attempt to add a fourth component to the Coordinate class, we
extended the WKBReader to simply strip this extra component. I have
attached a patch for review.

Thanks,
Aron

 A commit of code modification made by Safe Software:

 When buffering, we previously filtered out points that were some distance
 away from the original geometry. This value was set as 98% of the
 buffering distance. The problem with that was, at large distances,
 artifacts arise because they don't get filtered as they should.

 We've made a code change here to improve the filtering of artifacts when
 doing a single sided buffer, especially for larger values. The patch is
 attached and like before, we want to allow some time for feedback before
 committing.

 Hello,

 I reported this on the postGIS list, but realize now that the error is
 with this underlying component. I thought I might get some advice here. I
 have a postGIS polygon layer with about 320,000 rows. I am trying to
 return a table with ogc_fid and the average area of the surrounding
 (touching) polygons. I am getting this error:


 NOTICE:  TopologyException: side location conflict 1.34593e+07 289017
 ERROR:  GEOS touches() threw an error!

 ********** Error **********

 ERROR: GEOS touches() threw an error!
 SQL state: XX000


 I have tried to simplify the geometry many different times. Nothing
 seems to solve the problem. I can process the first 20,000 rows
 (object_number < 20000) but something is causing problems after that. I
 have pasted the script below, any suggestions would be welcomed! I *may*
 be able to post some of the data, but I will need to get permission from
 the owner.

 Thank you,
 -david


 SELECT p1.ogc_fid, avg(p2.shape_area)
 FROM parcels09_d3_v2_simplify as p1, parcels09_d3_v2_simplify as p2

	failed
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=_nHd7nihwpqNrzr6hkwSxgHkk4Ac0J3_+G22r@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I ran into this assertion failure while developing a python script
that uses Shapely 1.2.3 with GEOS 3.2.2.  My program makes it most of
the way through a large dataset and then gives this message:

python: PolygonBuilder.cpp:261: geos::geomgraph::EdgeRing*
geos::operation::overlay::PolygonBuilder::findShell(std::vector<geos::operation::overlay::MinimalEdgeRing*,
std::allocator<geos::operation::overlay::MinimalEdgeRing*> >*):
Assertion `shellCount <= 1' failed.

I figured I'd try to isolate some code that can recreate the problem,
and see if I can get the same behavior with some test code in C, but
first I just wanted to ask what this failure is all about.  And what
is a minimal edge ring?  Any pointers that could help me understand
how to debug the problem would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Kyle Cronan

Comment(by strk):

 The attached bug358.xml file is for use within GEOS environment.
 You need to build GEOS with GEOS_DEBUG_BINARYOP defined in
 include/geos/geom/BinaryOp.h
 to see the problem.

 For some reason XMLTester --test-valid-output doesn't catch the
 invalidity, which should be researched on too...

Hey All,

I'm trying to get geos running on Centos 5.5, and can't get it to compile.

Comment(by strk):

 Alright, the reson why XMLTester --test-valid-output doesn't catch the
 invalidity
 is because it tests validity of the expected output, not the obtained
 output.

 Anyway, the problem here is the fact that a valid geometry, when passing
 trough
 the "common bits adder" procedure becomes invalid.

 The invalidity is a collapsed polygon ring (7th inner ring of obtained
 result).

  POLYGON((1659284.6921065 4797450.16609695,
           1659297.0472 4797444.3747,
           1659284.6921065 4797450.16609695,
           1659284.6921065 4797450.16609695))

 The same ring was NOT invalid when computed, which was, with
 removed bits 1659284 4797450:

  POLYGON((4500.69210649658 5130.16609695368,
           4500.69210649654 5130.16609695368,
           4513.04719999991 5124.37470000051,
           4500.69210649658 5130.16609695368))

 ... thus became invalid when summing up bits and discarding
 the high precision ones.

 Sounds like a conceptually possible thing to happen when
 removing and then re-adding precision bits.

Comment(by strk):

 So, confirmed as possible and found out JTS is indeed checking for this
 condition
 before passing the result back.
 Taking the same approach in GEOS (BinaryOp) will automatically fallback to
 next
 heuristic function (SnapOp) and succeed for this specific case.

 I'd commit such change (so we are closer to JTS). Only problem I have is
 case5 in robustness.xml which would then fail (rather than giving invalid
 result, that is...).
 Not a huge deal, but might raise the question of wheter or not invalid
 results should be accepted to give the user a chance to clean them up
 later...

I suggest you strip the M on the db side.
GEOS's WKBReader is meant to read WKB, not EWKB.

 Intersection:

You must have removed it unintentionally.
Try a make clean and make again (from top-level dir).
Or, if you feel brave, just rm src/libgeos.{la,lo} and make.

Subject: [geos-devel] Invalid geometries from GEOS operations
Message-ID: <20100827142143.GL4155@keybit.net>

I've spent some days enhancing the XMLTester to check
for validity of returned geometries and found a dozen
or more such cases (6 couple of inputs, multi-ops for
some of them).

All the invalidities come out from GEOS unchecked use of
CommonBitsOp, whereas such operation is known to possibly
yeld collapsed poligons due to loss of precision when 
translating back (re-adding the previously stripped bits).

In JTS, an EnhancedBitsOp class is used to basically add
a validity check around the CommonBitsOp to ensure the
result would be checked before returning.
In GEOS, doing a similar thing would be nice as we could
then try something else (SnapOp). Well, I did and that
fixed 5 over 6 tests. Unfortunately the last test broke
completely, that is it would not return an invalid geometry 
(as it did before) but rather an exception.

OUT OF DETAIL, INTO THE POINT

Ok, simple question for you now is:
Should GEOS always throw an exception in preference over
returning an invalid geometry ?

Oh, forgot to mention: in trunk you can choose whether
or not to enable the check for validity thus giving
SnapOp a chance to give you valid result or exception.

Default is don't check (like it's always been), you can change
by defining GEOS_CHECK_COMMONBITS_VALIDITY in
include/geos/geom/BinaryOp.h (around line 120)

Note that defining that macro would make GEOS closer
to JTS in functionality.

Comment(by strk):

 For the record, there were other 5 tests, beside the one in
 robustness.xml, returning invalid geometries in output.

 Current trunk have these isolated in their own files (robustness-invalid-
 output.xml and stml-something-invalid-output.xml).

 With the fallback patch all the tests in stml*xml still succeed and give
 valid results,
 while the one in robustness-invalid-output.xml fails with an exception.
 See bug 375 for that one.

Comment(by strk):

 For the record: refusing an invalid result from the CommonBitsOp policy
 thus passing the ball to SnapOp fixes all the stmlf* cases but still
 triggers an exception on this one.

 At closer look, the SnapOp for this one fails because snapping one of the
 geometries makes it invalid (self-intersection).
 Computed snap tolerance is 1.1831999999e-07
 The two geometries are almost identical, snapping makes a spike collapse
 to a line.

 Of course I'm talking about the result when refusing the invalid result
 from COmmonBitsOp.. which gets closer to becoming the default IMHO

Greetings all,

When I use GEOS on Linux I need both the libgeos.so and libgeos_c.so to compile/run but on Windows it seems like only geos_c.dll was built, no geos.dll to be found. Is this an artifact of how I built GEOS? Do I ever need both geos.dll and geos_c.dll on Windows? Any info is greatly appreciated. Thanks!

geos_c.dll _might_ already contain geos.dll.
On Linux geos_c lib usually links (doesn't contain) geos lib.

Thanks strk, I suspected something like that. I need to redistribute the
DLL so I need to make sure that it has everything needed to run an app
using the GEOS CAPI.
