Hallo again,

I know that usually it is not really helpful to submit a request twice but in 
this case I give it a try by formulating the request slightly different: Can 
anybody please try just to through the below mentioned polygons into the 
corresponding geos function and confirm the behavior? All I want to know is, 
whether this is really a bug or whether I just oversee something. 

(If I get no answer to this email I will just add this example to the bug 
tracker.)

Thanks,

	Silke

Hello,

Not too much help, I know, but things do look amiss! The following WKB
also fails with buffer(-2). It is almost identical to the second WKB
in your post (and which produces a valid buffer), differing only at
around the 15th decimal place (didn't check exactly!):

Message-ID: <47AA01C2.4080508@pobox.com>

Folks,

The SVN snaphots pointed to by the web site are not being updated.  Last one
was from December.

I have filed a ticket at:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/174

I would be prepared to setup snapshot generation on download.osgeo.org (as
we do for GDAL, MapServer, etc) using a cron job if Paul isn't too keen to
fix this up on his server.  I'd also be interested in cloning the geos
releases on download.osgeo.org if no one has an objection.

---

Are we thinking of a GEOS 3.0.1 release?  If so, I'll fix up the win32
makefile.vc builds in the 3.0 branch.  I had to hack them together for
OSGeo4W and the updated tar file of source with modified makefiles is at:

   http://download.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/release/geos/geos-3.0.0-1.tar.bz2

Best regards,

I don't mind either way. If you set up on downloads, could you do the  
following:

- snapshots
- SVN.txt
- doxygen

The current script is at http://geos.refractions.net/geos-auto.sh

When those are all on downloads, the web content can be moved to  
osgeo.org as well and I can redirect geos.refractions.net

Folks,

I have taken the liberty of closing the 3.0.0 milestone and pushing the
open tickets to the 3.0.1 milestone:

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=3.0.1

I have fixed up the nmake related packaging issues.  I've also fixed up trunk
so packaged distributions work (I hate having to list every file in the
Makefile.am's!).

I have prepared a quickly 3.0.1 alpha for folks to test.  I'll leave a more
official RC to Paul.

Thanks, Homme, for this analysis. The result means to me that there is indeed 
a bug in the buffer function. Thus I will create a ticket in the bug tracker.

Perhaps I will have time to dig a bit deeper into the code to find out why the 
buffer function behaves like that. I will keep you informed and of course I 
appreciate any more comments about this issue.

Greetings,

	Silke

Message-ID: <47B4CC07.9060602@alumni.uwaterloo.ca>

Hello List,

I'm setting up a new server that in the not-too-distant future will be 
used for some live project work.  I'm currently running Fedora 8, and I 
find that most of the GIS-related utilities we need are available from 
the default Fedora repositories.  However, the Geos in the Fedora 
repositories is still at version 2.2.3.  I don't know how likely that is 
to change in the near future, but I'm guessing it might be a while (if 
at all for Fedora 8) given the number of dependencies that would also 
have to be updated (Gdal, Qgis, MapServer, etc.).

What I'd like to know is whether the improvements in 3.0.0 are 
significant enough to make it worthwhile for me to go through the 
process of compiling it myself (plus all of the dependant tools).  This 
isn't too difficult for me to do, but it is time consuming, and I'd 
rather rely on binaries complied and tested by those with more expertise 
than I have.  Alternatively, I can stick with 2.2.3 (and maybe hope for 
updates on F8), or consider another distribution that has Geos 3.0.0 
already distributed with it (does anyone know if this is the case, maybe 
for CentOS?).

What recommendations would anyone on this list have?

Thanks in advance,
Mike

Mike,

If Fedora 8 doesn't have it, then I'm pretty sure CentOS won't either,  
as it's repackaged from Red Hat, which is in turn behind Fedora Core  
in terms of available packages.  In fact, I have access to a CentOS  
server and can't find *any* version of GEOS via default yum listing.   
I had to compile GEOS 3 everywhere.

Mike,

The significance of the changes is all in your perception and use. If  
you happen to hit a geometry bug in 2.2, then 3.0 becomes much more  
significant to you.

I'd suggest "going with the flow". Use what you have as default until  
such a time as it doesn't do what you want or need.

Paul

Paul,

Thanks for the response.  Going with the flow is certainly preferable, 
but I'd rather avoid bugs down the road if I can.  After looking at the 
bug tracker, it looks like there are quite a few major/critical bugs 
that were fixed in 3.0.  Is it only those bugs with 2.2.x specified as 
the version that I should look at?  Sorry if that's an obvious question 
- I just want to make a semi-educated decision about what problems I 
might encounter if I stick with 2.2.3.

Regards,
Mike

Hi,

I have tried to recompile Geos 2.2.3 in VC2005.
Compiling from within IDE or using VS command prompt works OK, TestSweepLineSpeed.exe is executed well but when I check Geos dlls in Dependency Walker I get errors with locating MSVCP80.DLL and MSVCR80.DLL. I think these dlls are related to manifest files and .Net but I'm unable to exclude the from build.

Any help?

Thanks

Yeah - a lot of the python examples are out of date since they were 
originally done when the bindings worked against the C++ api and not the 
  c api.

  It appears to me that a bunch of stuff is missing from the

Hmm, looks like for some reason I never exposed the createCollection 
method to Python/Ruby (see around line 947 in geos.i).   I could add it 
easily enough if you need it.

Charlie,

That would be good if you would do that.  I've never used swig before.  
I probably should learn it.  It looks quite useful.

Hi there,

While you're looking at this, Charlie, a lot of the tests in the swig/ 
ruby/test/ directory don't work either, especially those using  
Geos::GeometryFactory plus others.

How to add a Point to LIneString? I know there is some functions named
AddPoint in the OGR Library. But when i want to edit the LineString object
to add a Point, I have no idea with that. I try to find the method in the
source of geos and the JTS documents, but nothing I got.

Please tell me how to add a Point to LineString.
Thanks very much.

Best regards to everyone.
