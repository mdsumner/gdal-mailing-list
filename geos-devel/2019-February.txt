You asked, on IRC:

My word: go for it, astyle in repo !

BTW, about f43aa53d27b3889823365317fcf4ff45e60dc90f, why was the 120
columns wrap decided ? What's 120 ?

Greetings, all.

Most of you know me, but for anyone that doesn't I'm Martin Davis (AKA Dr
JTS).  I'm the project lead for the JTS Topology Suite [1], and am a
long-time lurker on the fringes of GEOS.

I've recently joined Paul Ramsey at Crunchy Data, [2] and we're excited
about being able to bring more resources to bear on advancing the state of
the JTS/GEOS/PostGIS ecosystem.

I'll be ramping up gradually in the GEOS world, so feel free to offer
helpful advice!

Look forward to working with you all - Martin

Great news Martin, really exciting !
Advice: start learning to parse these<things> :)

My hope for a fully robust snap-rounding implementation raises, as
well as new APIs to expose topology-building to the outside world
(thinking PostGIS Topology for both points)

Will be good to work with you more cloaely, Sandro.

Overlay robustness is definitely on the ToDo list.  And I look forward to
learning more about PostGIS Topology and helping out with it.

Comment (by mdavis):

 The reason for the discrepancy in computed interior points is due to how
 the Interior Point in Area algorithm works.  It is designed to quickly
 find a point lying in the polygon interior, and is optimized for
 performance, not quality of point location.  The two polygons just happen
 to be different enough that the algorithm chooses a different "band" of
 the polygon to place the interior point.

 If a better quality location is desired, then there are other (less
 performant) algorithms to do this (e.g. computing the
 LargestInscribedCircle AKA Pole of Inaccessibility).  I'm hoping to bring
 this to GEOS soon.  Or perhaps compute both the centroid and interior
 point and pick the best one (= furthest from polygon boundary AND in the
 interior)

 @mloskot: the InteriorPointArea algorithm is deterministic, so it does
 actually return the same point each time it is called.

 Finally, there's a big performance improvement available for the
 InteriorPointArea algorithm, and that should land soon in GEOS.

Subject: [geos-devel] opBuffer.h et al
Message-ID: <CACowWR005BFr9SeW575DCFaOAVHSK_LAgL5rtTceNJpqoZ09bQ@mail.gmail.com>

Question for the Old Ones:

In include/geos there's a bunch of what look like "utility headers",
for example https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/master/include/geos/opBuffer.h

They don't seem to get much/any use in the GEOS code base itself. Does
anyone know why they were added and to help whom? I can see that in
theory they might define a "public C++ API" but in practice they are
probably code rotten right now.

Info much appreciated!

They were added to reduce includes in C++ tester script
(example.cpp?). Feel free to drop them as long as the test
script still compiles, and let C++ users scream (they should
be using the C-API anyway...)

 Yes, it's just a check for trailing spaces. Probably only incorporated

 Right... and I'm not using autotools buildchain (yet).  And there is
 indeed some trailing spaces.

Martin, can you please take a look at why gitlab CI fails ?
I'm not sure it has to do with any of your recent commits.
It would be great if gitlab-ci could be configured to notify the
mailing list instead of just me ...

May I suggest to include the short commit hash on the same line as "Last port" ?
It would help using with grep. Syntax could be something like:

 * Last port: algorithm/InteriorPointArea.java a140ca30 (JTS-1.17+)

Having full url to the official repository is also good

Right, I can see why that would be useful.  I was worried that using a
short hashlet might not be unique [1].  But can easily do both I guess.  Or
maybe just a concern for future generations.

I’ve been putting dates YYYY-MM-DD into the headers on the ones I’ve been doing. Avoids system dependence and version numbering.

Date is also nice, and that human-readable version
The more refs we have, the better :)

But the very detailed revision (svn revision, or git hash)
helps in spotting _exact_ difference.

 rttopo / liblwgeom has MakeValid() and BuildArea() functions that would be
 convenient to have in GEOS itself for projects that can't use
 rttopo/liblwgeom. @strk agreed in
 https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos/pulls/27 that the relevant rttopo
 code was fine to relicense to LGPL for inclusion in GEOS and I did a first
 take at doing the exercice, but using the GEOS C API. I'll take a new try
 at porting this code to using GEOS C++ API instead

So we understand, what is the use case here?  Are you grepping to find all
GEOS files which were changed from a given JTS commit?

If so, do you want any extra tag for the hashlet?   Give us an example of
the standard form...

The most recent pipeline passes:

https://gitlab.com/geos/libgeos/pipelines/48455803

The previous pipeline failed because of a missing std:: declaration.  That
caused several of the bots to fail, so it was pretty visibl.

https://gitlab.com/geos/libgeos/pipelines/48453688

So seems like this isn't a problem?

Use case is: to get a feel of which files were ported when, I grep
for 'Last Port' in all files.

Works better with SVN revisions and dates and human readable versions
than with hashes indeed, so feel free to leave the hash where it is :)

Is the JTS commit URL even useful then?

Paul says he puts it into the GEOS commit msg, which seems potentially
useful. Although there may be multiple commits to get a port completed
(ahem - mea culpa).  But there's probably a big initial commit which will
be obvious.

I'm tempted to say let's do it all - but might be tedious:

Last port: algorithm/InteriorPointArea.java (JTS-1.17 - 2019/02/19 -
a140ca30cc5 )

 appveyor.yml currently tests 8 configurations, each one of them taking
 more than 10 minutes, and not being parallelized. Which makes the
 turnaround for a pull request super slow

 I'll propose a PR to reduce this to 2 configurations:
 - "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"
 - Visual Studio 2015, "NMake Makefiles", x86

 That way we test the 2 architectures, the 2 compilers, and the 2 makefile
 generators. Other combinations are mostly taking CMake generation
 itself...

Comment (by dbaston):

 We've had lots of build errors that were specific to particular MSVC
 versions and architectures, so I'd be hesitant to remove these in the name
 of efficiency. (One can always reduce the "turnaround" by deciding to
 ignore some of the configurations.)

 We could remove the NMake configuration though, as I believe we've agreed
 not to support that.

Comment (by rouault):

 My reduced set conserves all the individual possibilities (2015 vs 2017,
 x86 vs x64, nmake makefiles vs visual studio projects), but in just 2
 configurations instead of 8. I believe this should offer a decent enough
 coverage . Basically that's what I do for GDAL :

#955: Reducing number of configurations in appveyor.yml

Comment (by dbaston):

 I would have said that going to 4 configurations seems reasonable, but it
 looks like Paul went ahead and merged the drop to just two. Maybe we'll
 hear about failures like
 ​https://ci.appveyor.com/project/dbaston/geos/builds/22032835 from users
 of the untested platforms, if there are any.

Hi Martin,

You're welcome to link the badge to my AppVeyor account if you'd like. I
just set that up because I wanted to test my own pull requests against
MSVC, and the OSGeo/geos AppVeyor stopped working when the GEOS repository
was moved out of the OSGeo organization. Probably a better solution is for
someone to figure out how to either revive the OSGeo/geos AppVeyor, or to
create a new project-specific AppVeyor account.

Agreed, someone should make the GEOS Appveyor setup better.  I'd just like
to get the badge working, so failures are more visible.

Can you provide a URL for the badge?

Comment (by mdavis):

 I don't see the warning because I'm using clang (OSX).  So wondering how
 to check for these warnings.  Does it show up on one of the buildbots?

 This is going to be painful going forward unless we can get this check
 happening in all buildchains.

 Ah, I saw this locally with gcc 5.4 of Ubuntu 16.04, but it also showed up
 on Travis-CI. For example: https://travis-
 ci.com/libgeos/geos/jobs/179892298

 We should probably harden bots to enable -Werror

 Yes, no point in issuing warnings which won't be noticed.

 But that won't fix my buildchain.  So probably need to add those flags to
 clang as well?

Comment (by rouault):

 Unfortunately (or fortunately !) gcc has warnings that clang doesn't have,
 and the reverse. Or sometimes they have the same flags, like -Wshadow, but
 they don't behave exactly the same, and that also depends on the version
 of the compilers... That's the point of having CI testing both...

Comment (by mdavis):

 In that case I think we should remove the warnings which can't be
 reproduced in all development environments.  Otherwise we're going to keep
 running into this kind of situation.  And I don't think you want to keep
 having to create patches for my code..  :)

 Doesn't Even's suggestion to enable -Werror in our CI solve the

 Not sure.  If the OSX clang build doesn't have -Wshadow then would -Werror
 actually raise an error?

 You wouldn't get an error locally, but you'd see it when Travis builds
 against gcc (https://travis-ci.com/libgeos/geos/jobs/179892298#L708) and
 could address it before merging.

 That's the whole point of the github/gitlab/etc + continuous integration
 workflows... A lot of project work like that. For example, I had to fix
 the Windows build because there was an earlier commit made in master which
 broke it.

 Are we guaranteed that shadowing behaves in the same exact way

 Of course not. As mentionned above, even C++ compilers do not all agree on
 what is shadowing and what is not. You fix until they are all happy...

 But CI is still good, as long as it cannot represent

 I suppose you don't merge pull requests for which a bot is red, do you ? I
 don't on the projects I'm responsible for...

Comment (by mdavis):

 I would say policy is not to merge if a bot is red.  If the bot is wrong
 then it needs to be fixed.

 Although if a bot is badly broken (like Bessies are now) then might have
 to ignore them and carry on.

Comment (by strk):

 I would say the policy is to look after bots and see if
 they cought a bug introduced by something you commit.

 In other words:
  1) commit
  2) check if bots are happy

 This is different from:
  1) wait on bots semaphores
  2) merge if they are happy

 The reason why I like the first better is that
 we are still in control. Machines can be sooo rude.

 In recent projects I work on Travis drives me nuts,
 it is often unstable for any number of reasons and
 being unable to merge is wildly frustrating.

Comment (by dbaston):

 You can run CI on your code in a branch before committing it to master and
 still be in control. If you decide the failure is because of a problem
 with the CI, and you aren't able to fix the CI, you can decide to merge it
 anyway.

 "Commit first, fix later" can introduce a lot of frustration when multiple
 developers are trying to work at the same time. GEOS is not an especially
 high-traffic project, but there have certainly been times I've stopped
 work because the master branch had build failures.

 I agree with Dan - best to check bots before committing.

 AFAIK the only way to do this in GEOS is via a PR on GitHub - is that
 right?   But that doesn't cover all build platforms, so is not foolproof.

Comment (by dbaston):

 A GitHub PR gets you testing against Linux (10 build chains) and Windows
 (2 build chains). I don't think the FreeBSD bots pick up pull requests.
 And we don't have any testing for OS X (though Travis supports it).

Comment (by mdavis):

 Ok, that sounds good enough to catch most coding errors.  And now that the
 badges are fixed the GH CI will be a bit more visible.

 So I guess the best practice is to always make a GH PR for any non-trivial
 change.  Would be good to document this.

 This still only really helps if Werror is in place, right?

 Yes, we still need `-Werror` unless we want to read all of the build logs
 (I certainly don't!)

Comment (by strk):

 The only way to test _TRAVIS_ is via PRs on GitHub.
 But you can test other bots in other ways.

 Drone can be tested locally with:

   drone exec

 (requires installing drone)

 A PR on the OSGeo GIT infrastructure will automatically
 trigger a Drone build and report status in the commit
 tab (green/yellow/red tiny dot).

 Debbie and Winnie builds I think are only triggered
 by commits to the "master" branch.

 Generally speaking, I think developers are humans so
 don't need bots and should just run:

   make check

 which should run all tests in case of GEOS

 NOTE that every environment may have its own peculiarities
 and thus fail in different way. This means a bot can be
 happy while a Real Human Developer may be blocked by a build
 failure in his/her specific environment (our bots cover
 only a subset of operating systems/architectures).

Comment (by strk):

 I would not like to be _recommended_ to use a proprietary
 service, so please don't force me, as a developer, to file
 pull requests on GitHub.

 I'm happy with pushing PRs against the official Git hosting
 service (OSGeo infrastructure).

 The Jenkins service run by Regina if I'm not mistaken does
 support building code from Gitea pull requests, only nobody
 found the time yet to set it up. Does anyone want to help
 Regina with that ?

 It would also give us FreeBSD testing.

Comment (by mdavis):

 I agree with strk that the ideal is that a dev just has to check their
 local build to see if all is good.  But that's what I've been doing and
 it's not been a great experience so far.

 One issue is that the autotools build is different to the cmake build
 (e.g. check for trailing spaces)
 Another is the one on this ticket - -Wshadow is not in place for OSX
 build.

 So I have to check the bots as well.

 (The REAL ideal would be one build chain and one repo - but that's been
 discussed elsewhere.)

Comment (by mdavis):

 FWIW, I experimented with add AppleClang to the cmake GCC path (which is
 pretty crazy in itself [1]).  Had to remove -fno-implicit-inline-
 templates.  Then still got a ton of new warnings, mostly about implicit
 conversions.

 So it doesn't seem like there's a simple path to making the OSX build
 chain match the GCC one.

Message-ID: <CAK2ens2d9Eftur2tbH96TG2Zfnijx8Ass-obeCLJsNX8FL-a7Q@mail.gmail.com>

Just in case anyone isn't familiar with it, the JTS TestBuilder is a Java
GUI application which might be useful for some aspects of GEOS
development.  In particular, it's handy for creating and viewing geometry
test cases.  You can draw and edit geometry, and capture the results as WKT
or WKB (and several other formats as well).  You can also drop an entire
JTS/GEOS Test XML file in order to view all the cases in the file.

It's available as a fat jar from the JTS Releases page:

https://github.com/locationtech/jts/releases

Docs are limited, but most things have tooltips.  With suitable
encouragement I might even get around to writing a proper manual one day...

Martin,

thanks for the hint. Let me mention alternatives :-)

For those who prefer QGIS, I suggest the QuickWKT plugin where you can paste 
WKT or WKB.
If you select a feature (existing, or just created), copy and paste it in a 
text application, you will get the WKT.

Otherwise (limited to WKT), you may also create a simple .csv file

id,WKT
1,"your WKT"
2,"your WKT"

and open it with QGIS. (the WKT colum name is critical so that the column is 
recognized as a geometry)
