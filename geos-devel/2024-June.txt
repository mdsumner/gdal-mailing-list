Thanks for weighing in on this. I've gone ahead and uploaded 3.12.1 to
Zenodo. The concept DOI is https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11396894

If anyone would like to see changes on the entry itself, just let me know.

Thanks,
Dan

Uploading a release generates a digital object identifier (DOI) that can be used to cite a specific release of GEOS, as well as a "concept" DOI that can be used to cite GEOS in general. At least in the US government, having a persistent identifier for software citation is becoming a requirement for funding.

Dan,

Any thoughts on what Even said, to install Zenodo integration on the libgeos/geos github project?

https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2024-May/011015.html

Maybe you did already, didn't check.

I assume if we are going to do this and we are on github anyway, we might as well automate the process.

Thanks,
Regina

> Zenodo integration on the libgeos/geos github project?

I looked into this for another project and hesitated about giving
Zenodo access to my GitHub account. There's also a GitHub Action for
this, but my experience is that actions triggered by releases are hard
to maintain unless you're releasing very frequently.

I think our releases are infrequent enough that I can manually upload
them if we want to. From my end, the value is more in the "concept"
DOI than in opening another distribution channel and having individual
releases be citable.

I see that both 3.11 and 3.12 have accrued about a dozen fixes of some utility, and are both over 6 months from last release, so I propose doing a maintenance release off those branches.

Any objections, please raise them, otherwise I will do this tomorrow.

Thanks,

code generated by "AI" is basically a copyright violation, and thus may
not be added to the project.   I think that's pretty obvious and not
really open to debate, but of course others may differ.

Message-ID: <2BD37F3D-9A66-458E-BEFE-644487AF1876@cleverelephant.ca>

Do we have a guide somewhere on practices for using CooridnateXY and Coordinate? I?m just starting the RelateNG port, and wondering to myself ?should I make these class members Coordinate or CoordinateXY??. I choose XY, now my problem is ?existing function in library is defined with Coordinate as parameters?. Should I be extending the WKTWriter::toLineString method to have an XY variant? casting in my call? something else?

Paul,

I try to use CoordinateXY whenever I can. For predicates, I would
think that would be just about always. For constructive operations
it's a little more case-by-case and you can sometimes use
CoordinateXYZM (if you're not creating big arrays of points, as in
much of RelateNG) or template on coordinate type if performance is
critical (e.g. LineIntersector). If you need to perform an operation
on every coordinate in a sequence, you can use
CoordinateSequence::forEach with a lambda (see the CoordinateSequence
operator<<, which handles all coordinate types).

Sometimes older library methods can just be changed to use
CoordinateXY. It looks like this is the case with
WKTWriter::toLineString, which appears to only print Z values if
PRINT_Z has been manually defined somewhere. If we do in fact need to
print Z and M we might switch to a template.
