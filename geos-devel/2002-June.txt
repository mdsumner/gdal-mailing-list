Hi Martin,

Just a short report summarizing my activities:

1. Spent most of the time learning finer points of Java to C++ conversion
and
testing if my C++ classes work.
2. Converted Coordinate, CoordinateFilter, Dimension and part of Envelope.
3. Conversion time is reducing with each consecutive class as I learn how
different code structures map from Java to C++.
4. Total time spent from Friday, May 24 to Thursday, May 30 (inclusive) is
17
hours 13 min.

Decisions from Friday, May 31 phone meeting:
1. Create a .h file for platform-dependent values (e.g. Double.NaN)
2. Replace my additinal code in Coordinate (for 3D comparison) with code
that
uses NaN (see #1).
3. Use one .h file per package.
4. Replace 'equals' method in Comparable java classes with overloaded '='
5. Make sure that all Coordinates are values and not references.
6. Send weekly emails similar to this one.

Any suggestions for tools that talk WebDAV?   MS FrontPage doesn't seem to
work, at least not with this site.

Thanks guys,
Are we still on track to have the object model done by the end of this 
week? When we have to object model done, would that be an opportune time 
to import the source into CVS?

It's hard to say for sure. If everything goes with the same speed as it is now
then I'll finish porting the model by the end of this week. However, every class
usually have unique challenges, so something might come up that will cause me to
spend extra time trying to figure out how to port it.

I think so.

I think NOW is a good time to import the source code to a CVS repository.
That way, we can all start looking at it.  

Until such time, Yury, could you post a zipped copy of the codebase to the
mailing list on Thursdays (in time for review during our status meeting) ?

As for getting the model done, Yury, if you come across anything that looks
like a major challenge don't hesitate to call me or email the Dev list!

Well, if I receive a tarball of the source and a promise that it won't
change for a couple hours I will import it and set up the accounts. Then
everyone can start working out of the archive.

I have taken the source code Yury submitted last night and imported it
as a new module into CVS. The CVSROOT is

:pserver:username@postgis.refractions.net:/home/cvs/postgis                                         

cvs login username
cvs checkout geos

For general viewing use cvs/cvs to login.

Yury and Martin I have created read/write accounts for and will follow
up with login/passwd info right away.

Yury,
Is the CVS archive working OK for you? There have been no checkins since
it was set up.
Thanks,

Hi Paul.

CVS is working fine. The problem is that my porting doesn't go as fast as I
expected. I hit several problems over the weekend and it took me a while to
solve them and to verify that my solutions work as they supposed to.

It doesn't hurt for you to check in code fairly frequently, even if it's
broken, Yury.  No-one else is compiling the code right now anyway.  In the
spirit of XP and Open Source, it helps to have more eyes on your code in
order to validate design and style decisions.

All:

Attached is the updated copy of the Project Charter.  The text has been revised to include the results of the original GEOS kick-off meeting.  It includes a project task list which should be pretty accurate.  The schedule is still open and needs to be fleshed out.  Please review and comment if necessary.

I will also post this to the Web site.

Thanks Yury,
I am looking forward to testing out what you have in a few weeks when we
get back from our conferences. Sometime in the next three weeks, if you
could do up a Makefile to control the build process in the GNU
environment that would help. Might also be our first Linux build test ;)

Sure. I try it on UNIX from time to time to see if it will compile, but I don't
have a good Makefile yet. I'll do it sometime next week.
