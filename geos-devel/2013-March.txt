Uh, I have just learnt that ST_MakeValid is in the LibWGeom PostGIS

In any case I would still be interested in understanding why I cannot
have Python bindings in my box
cheers

 GEOSWKBReader_read_r() method copies the given WKB string two times
 instead of directly access it without any copy[[BR]]
 first copy --> std::string wkbstring(wkb, size);[[BR]]
 second copy --> is.str(wkbstring);[[BR]]

 similar one copy occurs in GEOSWKBWriter_write_r() method.

 These two methods are very important since are main entry points for
 geometry de/serialization between libraries using GEOS (GDAL uses them
 two).

 I fixed these methods and attached a short patch file.
 Consider to fix WKT read/write too.

Hi guys,

What are GEOS users and devs doing to enable M measures in their GEOS-backed solutions?  I won't worry about specialised functions at this point, but at least being able to reliably handle and maintain all XYZM ordinates is important for me.  Is it such a lot of work that it's not worth adding this to GEOS?  I saw a few messages in the archives looking at how to add measures but it wasn't encouraging ;)

Do you think GEOS will support all the SFSQL 1.2 types?

Are people moving to Boost or CGAL instead?  Would love to hear thoughts on it.

Cheers,
Tyler

Tyler,

These two may be of interest
- interest sampling, no responses
http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2011-December/005591.html
- more in-depth insights

It all depends on many aspects, but code diversity is certainly a good
thing.

Sorry for jumping in,

look also at Mike Toews thread on 7/10/2012, i think that we will not see
full ZM support for some time ...

For JTS there has been no substantive change from the situation in the 
mentioned thread.  I have however been thinking about how to add Measure 
support, both in a non-breaking way to the current JTS, and as part of a 
thorough revamp of the core Geometry API (JTS 2!).

But I'm not sure how this will translate to GEOS. From Sandro's comments 
about the performance cost of making Coordinate a virtual class it 
sounds like this would actually be harder for GEOS than for JTS.

For the record, my current thinking it should be possible to provide a 
CoordinateZM class for JTS, which extends the current Coordinate class, 
and which can be used by specifying a matching 
CoordinateZMArraySequence.  Then there's the issues of how far exactly 
the M support should extend.  WKT probably...  WKB perhaps? Other I/O 
classes (Oracle could use this...).

All it takes is time and money...

As for other SFS 1.2 types - ditto.

api is recommended because of it is more stable. But when I tried to
use it, I'm missing some functionality. Till now I run into following
problems:


When I use GEOSCoordinateSequence I cannot simply add or get a point
or add another CoordinateSequence.

In future I want to use functions for triangulation, but there is no
similar class like DelaunayTriangulationBuilder in C api.

I also don't know how to edit geometry in C api without GeometryEditor class.


These all makes my code complicated and something is not possible to
do at all. Can you tell me if I should keep on working with C api or
use C++ api? And if C api is better, are you willing to add some
functionality necessary for my library if I asked?


Thanks for an advice

Also have a look at the just-commited rev 788.  It has a fixed for an 
aliasing problem which could cause modification to input points in some 
situations. It's possibly not a problem in GEOS, if the nearestEndpoint 
routine returns by-value, rather than by-reference as in JTS.

That's what they say. The question is: how stable is "stable" for you?
I'm using the C++ API in my Code for about 1.5 years now and geos 
changed every now an then a class or method name, switched some 
parameters around or moved something into another namespace.

None of these changes created more then half an hour of work on my side. 
If you plan is to deploy your code onto a customers appliance, you'd be 
better of using the C api, but for a hobby project or a small business 
application, the C++ has proven to be stable enough for me.

Regards, Peter

Folks,

When we talk about the c api being more stable it includes things like c
calls being safer between compiler version and implementations.  That is
abi compatibility rather than at the source level.

The above also applies to gdal.

Best regards,

nearestEndpoint returns by value in GEOS.

 I tried to build with --enable-ruby, but the generated Makefiles are
 broken with

 "Makefile:237: *** missing separator.  Stop."

 The problem is in /macros/ruby.m4, line 41. It has "puts puts". This
 generates a line with "nil" on it in the Makefiles.

 RUBY_SO_NAME=`$RUBY -rrbconfig -e 'puts puts
 RbConfig::CONFIG[["LIBRUBY_SO"]] || Config::CONFIG[["RUBY_SO_NAME"]]'`

 Switching that to a single "puts" lets the Makefile be generated
 correctly.

Hello,

I'm trying to compile GEOS with Ruby support. I'm using the latest
source code from git, and I'm on Debian.

I'm a little rusty on my g++ flags and can't figure out why g++ can't
find libruby. Could someone point me in the right direction?

I'm not a C+ programmer, all the code I work with is ObjectiveC (occasionally Java) so I'm really interested in the C API.

Clearly the C API only exposes a tiny subset of the C++ API , but what decides which functions are exposed?

I have a need to get the nearest points of two geometries, but there's nothing in the C API to do that, though there is a function to get the distance between the two.
It would make more sense to me for it to be the other way round (you can easily derive the distance from the nearest points, but you can't derive the nearest points from the distance), but better would be to provide a C function to get the nearest points as well as the function to get the distance between geometries.

Would a patch to do that be acceptable (if/when I can get it working)?

OK ... here's a patch against the code in svn (assuming the mailing list allows it).

Thanks. Committed as r3792.
I had to move the test to the proper place, add to the Makefile.am,
and add a missing include to the geos_ts_c.cpp file.
No other change needed. Good work :)

Want to expose to the binding too since you're at it ?

Sorry about that ... I originally worked with 3.3.7 and then 'ported' by hand to svn.  I couldn't actually test that I'd got it right in svn since I'd need to run automeake there, and my machines use an older version than the one you are using to make releases (I guess I could build/installe the latest automake/autoconf, but that might mess up other software I work with).

I don't know what you mean by that.  If you are talking about something to do with C++ I'm probably not much good for it ... I gave up programming in C++ in 1995 (about the time templates were being added to the language in gcc) and it's really unfamiliar/slow for me to use it now.

No no, I mean a good old C code for PHP bindings: php/geos.c
(with tests in php/test/test.php).

There are also swig based python and ruby bindings but I'm not
sure anyone uses them.

 I have three geometries (Attached).

 I am intersecting the first two,and then intersect the result with the
 third geometry.

 Follows the error message

 Error performing intersection: TopologyException: found non-noded
 intersection between LINESTRING (15.1068 51.0102, 15.0974 51.0034) and
 LINESTRING (15.1068 51.0102, 15.0976 51.0036) at 15.101547860470001
 51.006448703862588

 but only when Iam directly taking the geometries from a table (see
 attachment)

 When I produce the geometries with st_geomfromtext, it works.

 When I take the geometries from the table, transform themto text,and then
 back to geometry,it also works.

 Hi all, we need this problem solved (i.e. GEOS debugged) for a large
 project over here.

 There is a budget and we invite devs to make offers.

 We are located in Berlin, Germany.

 Kind regards

Points are stored as an ordered triple of double values called x,y, and z.
Conventionally, x = longitude, y = latitude, z = altitude

 Port voronoi from JTS.  Would be really nice to add ST_Voronoi to PostGIS


 Possibly remove dependency of cgal for pgRouting


 Allow for any number of skeletonization solutions


 Thus allowing for non-polygon outputs from Raster, like an
 ST_PixelAsLinestring


 start the process toward world peace

Comment(by woodbri):

 If/When this is done, I'm willing to rework the pgRouting code to use it
 and get rid of CGAL. Ideally, we would like to care along a Z value with
 each point so we can generate a 3D triangulated surface and be able to
 then intersect that with planes in Z to generate contours.

 Thanks!

Comment(by strk):

 This ticket is to:

  1. Port the Voronoi classes from JTS to GEOS
  2. Write C++ testcases (port or write from scratch)
  3. Expose the function trough the C-API of GEOS
  4. Write C testcases

Comment(by robe):

 Just as an FYI - we discussed in sprint and Bborie mentioned this might be
 a good Google Summer of Code project since it just requires someone with
 C++/Java skills to port and not too much hand holding as to explanations.
 So probably not much mentoring involved.

Hi!
i am Vishal, pursuing my B.Tech in computer science from IIIT-Hyderabad,
India. I am also a part of the lab, Lab for Spatial Informatics (LSI). In
which i will be pursuing my MS by research degree. I saw your ideas page on
OSGeo site.I was looking at the project "adding Voronoi Diagrams to GEOS".
I was looking for JTS, and GEOS, and want to know more about it. Though i
am comfortable with C/C++ and java, but have not made any kind of a port
from java to c++. Would like to know more on how GEOS does this, so that i
could contribute to GEOS.
Anyone willing to guide me on this project?

Thanks and kind regards,

Hi Vishal, I agreed on mentoring for this project. What do you need to know
in order for partecipating to GSoC ? I'm not familiar with the process, do
you need details to write in the official proposal ?

hey Sandro, thanks for replying. I want to know details of the project. The
ideas page of GEOS talks very less about it. I want to know what exactly
needs to be done in the project that is proposed.

Figuring it out is part of the project :)

The last port has been for the Delaunay triangulation, you could start to
see how that was done. There's a git mirror of the codebase on github if
you're more comfortable with that (offline history helps).

The main problem you'll have to deal with is memory management: 
the Java version relies on automatic garbage collection while in GEOS we
have to do that manually (no refcounting, no reachable graphs).

It's usefu to start by looking at what's missing.
The GEOS codebase organization reflects the JTS one pretty closely.

Hey,
i was looking at port of Delaunay triangulation. and came to know some of
these stuff:
i looked at the method signatures from the javadoc for JTS, and saw these
signatures in the headers files 'libgeos/include/geos/triangulate'. And
their implementation in 'libgeos/src/triangulate'. And also noticed some of
the methods in QuadEdgeSubdivision.h were missing. I think there were
mainly related to voronoi cell.

I was searching for JTS's source code on git hub, and didn't find the code
for Delaunay triangulation. in 'com.vividsolutions.jts' directory i
couldn't find the triangulate directory. Where can i find that?
Can you provide me a link where i can find JTS triangulation source code?

And yes i understand the memory management problems in c/c++ that can
happen.

Thanks,
Vishal

Hey,
I found the code, it wasn't there with the initial search result on git. :P

Now i understand what you mean by what was missing. I can see a bunch of
files that are not in triangulation, so i suppose the project is to write
these missing files, which correspond to the Voronoi diagram generation.
Tell me if i am going wrong.

Thanks,
Vishal
