Paul, Norman.
Do you mind if I add generated ./configure script to GEOS CVS repository ?
Having to upgrade auto* tools on all machines makes me sick ...

Yeah, actually kind of mind... I spent a fair amount of time recently 
removing this stuff, and it is easy to get conflicts between different 
machines when the autogenerated stuff is hanging around the CVS. Just 
take a script you generated on one machine and copy it manually to your 
other machines...

I've modified doc/example.cpp to work with vectors instead
of pointer/num_pointers couple. 

Example's simple GeometryCollection generator function does what
I suggested to include in GEOS (copies all geometries in given vector).

There now is a Makefile. You can finally give it a try ;p

I've added some more operations examples in doc/example.cpp.
Adding buffer() I detected and mostly fixed some memory leaks.

A few leaks are still there due to poor exception handling
( missing cleanup ). I'm trying to find out who throws and
who doesn't (as for the 'const' case nobody bothered to write
that boring piece of code...).

I have tagged and published a release version of GEOS, numbered 1.0. 
This version of GEOS reflects the functionality of JTS 1.3 (robust 
predicates, workable functions). To use GEOS-enabled PostGIS, download

and follow the README carefully.

Please report GEOS issues to the geos-devel list!

ChangeLog is out of date.
README is empty.
doc/example.cpp is missing - but that might be wanted (is it ?)

Anyway. It builds and install out of the box on FreeBSD-4.2.

I am getting a build error with postgis.

postgis_geos_wrapper.cpp: In function `POINT3D *GEOSGetCoordinate 
(geos::Geometry *)':
posstgis_geos_wrapper.cpp:831: cannot convert `const geos::Coordinate *' 
to `geos::Coordinate *' in initialization
postgis_geos_wrapper.cpp: In function `geos::Geometry *GEOSGetGeometryN 
(geos::Geometry *, int)':

It complains about a few other const related things but this should provide
an idea.

I just downloaded the postgis-cvs tar file and geos-cvs.tar.gz files. The
libgeos files all have a 1.0.0 extension. I am using a postgresql 7.3.4
release and did a whole removal of postgis-cvs in the contrib directory. Of
course then replacing it with the just downloaded tar file.

 Currently, I couldn't get following message in executing autogen.sh against
latest geos-cvs in Cygwin.

$ ./autogen.sh

Now you are ready to run './configure'

 Could you tell me any suggestion about this?

Run autoheader first (should probably go in autogen.sh).

the following attached a test xml that intersects two polygons.

an exception was got:
Microsoft C++ exception: geos::TopologyException @ 0x0012e5e0?

is there a bug in polygon intersection?

I tried importing xie's test data into PostGIS and I get a different message:
	TopologyException: no outgoing dirEdge found (17000,46000)

It might be related to the PrecisionModel used.
Does any bell rings ?

Stuff it through jts1.3, that is the code base which matches the current 
geos. Then stuff it through 1.4 and see if it's fixed :)

Message-ID: <5A94289A9268514C8D6C0F1FF44BA0271DFDA6@venus.VividSolutions.com>

The reason for this error is that the first polygon is invalid.  It has a self-intersection around POINT ( 16196.722554 44994.293317 )

It's hard to see this visually, but you can "see" it from the fact that the first and fourth points of the polygon are the same.  The polygon shell "bends back" on itself and self-intersects at this point.

The moral is: always ensure your Geometries are valid before running spatial functions.

I found out.
First message has been given using a FIXED PrecisionModel.
Second message has been given using a FLOATING PrecisionModel.

This leads to another clean-on-exception cascade of patches
I'm about to work out. Please keep sending xml cases throwing
exception...

JTS has the TestBuilder (which is a GUI) and the TestRunner (which reads XML files).  Check the doc for more details.

I usually use the TestBuilder for trying cases like this, because it can validate Geometries and show you where the problem is

I was wrong. the example code was making the wrong call.
It has now been fixed. Contextually added both relate calls
(with and without intersection pattern).

Thanks for the answer.
I'm trying to run it with kaffe, but I think Swing is missing: 

	java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/swing/JFrame

Do you knwo where can I get it ?

I've spent more then 3 hours trying to figure out how to run JTS.
And I failed. Free java VM and compilers are not able to run it.

I think downloading the latest JDK from sun whould do the trick,
but since I've seen a 16MB for an old Swing package I assume that
would take a couple of days... 

Java is an ugly beast !

Any success stories about this ?

You'll definately need the latest Sun Java. Download the JRE instead of 
the JDK since you are only going to be running stuff, much smaller 
download.

After 5 days of setup... the response:
It is NOT fixed :)

Yes, Martin Davis already answered this.
Its a non-simple-input issue.

Hello

I have downloaded and installed the Geos library on my computer and tried to 
compile one of the examples given in the same, but get a bunch of errors.  I 
think I need to compile the same by linking the libraries at the command 
line.  I would be thankful if anyone can help me with the above.

Thanks in advance
Sunil

Can you tell which examples did you try to compile and what are the first
lines of the errors you get ?

Hello Everyone

I recently downloaded Geos Library and have installed the same on linux 8.0. 
  However, I am having problems compiling the source examples.  I have 
followed all the instructions given in the install file: a) configured with 
env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include LDFLAGS=-s ./configure b) did a make 
install c) updated the /etc/ld.so.conf file and ran the ldconfig.

In the examples given I added the path for the header files 
/usr/local/include/geos and tried to compile using g++.  I get the following 
errors:

I would be thankful if someone can help me get started and help me with the

did you try only the following?

./configure
make
make install

What Linux are your running? Which compiler version are you using? You can get 
the version with the following command:

g++ -v

Hello Steffen

I tried >./configure make make install, since it didnt work I tried the 
other option.  I am using Red Hat 8.0 and my g++ version is 3.2.
