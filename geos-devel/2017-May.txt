Hi everybody.

I'm reading the Geos source code and have no found any low-level
optimization, like the use AVX2 instruction set for Intel processors.

It's an important question because without these and others
optimization I have no significant difference between a Intel Core and
Intel Xeon processors.

Can someone tell me if the lack of optimization is intentional or just
a lack of programmers?

Amanda,

I would think that this is the responsibility of the compiler, not the 
application. I believe you can get an Intel compiler that is designed to 
optimize for these various HW differences.

Hi Steve, more than the compiler it is necessary for the data to fit
into the processor correctly.
And more, I don't have found GPU code yet.I don't know if it's will
take some advantage, however for a large scale processing it should be
necessary.
Tell me, I not confounding the things?
I see Geos has a geometry engine, however, it doesn't mean that it's a
high-performance engine or designed for massive computation.

I can't speak for the developers, but I think it is highly unlikely that 
they would do anything along these lines if it is not compatible across 
multiple architectures. There are lots of high performance CPUs/GPUs/etc 
out there each with their own special requirements. Who is going to fund 
development, ongoing support, debugging and bug fixing. And you have to 
have systems with these chips in them to support that. It is costly and 
time consuming to do this for even one of them. This also puts multiple 
different execution paths in the code that makes it harder to maintain.

I think the community would rather the developers make really good, 
portable, well tested code that works on all platforms, and it release 
in regular stable way with new geospatial features rather than focus on 
support one platform in some specialized way instead of doing new 
feature development.

My 2 cents anyway.

Thanks very much Steve, I will think more about high-performance open
source software.Because it's true, not all software are optimized and
not all communities have the resources for that, however some projects
require high-performance softwares.

Amanda,

You can take a look at GDAL if you want to see an example of what a
different project has done, you can take a look at:

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/alg/gdalwarpkernel.cpp

Search for USE_SSE and _mm.  Being that this is open source, this typically
boils down to:

1. Someone has the time / $ to implement it including tests
2. The project is willing to accept the contribution and the overhead it
may add to the project

There are a good number of issues hidden in #2.

Hi, thanks very much Kurt. :D 

Can I exchange an idea with you?

I’m starting a research to map all Debian packages to determine which
are using optimization resources for Intel processors in their source.

It’s started with a question to know how it’s the best usage for Intel
processors and I believe it can allow insights for the community.

Did you like to comment something or indicate a place where I can share
the idea with others?

#833: IsSimple=true for self-touching polygon
------------------------+--------------------------
 Reporter:  jratike80   |      Owner:  geos-devel@…
     Type:  defect      |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major       |  Milestone:
Component:  Default     |    Version:  3.6.0
 Severity:  Unassigned  |   Keywords:
------------------------+--------------------------
 Issue was found from PostGIS 2.3 with these tests:


 {{{
 select ST_IsValid(
 ST_GeomFromText(
 'POLYGON (( 320 620, 460 620, 460 500, 320 620, 320 500, 180 500, 180
 620, 320 620 ))'
      ));
 Result: "f".
 }}}




 {{{
 select ST_IsValidReason(
   ST_GeomFromText(
   'POLYGON (( 320 620, 460 620, 460 500, 320 620, 320 500, 180 500, 180
 620, 320 620 ))'
       ));
 Result: "Ring Self-intersection[320 620]"
 }}}



 {{{
 select ST_IsSimple(
   ST_GeomFromText(
   'POLYGON (( 320 620, 460 620, 460 500, 320 620, 320 500, 180 500, 180
 620, 320 620 ))'
       ));
 Result: "t"
 }}}


 JTS IsSimpleOp used to return trivially "true" for all polygons but since
 SVN revision 662 Sept 2012 self-intersecting rings are tested. GEOS should
 do the same.

Hi all,

Please join the OSGeo Code Sprint at FOSS4G Europe on Saturday 22 July 2017!

There’s always plenty to do – it’s not all about programming: 
translation, documentation, packaging, feedback, discussions, 
testing...it's all super important for a project!

If you are interested in participating, please add your project/name in 
this wiki page :

https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G-Europe_2017_Code_sprint


If you have questions/comments/ideas please let us know, by contacting 
the Code Sprint Committee at europe-foss4g (at) osgeo (dot) org

The Code Sprint Organizing Team is looking forward to see you!

As with all FOSS4G conferences, we'll be having a code sprint the day after
the conference.

The code sprint is free of charge, though you will need to arrange your own
accommodations.  

The code sprint will be held Saturday August 19th 2017 right after the 2017
FOSS4G Boston Conference.

If you'd like to attend, please add your name to the list below so we can
plan accordingly.  Also feel free to spread the word.
