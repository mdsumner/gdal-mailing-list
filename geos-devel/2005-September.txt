Few months later ...
I've found my default WKB io parameter class (biostringstream)
to be not-usable in older compilers. GCC-3.3 doesn't allow
basic_stringstream<unsigned char>, so we should provide a template
specializzation for it.

The point is that I'm not sure we should provide adapters, but
rather use whatever STL provides with an acceptably wider
availability.

Do you have suggestions about what to use for binary input/output ?
A commonly used class would be used to set interface constraints
(currently .read and .write).

I've rewritten the WKB subsystem to completely avoid
templates. Standard STL istream and ostream are used
to give same flexibility as the previous implementation.

Tests welcome.

Hi folks,

Is there a way to "wrap" GEOS to PHP and then build a "PHP/GEOS" extension?

best regards.

Eduardo: Depending on what you need to do you might be able to work  
through the MapScript wrappers. Some already exist for GEOS and  
Swig-based languages. Should be relatively easy to reproduce those in  
PHP. Certainly easier than wrapping from scratch.

Sure, check out the PHP documentation on extensions :)  There are, at  
least, no shortage of examples in the PHP
source tree.
Also, Sean Gillies has started with SWIG bindings for GEOS, and has  
implemented them for Python. You could start from there, and add and  
test the things you need for PHP (which is also supported by SWIG).   
That is possibly the easiest path. All paths involve some non-trivial  
work though :)

Thanks Steve, Paul!

In fact, I just wanna do some topological tests and you're right: it's not 
necessary to go from scratch.
Thanks for the hints!

Hello List!
Mapnik is 0.2.2a.

Mapnik is an OpenSource <http://opensource.org> C++/Python toolkit for 
developing GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications. At the 
core is a C++ shared library providing algorithms/patterns for spatial 
data access and visualization.

Main features:
1. Publication quality  rendering (anti-aliasing).
2. Expressions  based styling.
3. New build system  (www.scons.org).
4. Better python integration.
5. Two basic tutorials (python).

Frank, I'm working on the C api now, if you didn't proceed yet
you might help me testing it. The first C api will be shipped
with GEOS-2.2.0 and will be versioned 1.0.0.

Let me know.

Strk,

I haven't done anything on this.  Let me know when you have it
committed in CVS and I will do a test integration with OGR.

Ok, we have an initial implementation of the wrapper in CVS.
It's in source/capi.
Make install will install geos_c.h and libgeos_c.so.1.0.0.
geos_c.h contains some info about usage.

An important thing to take into account is memory management.
Since our goal is ABI/API protection it might be worth never
requiring users to explicitly destroy returned object, or
abstract destruction using other wrappers.

Comments welcome.

Message-ID: <43301EE6.7060902@geomega.com>

Hello,

I downloaded geos-2.1.4 and would like to compile geos for win32.  I 
have VisualStudio and opened the sln file in the VisualStudio 
directory.  However, some of the files listed in the sln file are not 
included in the download.  For example:

CTS.cpp
Stackwalker.cpp
BasicCoordinateList.cpp
CoordinateList.cpp
CoordinateListFactory.cpp
PointCoordinateList.cpp

I'm wondering if the VisualStudio files that are included aren't being 
updated with the geos updates.

What I'd really like is geos compiled for win32 and wrappers for, say, 
C#.  Before I get started myself, I was wondering if others have done 
this already and can help me out.  Thank you.

Bryan

Hallo!

Based on a package made by David Kaplan for Fedora 2 i have build a
Fedora 4 package of geos. I put it on our FTP-Server ([1] and [2])
where you can find the specfile, srpm and rpms in the corresponding

those packages.

If you find this useful please don't hesitate to add the specfile to
into the CVS repository of geos.

I think all those files have been obsoleted.
Try removing all references to them from the VisualStudio
thing. When it works feel free to send back a patch.

Thanks.

All,

I have two "layers" of geometry, set A and set B.  Set A could be described 
as the base layer, and is what I would like to compare set B to.  Set B is 
actually a bastard child of set A, with some geometries being (exactly) the 
same as those in set A, some being edited manually (actual changes), and 
some being different due to inconsistent precisions (set B was broken into 
many different pieces, edited by many people with many different softwares 
and then recombined back into a single layer).

My question is, how can I use the equals() test and PrecisionModels to weed 
out the truly equal and the "equal except different by some tolerance" from 
the "truly different and edited by human hands"?  Is it possible to say 
with GEOS, "these two geometries are equal if all of their vertices are 
within 2.0 meters"?  If so, how?

Howard

PS, I'm using the Python SWIG bindings, which emit pretty much the whole 
C++ API, but could be convinced to move to C++ if it is deemed necessary.

It's hard to use equals for this.  Equals is a little too precise for
what you want.  It would be tempting to precision reduce both geometries
and then try equals, but in general precision reduction causes topology
collapse, which means that equals can't be used (the input would be
invalid).  Also, you would still have the problem of lines with extra
vertices not matching exactly.

JCS contains a feature to do just this, called DiffGeometry matcher.  It
buffers each geometry in a potential match pair by the distance
tolerance, and tests whether each one lies in the other's buffer.  This
gives a result which is probably similar to what you want.  You should
be able to do something similar in GEOS.

GEOS is a port of the Java JTS to C/C++. 
If C# wrapper or a .NET is your target, there are already
two more current .NET ports:

http://www.gotdotnet.com/workspaces/workspace.aspx?id=51cad8c5-b80a-4753-aaf
0-612dcaa7b8df

this is port of JTS 1.6 plus some of the current CVS sources.
It is not designed to maintained the same API as JTS, so has
many improvements and extensions.

http://www.gotdotnet.com/Workspaces/Workspace.aspx?id=6262ea67-5f52-43e7-826
b-4b22bb4608ed

this is currently a port of JTS 1.5, designed to be strictly JTS API.

Best regards,
Paul

Paul,

Great.  That's exactly what I was looking for, and it was easy to get it 
running.  Thank you.

strk,

I won't be bothering with the VisualStudio stuff in the geos download 
since Paul's solution is easier.

Folks,

I just grabbed a geos-cvs snapshot and tried to build it, but it failed
on XMLTester.cpp.  There was no XMLTester.h.

I hacked around it for now, but it might be worth fixing up somehow.

Message-ID: <20050927163615.GB37484@keybit.net>

I've fixed a bug in the WKBReader code prematurely
destroying the GeometryFactory used in output construction.
The interface has also been reduced to *require* a GeometryFactory
reference in input.

The C-API now contains version informations (see the geos_c.h file)
and a new function to construct Collection from array of Geometries.

I've been testing the C-API by implementing a postgis interface
to it, and it seems to be working fine.
