Andrew,
   This is quite amazing and unexpected! What led you to decide to do 
this port?
   List in general. We now have two ports of JTS and soon will have 
three when the GEOS port to C++ is complete. What are the implications 
in terms of managing enhancements and updates to the algorithmic base of 
JTS?

We found the OpenGIS simple features specification and liked it; I was
speaking to someone at SvgOpen about OpenGIS and how we would like to
implement Simple Features and they mentioned JTS. 

We are 100% Microsoft shop so switching to Java (or J#) was not really
an option. But Java is so close to c# that the conversion was relatively
easy (if time consuming). During the conversion process I learned that
Java is more like C# than it is different. There was a couple of Java
language features that were used in 1.2 (anonymous classes) that have no
direct c# equivalent (I believe the next version of c# will have them.).


I was already a huge Open Source advocate, this project proved the point
with my manager. In some ways I almost wish I worked in Java because
there is so much more Open Source code in Java. I must say the Eclipse
IDE is also superb.

I'm excited by a C++ implementation. I'm dreaming that if it was exposed
via COM interfaces, spatial SQL could be implemented in SQL Server using
extended stored procedures. In the mean time, we are waiting for Yukon
(the next version of SQL Server); this will allow us C# to implement
spatial SQL.  

In terms of managing the updates - the change from JTS 1.1 to 1.2 was
pretty quick (a couple of days). The test cases helped enormously. Our
QA guy packed them up as NUnit (similar to JUnit).

Jens,
Is Yury OK? The last we heard from him on the list was that he was quite 
ill, and that was some time ago now. Some good news would be nice to hear...

Paul,

I will have to check this more thoroughly now. When I cam back from 
Germany, Yury told me that he has been ill. I normally don't ask for 
details because of privacy reasons. I saw Yury last Thursday. I will 
ask him how he is doing now.

Hi Everyone,

There has been some concerns about the lack of activity on the list, so I 
thought that I should clarify the situation.

Unfortunately, there hasn't been much progress on the project during the last 
month, because I became quite ill just before the holidays. I am much better 
now, but side effects from the drugs that I have to take still restrict my 
abilities to work at full capacity. Fortunately, I am finishing the last 
medication this thursday and will resume working on GEOS at maximum power ;-)
Hopefuly, I'll be able to finish migration to CoordinateList interface and 
mostly stabilize the API by the end of this week.

Yury

Excellent, Yury!  Le me know when it's finalized, and I will update my CVS sandbox and do a code review.

Yury,
I see you have started submitting to CVS again. Does the stuff you 
committed compile and work for you? Under GNU things are going awry, I 
have not investigated in alot of detail, something with private 
BasicCoordinateList methods being called in a CoordinateList context 
(where they do not exist).
What's our ETA to Fabulous GEOS Interfaces?

Hi Paul,

Yes. It compiles and works fine for me (Visual C++ 7)

Strange. I'll check it.

> What's our ETA to Fabulous GEOS Interfaces?
Should be soon. I am finishing migration to CoordinateList interface, after that
Martin is going to take a look at it and, if he doesn't have any corrections,
the API will be stabilized.

Message-ID: <5A94289A9268514C8D6C0F1FF44BA0270FD862@venus.VividSolutions.com>

Yury, I'm getting the following when I compile:

Coordinate& LineString::getCoordinate() {
	if (isEmpty()) return Coordinate();
	return points->getAt(0);
}

H:\proj\GEOS\src\geos\source\geom\LineString.cpp(189) : warning C4172: returning address of local variable or temporary

(a) Do you not get this message?  There's some other places it's occuring as well.  We need to fix this, since this message is correct - we should not be returning references to local objects.

In this particular case, the fix should be to return null (0).  However, apparently we can't return null as a reference.  In this case I guess we need to return a pointer instead of a reference.  (The other option would be to return a value of Coordinate - I can't remember if we tried this in general and found performance problems - can you?)

 Problem with Coordinate& PrecisionModel::toInternal(Coordinate& external)
Message-ID: <5A94289A9268514C8D6C0F1FF44BA0270FD863@venus.VividSolutions.com>

Yury, the following methods produce an error:

h:\proj\geos\src\geos\source\geom\geometrycollection.cpp(147) : warning C4172: returning address of local variable or temporary

Coordinate& PrecisionModel::toInternal(Coordinate& external) {
	Coordinate internal;

	return internal;
}

Coordinate& PrecisionModel::toExternal(Coordinate& internal) {
	Coordinate external;
	toExternal(internal, &external);
	return external;
}


I believe these methods are not actually used anywhere in GEOS, so we should simply delete them.
