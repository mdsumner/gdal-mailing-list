See bug http://postgis.refractions.net/bugs/bug.php?op=show&bugid=135&pos=5

Questions are:

1) Should EMPTY geometries of *any* kind return 0 from getDimension() ?
2) Should CAPI's GEOSCoordSeq_create() raise an error if requested
   to create anything but a 3d geom ? (the only one supported)

For the context, these questions came up whilst developing a Python
interface to GEOS.

Nothing serious; I just expected empty geometries to be
dimensionless! At least there should be some consistency between
GEOMETRYCOLLECTIONs and typed geometries?

I suppose the root of this question was that I expected geometries
(and CoordSequences) with only x and y coordinates to have a dimension
of 2. If I obtain the CoordSequence from a geometry where hasZ() returns
false, it has a dimension of 3 and (on my machine) the 3rd ordinate (z
value) has a value of 1.7e-308. I know that this is an inordinately
small value (excuse the pun!), but it is a value
nonetheless. Currently, because I can't check the dimensions as to
whether or not I should return this value, users end up with a z value
that wasn't initially specified when iterating over CoordSequences.

Some searching led me to the post at
<http://lists.refractions.net/pipermail/geos-devel/2003-August/000515.html>
and the fact that GEOS treats 1.7e-308 as NaN. Being able to check for
this from the CAPI (perhaps exposing the ISNAN macro in
source/headers/geos/platform.h) would enable me to work around the
dimensions issue.

Kind regards,

Homme.

Another alternative might be to provide something along the lines of:

extern char GEOS_DLL GEOSCoordSeq_hasZ(const GEOSCoordSequence* s);

AFAIK OGC SFS does say nothing about how to report dimension of empty
geometry.
MySQL spatial extensions report dim of empty geometry with value -1

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/gis-class-geometry.html

OGC SFS reserves values 0, 1, and 2 for dimensions of non-empty
geometry, so I'd suggest to use negative value.

> 2) Should CAPI's GEOSCoordSeq_create() raise an error if requested to

I think that if it can detect unsupported request, then the fact
should be reported with an error code.

Don't confuse OGC dimension (geometrical dimensionality of the described
object, Points have 0, LineStrings have 1, and Polygons have 2) and
coordinate dimension (number of ordinates per vertex, which can be 2,3
or 4 in PostGIS).

No no...  Mateus was right !
Unless I've read the bug report too fast myself :)
We're talking about OGC dimension, not coordinate dimension here.

Using negative value will be not comfortable as we're using
-1 to represent an exception.

Ah, now it's clear.
Thanks for confirmation.

I'm not sure if it's correct, but I think that as long as OGC
specification does not define a numeric value of dimension for empty
geometry, it is correct to choose any value.

Hi,

I'm forwarding some post from QGIS list about GEOS indexing support.
QGIS team is discussing about spatial indexing and pros/cons of GEOS
indexing support.

I believe it may be interesting for GEOS developer and may be there is
something worth to explain to QGIS team regarding GEOS features.

Cheers

Hi Marco,

currently spatial indexing is just a feature that no other part of
QGIS uses (so far).  But I have a long-time vision of offering some
functionality for provider if it doesn't support that natively:
- fast spatial lookup - using spatial indexing
- filtering features by attributes - using search strings
- fast feature retreiving - by caching of features in memory
- maybe also fast attribute searching - using B-trees or similar

Of course PostGIS or GRASS can do all or most of them, but e.g. OGR
has only limited support for this and some providers doesn't support
such things at all. With this we could enforce creation of new
interesting providers and allowing them good performance.

I took a look at STR tree in geos, but I must say I wasn't very happy
with it. Cons:
- lack of documentation and quite hard to find information about STR
trees anywhere
- supports only intersection query
- unable to insert/delete/modify it once built
- supports storing index only in memory
- I haven't studied the code to details but it looks like that it's
using only vertical slices for indexing instead of using regions (?)

Thus R-tree is winner for me - it's much more flexible. But it might
be interesting to compare the performance of the stuctures.

I don't think Quadtree is intended to provide access to that many

Hi!
   
  I need to use PostGIS for a project I am working on and I read in the PostGIS guide that GEOS adds some features that I need.  I tried installing GEOS using:
   
  MSYS-1.0.11-2004.04.30-1.exe

It seems autotools (or GEOS use of it) don't like spaces
in path names, consider renaming your directory to avoid
spaces.

Message-ID: <20061214145858.6BEAE2C1654@netnation.refractions.net>

Hi,

 

Can anyone please guide me how to enable GEOS Support in GDAL (Unix)? I have
installed Geos 3.0.0rc2 in my system and configured GDAL 1.32 with the
following commands:

 

"./configure -with-geos=yes". This did not work so I tried with "./configure
--with-geos=/root/usr/bin/geos-config" also.

 

Although these commands worked well and I successfully installed GDAL, when
I run the command "ogr2ogr", it gives the following error message:

 

"ERROR 6: Geos support not enabled"

 

Do I need to change anything in the makefiles of GDAL?

 

Please help me to resolve this issue.

 

Thank you.

Regards,

Elavazhagan.M

Hello List,

I hope you don't mind me posting in this development list...my question 
just didn't seem belong in the PostGIS list where Paul made the RC3 
announcment...

What I'd like to know is: does binary compatibility mean that all 
applications compiled against 2.2.x should still work?

My problem is that I've got QGIS 0.8pre2 installed, which I compiled 
againsed 2.2.x.  It definitely won't compile against GEOS 3.x yet (it 
specifically states so when running the configure script against 3.x, 
and fooling it into configuring/compiling anyway was not very 
successful).  Most applications that I compiled against 2.2.x all seemed 
to load/run fine (specifically tried running gdalinfo, ogrinfo, mapserv, 
mapscript/mapscript_csharp, and postgis) after I installed GEOS 
3.0.0.rc3 and added a link to the current module like so:

sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libgeos-3.0.0rc3.so /usr/lib64/libgeos.so.2

However, when I tried to run the QGIS binaries compiled against 2.2.x 
with the GEOS 3.x libraries, I got the following error:

qgis: symbol lookup error: /usr/lib64/libqgis_core.so.0: undefined 
symbol: _ZTIN4geos8GeometryE

I ran ldd on the qgis binary, and it indicates it is linking to the 
following GEOS libraries:

         libgeos_c.so.1 => /usr/lib64/libgeos_c.so.1 (0x00002aaaac37a000)
         libgeos.so.2 => /usr/lib64/libgeos.so.2 (0x00002aaaae2c9000)

As far as I can tell, most of the other tools I mentioned above link to 
the same modules.  So is this a problem that maybe somebody here can 
shed some light on, or is it a problem that I should discuss in the QGIS 
users list...or should I instead simply stick with 2.2.x for now?

Thanks for any help,
Mike

Binary compatibility with 2.2.x is only for the C-API, which qgis
is not using. PostGIS and GDAL are the ones I know are using the C-API.
Qgis needs to switch, but it seems no developer is finding the time
for that :(

I'd not say the problem is in finding time.
AFAIK, first the QGIS Team wants to release stable QGIS 0.8 and then go
forward to switch to C API for GEOS.

For those who can't wait, here is my dirty and unofficial
patch for QGIS:

http://mateusz.loskot.net/tmp/qgis-geos-3.0.0-mloskot-20061026.patch

It was made in October, so may be some additional tweaks
will be required but generally it should be easy to re-patch QGIS.

Cheers

MapServer and Python Cartographic Library also use the C API.

Subject: [geos-devel] Segfault with GEOSGeom_destroy()
Message-ID: <45926D1A.1030206@worldonline.fr>

Hello,

This is my first attempt to use the GEOS library, so I am probably doing
something wrong.
I just want to create a polygon and then to destroy it.

	initGEOS(NULL, NULL);	// GEOS initialization
	GEOSCoordSeq s = GEOSCoordSeq_create(npoints, 2);
	for (i=0; i<npoints; i++) {
		GEOSCoordSeq_setX (s, i, X[i]);
		GEOSCoordSeq_setY (s, i, Y[i]);
	}
	GEOSGeom ring = GEOSGeom_createLinearRing(s);
	GEOSGeom polygon = GEOSGeom_createPolygon(ring, NULL, 0);

	GEOSGeom_destroy(polygon);
	GEOSGeom_destroy(ring);
	GEOSCoordSeq_destroy(s);

	finishGEOS();			// Cleanup GEOS


The polygon is destroyed, but there is a segfault when the ring is
destroyed (same problem when the sequence is destroyed).

I have tested GEOS 2.2.3 and GEOS 3.0.0_RC3.

Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Jean-Claude

I haven't checked libgeos_c.h but I'm pretty sure that the ring
becomes owned by the polygon. Therefore you only need to call
GEOSGeom_destroy() once, passing in the polygon as the argument.

Again, check the comments in the header, but I think that the
GEOSCoordSeq s will become owned by the LinearRing, so destroying it
separately would also cause a memory violation; it will be cleaned up
when the parent linearring (or parent polygon!) is destroyed.

Hopefully that will point you in the right direction.
