Subject: [geos-devel] help for installing geos on hpux
Message-ID: <20040812160122.4210C23C0C@ws5-3.us4.outblaze.com>

Hi everybody
Im a junior administrator on Unix systems
I need to install postgresql with options to GEOS and postgis and I get troubles with GEOS  installation the problem is below

The Unix system is hpux 11.11, I used  Gcc(3.3.3) to compile GEOS and I got  this unexpected  message  when I tried "make"


CoordinateArrayFiter.lo GEOSException.lo IllegalArgumentException.lo UniqueCoordinateArrayFilter.lo Unsupport
edOperationException.lo  -L/usr/local/lib /usr/local/lib/libintl.sl -lc 
../../libtool[3192]: 25105 Memory fault(coredump)
gmake[2]: *** [libgeos.la] Error 139
gmake[2]: Leaving directory `/var/temporal/geos-1.0/source/geom'
gmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/var/temporal/geos-1.0/source'
gmake: *** [all-recursive] Error 1



I used three ways to compile but I always get the same message ......
1.- ./configure
2.-  CC=c89 CFLAGS=-O2 LIBS=-lposix ./configure
3.-  env CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/include DFLAGS=-s ./configure


Other option that I tried was compile with 64 bits (/usr/local/pa64/) succesfully but 

It is posible works GEOS (64bits)  with posgis and postgres (32bits) and how can I do it???? 

Sorry for my English! 

Regards from Argentina!
I hope that someone can help me

When is the GEOS 2.0 planned to be released?

Best regards,

Message-ID: <41257605.1090307@refractions.net>

All,
I have tagged and released 2.0.0.
The version numbering is because of the API change. Hopefully there will 
not be any more of those and we can use the 2.X.Y series for quite some 
time here on out. The JTS equivalent version number is available in defines.
A compatible version of PostGIS should be following shortly. I would 
like to get some enhancements into the documention first though. If you 
want to try it, the CVS version of PostGIS works fine against GEOS 2.0.0.

Nuts, I've been using the pending release as excuse not to work on 
GEOS/MapServer. Now I suppose I have to do something... ;-)

Luis,
The error looks like your compiler croaking unpleasantly. I have seen 
this from time to time, but usually on new code and an old compiler. 
(Compiling PostgreSQL 7.4 on OS/X 10.2 does something like this to me.)
I am afraid I have no magic answer. Try a slightly older gcc? Make sure 
your tool chain is consistent (I have found various combinations of 
linkers and compilers on solaris give different results). Try try again.
Yours,
Paul

Sean,
Sorry, I just noticed that the 2.0.0 release is missing the swig stuff. 
This is because I am using the 'make dist' functionality of our build 
environment to make the distribution archive. I am going to try and keep 
doing that, so that cutting a release is dead easy. To get the swig 
stuff into the next release, we will have to add the appropriate 
Makefile.am entries to the relevant places... as you can see, I am hand 
waving. :) I am still feeling my way with the fancy auto* build tools.
Paul

OK.  Also, if you give me a heads up next time I will check that the 
SWIG
module is still working.  It's probably broken right now.  Strk's style
of methods prototyped in headers that may or may not be implemented in
the C++ source causes problems for SWIG.  These methods have to be
explicitly ignored in the SWIG interface file.

Congrats on the new release!

Sean

It is not style, just bugs.
I tought I've fixed it already and sent you a notice
about that. Am I missing something ?

I just finished verifying that the swig package is working with the
GEOS CVS HEAD.  Which is equal to 2.0.0, right?  I've packaged up the
geos/swig directory and made it available for download at

   http://users.frii.com/sgillies/projects/geos-swig.tgz

If you are interested to try scripting with GEOS 2.0, download, copy
to the new geos directory, extract to create the geos/swig directory
and follow the instructions in the readme file.

cheers,
Sean

Subject: [geos-devel] Intersection result (again)
Message-ID: <004a01c48c41$02e19e80$f5a249c6@kipawa>

Hi all,
Here is a copy of a question I sent in July. Since I did not receive any answer yet, I post it again. 
Thanks
Maude Giasson
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm doing a small application using GEOS.

Given two simple linearRings L1 and L2, my application create a new
linearRing L3 which is similar to L1 but contains, in addition, new vertex
at the points where L1 and L2 cross.

If L1 and L2 cross on a vertex of L1, no vertex is added.

If L1 and L2 share a common lineSegment, vertex are added to L3 at the
endPoints of the segment. (if they are not already vertex on L3).

In consequence, every edges and vertex of L3 should be within L1.

1- Does a similar function already exists in GEOS (I haven't find any) ?

2- Later in my application, I look if the edges of L3 are within L1 or not
(they should be within L1). It does not work pretty well. The problem seems
to come from GEOS which is not always consistent in it's answers. In fact, I
think the real problem is from my side because I do not know what I can
expect from GEOS answers.
I've made here a little example showing some GEOS results that I don't
understand. Can someone please tell me what is wrong in that example?
Understanding this particular example will help me solving problems in my
application.

3- I'd like to have more information about the precisionModel. How does it work ?


In that example, GEOS says that the LineString AB intersects the LineString
XCDY at the point E.
However,  it says that LineString XCDY does not intersect point E.
In consequence, the line segment ED is not within XCDY.

//Coordinate :
geos::Coordinate cA(3.8727033436298370, 34.142325401306152);
geos::Coordinate cB(22.790718823671341, 34.684023857116699);
geos::Coordinate cC(15.851628303527832, 42.153842926025391);
geos::Coordinate cD(4.8595705032348633, 28.923076629638672);
geos::Coordinate cX(12,55);
geos::Coordinate cY(4,28);

//Coordinate E will be given by GEOS and the values are the following :
// E : 9.3254120334165922, 34.298458262089483

geos::PrecisionModel g_precisionModel;
int g_SRID = 1;

//-- ls AB construction
geos::BasicCoordinateList* bclAB = new geos::BasicCoordinateList();
bclAB->add(cA);
bclAB->add(cB);
geos::LineString* lsAB = new geos::LineString(bclAB, &g_precisionModel,
g_SRID);

//-- ls XCDY construction
geos::BasicCoordinateList* bclXCDY = new geos::BasicCoordinateList();
bclXCDY->add(cX);
bclXCDY->add(cC);
bclXCDY->add(cD);
bclXCDY->add(cY);
geos::LineString* lsXCDY = new geos::LineString(bclXCDY, &g_precisionModel,
g_SRID);

//-- intersection between the 2 lineStrings
geos::Geometry* gABinterXCDY = lsAB->intersection(lsXCDY);

//The intersection between lineStrings AB and XCDY occurs at the single
point of coordinate E (9.3254120334165922, 34.298458262089483)
//E is on AB and on CD. Let's verify that XCDY contains line segment
(lineString) ED.

//-- ls ED construction
geos::BasicCoordinateList* bclED = new geos::BasicCoordinateList();
bclED->add( geos::Coordinate(*(gABinterXCDY->getCoordinate())) );
bclED->add(cD);
geos::LineString* lsED = new geos::LineString(bclED, &g_precisionModel,
g_SRID);

//-- lsXCDY should contain lsED but it does not; why ?
Booleen test3 = lsXCDY->contains(lsED); // why is it false

// gABinterXCDY = lsAB inter lsXYCD
// but lsXCDY does not intersect gABinterXCDY.
// Why does it occur ?
Booleen test1 = lsXCDY->intersects(gABinterXCDY); // why is it false ?


Thanks
