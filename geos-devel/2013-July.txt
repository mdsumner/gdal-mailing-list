Subject: [geos-devel] PSC refresh
Message-ID: <20130701100723.GA30770@gnash>

I've noticed that the PSC page on the wiki is outdated:
http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/PSC

Some PSC members likely changed their email addresses, while are likely
not interested in being part of the commettee anymore.

According to RFC1, inactivity (votes, mailing) for more than two months
gives PSC members the right to to seek nominations to replace members:
http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/RFC1

As I'd like to nominate Regina Obe to join the team, for her valuable work
on quality assurance, trac management and documentation, this may be a good
time to refresh that list.

So, could still-active PSC members explicitly state their willingness to
continue sitting in the commettee with a reply to this mail ?

Please review responsibilities in the RFC1 document and think about wheter
you're willing to continue holding them. Thank you.

Vishal, I've noticed you're doing your work into an isolated
repository [1]. Instead I think it'd help if you could do it
directly within a fork of the original repository [2].

That way it'll be easier for other developers to follow progress
and test changes as early as possible in the process.

Subject: [geos-devel] PSC refresh: welcome Regina
Message-ID: <20130710140413.GD8811@gnash>

The proposal of adding Regina to the PSC got 
5 positive votes over 5 active members.

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2013-July/006394.html

So I'm declaring the motion passed with Regina Obe
replacing inactive member Gary Crawford in the GEOS PSC.

Shall Gary want to come back he's welcome to look for
a new nomination, as per RFC1.

Welcome, Regina!
(wiki updated, but please add your email over there).

Subject: [geos-devel] Getting Parse Exception
Message-ID: <CAJW9wouiqV5sZKE0kLG7hR9k00CQzgCKe1byV6yxNM9L1xbjcA@mail.gmail.com>

I was making test case for VoronoiDiagramBuilder [1] , but got this
following exception:
   group: geos::triangulate::Voronoi, test: test<1>
   problem: unexpected exception
   exception typeid: N4geos2io14ParseExceptionE
   message: "ParseException: Expected number but encountered ','"

Is it not able to parse the string data that i have passed? Or the error in
the implementation of VoronoiDiagram? If its not in the VoronoiDiagram
code, then how do i fix it?

Also, i was trying to use the C++ wrapper, directly in order to test my
code, in some "file.cpp", and after including the necessary header files, i
am getting errors like:

- mytest.cpp:(.text+0xf): undefined reference to
`geos::io::WKTReader::WKTReader()'

- mytest.cpp:(.text+0x58): undefined reference to
`geos::io::WKTReader::read(std::basic_string<char, std::char_traits<char>,
std::allocator<char> > const&)'

I think this might be some linkage problem or something like that. How do i
directly use the header files that are defined.

Thanks in advanced,

It is unable to parse the string data you have passed.
Indeed you're using a comma between X and Y ordinate values of each point
in the MULTIPOINT geometry.

You need to add "VoronoiTest.cpp" to tests/unit/Makefile.am
then run ./autogen.sh from the top-level dir and ./configure again.
Then you build with:
  
  cd tests/unit
  make geos_unit

I have already added VoronoiTest.cpp in tests/unit/Makefile.am , and run
autogen and configure. Still i am facing the same problem.

The problem you reported was:

Which doesn't seem like coming from a `make geos_unit`.

Or are you referring to:

I am referring ParseException: Expected number but encoundered ','''. This
error comes when i run my test case.

My second problem i as:
- mytest.cpp:(.text+0xf): undefined reference to

This error comes when i try to use any geos header files, in some other
program.

Your testcase is using an invalid WKT, so the error is correct.

Subject: [geos-devel] Comparing two QuadEdge objects
Message-ID: <CAJW9wovogyBrAjt0pwnDMmKx-TS1K+8=wd8kmT-+vy7LHTZzcA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

If i want to compare two QuadEdge objects, then i am comparing the elements
_rot , next , isAlive, data and vertex. As _rot and next are also
QuadEdges, it goes into a recursion, so i am using the break condition as
when both objects are NULL.

I just want to know if this is the correct way to do it? I am asking this
because i am having troubles in overloading the != operator for QuadEdge.

Thanks,
Vishal

What do you need comparison operator for ?
When needsd JTS implements a compareTo method, but I don't see any here:

The method quadedge::QuadEdgeSubdivision::getVoronoiCellPolygon, requires a
comparison between two QuadEdge objects for not being equal, that's y i
need a comparison operator. I think CompareTo is implemented in
Coordinate[1]. And the code is trying to compare the origin and destination
coordinates of two QuadEdge. Should i compare the origin and destination
coordinates to be same, in order to say the QuadEdges are the same?

You should strictly follow the JTS implementation, which is comparing
Vertex objects, not QuadEdge nor Coordinates.
It is getVertexUniqueEdges that you're talking about, right ?
Vertex class has an `equals` method (with an override accepting a
tolerance).

This part of code in getVoronoiCellPolygon, :

QuadEdge startQE = qe;
    do {
//      Coordinate cc = circumcentre(qe);
        // use previously computed circumcentre
        Coordinate cc = qe.rot().orig().getCoordinate();
      cellPts.add(cc);

      // move to next triangle CW around vertex
      qe = qe.oPrev();
    } while (qe != startQE);

The while condition is comparing two QuadEdge objects for not being equal.
So i need to override the != operator. How do it do it?

Thanks,
Vishal

I suspect that's a by-ref check, can you verify ?
Linking between QuadEdges are by pointer, aren't them ?

Message-ID: <CAJW9wosy-6AgfnevbJikt_g5YHEzmQ_kzq0Svsy16tZyrxA2=Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,
My week 4 report is as follows:

*1. Work Done:*

   - Tested some methods in geom::Triangle and geom::CoordinateList that
   were ported and also tested some methods of VoronoiBuilder class.
   - A lot of time was spend in fixing bugs and memory leaks.

*2. Problems Faced:*

   - As its a port from java to C++, we have to take care for memory leaks.
   So i had some troubles in resolving them. Also i am stuck in a comparison
   between two QuadEdge objects, which i am working out with strk, and will be
   resolved soon.

*3. Work to be done in the next week:*

   - Deal with the problem i am facing and write test cases for the
   remaining methods.

Thanks and kind Regards,

Hey strk,
I tried to compare them my pointers as:  qe != (QuadEdge*)&startQE, but
this condition is always true and goes into an infinite loop.

hey,

just figured out, that it's a pointer check. It's going to an infinite loop
because of some error in previous function call.

Thanks,

Great, good to know. You may also consider adding private signatures
for comparison, assignment and copy-ctor operators, it's an hack used
in other classes too to make sure there's no code relying on those
operators.

Hey,

I am having a problem while return a Polygon pointer from getVoronoiPolygon
to getVoronoiPolygons in [1]. When i print Coordinates of a Polygon, just
before returning it, its shows me the correct values, but doesn't work if i
print the same coordinates using the returned polygon. It gives the
following error:

terminate called after throwing an instance of 'std::length_error'
  what():  vector::_M_range_insert
Aborted

I am stuck in it for a long time. Any clues on how i can fix it?

Message-ID: <CAOE=Tx00m3r=1mpGDPcBpLqygvQdcme0_UiOPAXVaUg-h+qvrQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I has written a library in C++ which uses GEOS C++ api (I know, that C
api is recommended, but there is not enough functionality for me). Now
I want to make it work with QGIS or GRASS GIS, but they use C api of
GEOS. Is there any way, how to make it compatible?

The point is, that I need to take GEOSGeometry from QGIS or GRASS and
use it in my library as geos::geom::Geometry. But it is not possible
to convert easily between these two formats. I thought, that I could
write C api for my library which would be helpful. But now, I just
realized, that there will be still the same problem.

Does anybody have any idea, how to solve my problem? Is it possible to
do it somehow?

Thanks,

Tereza Fiedlerov?

Hi Peter,

It was giving me the error that i specified before, because the object was
been deleted when it was returned to the different function (i think this
was the reason). So i made a copy of it using clone(), and returned its
pointer, and it worked. :)

Thanks,
Vishal

Yep, those kind of errors are common when you hand around pointers to
memory that's released before use. Valgrind is an excellent tool to
find these cases (hint: use it against your testcases, those memory
errors do not _always_ get to the surface).

It's actually easy if you use WKB as an interchange format.

Comment(by strk):

 The problem seems to originate in an attempt by OffsetegmentGenerator to
 compute the offset of a zero or close-to-zero length segment, which
 results in a NaN ordinate offset.
 I guess it could be worked around this by omitting the zero or too-short
 segment from the list (I'm surprised this isn't done already by the
 simplification step).

 To recap, this one throws an exception:

 And this one aborts:

 Pretty stable functionality ! :P

 Basically this time snapping does NOT introduce any invalidity, still the

It's actually easy if you use WKB as an interchange format.

I was using WKT format with QGIS and it was slow, but maybe this could
be better. Thanks.

WKB should be better, yes.
WKT output has been recently improved too, in GEOS.

 I believe this change is correct.  It helps a llvm compiler warning on my
 machine.

 In include/geos/geom/prep/PerparedPoint.h:

 {{{
         bool intersects(const geom::Geometry* g);
 }}}

 Should change to:

 {{{
         virtual bool intersects(const geom::Geometry* g) const;
 }}}

 and src/geom/prep/PreparedPoint.cpp

 {{{
 PreparedPoint::intersects(const geom::Geometry* g)
 }}}

 to

 {{{
 PreparedPoint::intersects(const geom::Geometry* g) const
 }}}

 I recommend that for all asserts with strings, that they be changed to
 wrap the string in a static_cast.  Not very exciting, but it makes the
 stricter compilers happier.

 e.g. in src/geom/util/GeometryEditor.cpp

 {{{
 assert(!"SHOULD NEVER GET HERE");
 }}}

 changes to

 {{{
 assert(!static_cast<bool>("SHOULD NEVER GET HERE"));
 }}}

 I'm curious, what stricter compilers you mean?
 Non of these complain, using strict flags -pedantic -Wall -ansi
 -std=c++11: clang 3.4, gcc 4.8, Intell C/C++ 13.

Message-ID: <CAOodmJqGRKiW+uu0LbEvpW4D0Xp4vGMUUG-mgenYj7w+9BSS_w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Shapely users have been asking me about access to GEOSPolygonize_full_r and
I'm looking into it today. One thing I don't understand about the function
(not being much of a C++ programmer anymore) is why the cuts, dangles, and
invalid rings are only retrieved if the pointers passed in for them are not
NULL?

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/browser/tags/3.3.8/capi/geos_ts_c.cpp#L3077

Wouldn't it be better if the pointers *were* NULL since they are supposed
to point to memory allocated by this function instead of bringing in data
from the caller?

The pointer value (*cuts) can be null, the code doesn't even check for that.
But you pass a pointer to the pointer, so that the code can change the
pointer value.

Sandro,

I'm confused, what required bits you mean?
I thought this thread is about PSC voting.

According to RFC2 you're the SVN Administrator.

Actually, the same document says such role should be taken
by one of the PSC members, so I'm confused too. Have you
ever been on the PSC ?

Do we need another SVN Admin then ?
Or is someone already accounted ?

No idea.

I think I may be SVN admin due to the fact I'm sort of
spare SVN admin of number of OSGeo projects.

Any current committer can add another committer by adding the person to the list. No special admin needed.  That said, why are we even bothering with SVN at all, and why is the github tree not our main code interaction point. GEOS is a project where bug reports and fixes are especially transient, and github's collaboration model supports that more smoothly than the homegrown OSGeo setup.

Which list ? Where from ?

I guess as a first step we're waiting for all committers to be convinced
about using git. I know Paul is on his way by now, and hopefully Regina
won't mind.

Once we have that, I'd like not to loose commit <--> tickets cross-reference
for the past history. Is there any past experience about that ?

Thomas Bonfort did a ton of hard work to get MapServer migrated. He would be a good resource for someone ready to step up to doing the ticket migration.

Message-ID: <CAJW9wosKLNyNhDVMpbfBGYGW1os05N0+zB4pEHd18s0m2CJ5YA@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

My week 5 report is as follows:

*1. Work Done:*

   - This week was spent mainly, in fixing the memory leaks and
   segmentation faults. I have tested all the methods and classes that have
   been ported. Everything seems to be working fine. Thus completion of the
   Voronoi port via C++ interface.

*2. Problems Faced:*

   - No problems other than memory leaks and seg faults.

*3. Work to be done in the next week:*

   - Check for bugs because of the coming evaluation.
   - I will look into, how the C-api of geos has been implemented.

Subject: [geos-devel] Question about std::cerr in
	EdgeRing::getRingInternal() and polygonizing
Message-ID: <CAOodmJrKqveJtU7mJCUhMbsmdnr6Me1pCfQZ9qhuxDU6egN1HA@mail.gmail.com>

In polygonizing OSM data, I'm seeing a lot of this in my stderr:

  EdgeRing::getRingInternal: IllegalArgumentException: Invalid number of
points in LinearRing found 3 - must be 0 or >= 4

It's coming from:


http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/browser/trunk/src/operation/polygonize/EdgeRing.cpp#L228

Do these caught exceptions correspond to members of the invalid ring list
of the Polygonizer? In my case, polygonize_full shows me 1395 invalid rings
and there are 676 error messages, so it seems possible. Related: should the
output be restricted to debugging mode?

Thanks,

Vishal, I think the biggest issue so far has been making peer reviewing easy.
One way to improve that would be to cleanup a subset of what you've been
modifying and submit it for inclusion upstream. The subset should be small
enough to be easy to read and complete with testcases. I'm thinking it
could be changes to the Triangle class with its tests, and next one
could maybe be changes to the CoordinateList class, with relative tests.

Cleaning that up means removing all changes that are not directly
related to the focus of the work. For example making sure that you
don't have style changes for a change that's addressing adding new
functionality. The diff must be _easy_ to read as that gives your
code better opportunities to be commented on.

Looking forward for your pull request as soon as possible, I'd like
to have the time to merge it in before evaluation time.

Thank you for the care you'll put into this :)

I tried to send a pull request for Triangle class, but seems like every
commit has been sent for the review(new to git), sorry for that. I ll send
it as subsets and i ll clean it as u mentioned before.

Thanks,
Vishal

Hey,

In order to submit a subset, should i make different branches in the git
repository and send a pull request for each of them separately? Or there is
some other way?

Thanks,
Vishal

That's the way, different branches in the git repo.
I suggest you do that incrementally, not all at once.
Start with the lowest level ones and wait for them to be
merged before opening pulls that rely on those low-levels

Hey,

i have made separate branches, where i have made a subsets
of functionality, but when i send a pull request, i see that all the
previous commits are also there. And it says 23 commits awaited to
be merged, but i only want the last commit for that branch. How do i remove
the previous commits, that i made before?

Thanks,
Vishal

One thing you could do is cherry-pick the commit you're interested in
from another branch which tracks the origin master.

Example:

  # save all changes into a separate branch, check it out
  master$ git branch allchanges

  # reset local "master" branch to be the same as the origin one
  master$ git reset --hard origin/master

  # create another branch for the triange improvements
  master$ git checkout -b triangle

  # cherry-pick the last commit in "allchanges"
  triangle$ git cherry-pick allchanges

  # push your proposed update online
  # (assumes your fork remote is called "myfork")
  triangle$ git push -u myfork triangle

Please make sure to backup your changes before, just in case... :)

I committed the CoordinateList one (r3849) and a fix to it
(r3850). The fix was needed because your code was dereferencing
an iterator to one-past-last element [ .end() ].

The unit test helped catching this one, as the GNU standard c++ library
can be configured to report such problems (-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG=1)

Will look at others next week, please take these days to double
check the code. Thank you.

such a thing doesn't happen.

Hey,
My week 6 report is as follows:
Week 6 Report<http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Reports?action=edit&section=7><http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Reports#Week6Report>

*1. Work Done:*

   - Made cleaned subsets of the work done so far, so as for better peer
   reviewing for my mentor strk.
   - The work didn't include a particular fix, due to which i was getting
   memory leaks, so i was stuck in that for a while, which was later fixed.
   - Started to look into how the C-interface has been implemented.

*2. Problems Faced::*

   - I had some problems in making cleaned subsets in git, because i am new
   to it, but eventually got it. :)

*3. Work to be done in the next week:*

   - Expose the C++ api through the C wrapper interface.


Thanks and kind Regards,

 They are 2 linestrings. The first one is closed and makes a valid polygon.
 The second one is simple and crosses the first one exactly in two points.
 Theoretically their union would polygonize into 2 rings, but the union
 operation instead fails to produce a correctly noded result.

There is no documentation about how things are done, but it should
be pretty straightforward to see by looking at other functions having
an interface similar to the one you need. I guess in this case
the DelaunayTriangulation function is the closest.

Subject: [geos-devel] New overlay validation, call for tests
Message-ID: <20130731095100.GC17162@gnash>

I've just committed in trunk a change in the overlay operation
heuristic to reduce the possibility of getting invalidly noded
output.

We used to get unnoded output due to common-bits-reducer
heuristic introducing invalidities when moving the output
geometry back to its original position (the input geometries
were translated near the origin to have more computation bits).

The new code re-checks noding after shifting back and refuses
to accept a result if it isn't properly noded. This is still not
100% accurate in that results with mixed-typed components are
not really checked for self-intersection, so you can still get
such cases.

In addition, the code now checks if the input is valid before
trying the various heuristics, so that you would get a message
about that, which is usually easier to read. Example:

 => select st_union('POLYGON((0 0, 10 10, 10 0, 0 10, 0 0))'::geometry,
                    'POLYGON((0 0, 5 0, 5 5, 0 5, 0 0))'::geometry);
 ERROR:  GEOSUnion: TopologyException: Input geom 0 is invalid: Self-intersection at or near point 5 5 at 5 5

This will be in GEOS-3.4.0, which I'm trying to close ASAP, so please
run your tests against the trunk version in order to catch any problem
earlier. 

Thank you !

 This is the last ticket before we can close 3.4.0 -- you know I'm not the
 best person to deal with this. Regina, are you willing to ?

Yes I have read and accept the guidelines.

Don't you mean add myself to a authors.svn. I have tried to do so but for
some reason my commit is hanging.  So you won't see it until network
connection is better.

I think we also need to update [1] and [2] to point to the authors.svn
instead of pointing back to PSC? Agree or did I miss something?

Thanks,

 Okay I have committed my change to acsite.m4 at r3855 (its still hanging -
 not sure its just me but if its not we may have to look into what is
 haniging svn).  I'll reopen if I see winnie still having problems.

Okay I have updated http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/RFC2 to reflect
authors.svn should  be used, however I thought we also had a list used by
git or does git just use that one or does git use the list of committers on
github?

Git uses a file which isn't in the repository.
Actually, now that you mention, let's see if I handle to fix that
before your commit is included, or I've no idea what will happen with
your commit...

Hey, I'm not sure it's in the guidelines (ok, I haven't read them :P)
but you should NEVER commit something without a meaningful commit log.

Here's how your first 2 contributions to the code look like to my
git log call:

What did you hide in r3855 ? That's not allowed !

Absolutely, I made new pull requests on github like 4 days ago and closed
some of the old ones. Do let me know in case you find any problem. :)

Thanks,

I have implemented the C wrapper for VoronoiDiagramBuilder, by looking at
other functions as you mentioned before. Now i do a make install in C-API
directory.
Now to include in it in my files, I include "geos_c.h" in my
"mytestfile.cpp" and link it to geos_c. But it shows that it's not able to
find VoronoiDiagramBuilder class methods.

How do i fix it?

Thanks,

Strk,

I'm not following you here? Are you accusing me of hiding something or
simply one could assume that because of my actions.
 I admit to being rushed when I committed that, but I did remember on the
ticket to note
the commit that this was for (which I consider more important than noting on
the source itself).  

I know that's not an excuse - just saying.

All I can say is I was rushed since I had that commit sitting in my tree for
a long time and was quick to pull the trigger on it after holding
It in for so long.

Subject: [geos-devel] Do we still need/are maintaining AUTHORS - All in
	favor of #3 please vote say eye
Message-ID: <EA5732701A3C4053B0997BF018656AE9@O>

On closer inspection, I see there is also an AUTHORS file and it contains
names of authors as well, which is inconsistent with the names of Authors in
authors.svn.

I suggest we either delete authors.svn or AUTHORS unless authors.svn is used
for something else.

It would seem AUTHORS is more descriptive than the authors.svn, 

1) so my gut sense says -- lets keep AUTHORS and get rid of authors.svn

But my gut is a bit torn, because my other gut senses say

2) But AUTHORS requires me to state what role I have, but how can I know
what my role is if I haven't done much work.

3) Then my other gut sense says -- lets keep AUTHORS and chuck authors.svn,
because 
If I don't know what areas I work in I probably shouldn't be given developer
rights anyway and should just be allowed to contribute patches.

Therefore I shall go with gut sense #3.

All in favor say I for gut sense #3.
