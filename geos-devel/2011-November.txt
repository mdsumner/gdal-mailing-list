Subject: [geos-devel] Problems with BufferOp when using BufferParameters

Hi everyone,

just to let you know:

I had an interesting evening with CMake and Visual Studio and noticed 
that the test by Mateusz runs fine even with my own data. Turns out my 
problem was that I was using the build created by NMake with a Visual 
Studio 2008 project which somehow corrupted memory, even when using the 
correct C runtime library. I am now using CMake to create a .sln file 
instead and build the DLL with "shared multithreaded" runtime library 
support (which is the default in the .sln files created by CMake 
anyway). I also changed the input from a line string to a polygon, 
though I'm not sure if this still matters at all.

All in all, the buffering works without flaws now for me.

Thanks for all your support.

Best regards,
Markus

It may indicate that NMake provides messy compilation flags.
For example, it used to use /MD for Debug build by default.
I don't use NMake config myself.

Simply, CMake generates project files with default settings
as suggested by Visual Studio.
Good to know CMake works for you :-)

Comment:

 I just ran across this problem with 3.3.1 on OS X Lion, too.  I've gone
 back to 3.2.3 (which has its own problems: "SWIG is disabled, can't build
 geos_wrap.cxx" when enabling ruby and/or python bindings), so I'm
 wondering what others are doing to compile the current version on OS X.

Comment(by kyngchaos):

 Force it to compile with gcc.  With cmake configuration, add:

 {{{
 -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="/usr/bin/g++-4.2" -D
 CMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/bin/gcc-4.2"
 }}}

 And, according to the readme, the python bindings are not supported any
 more, and the devs suggest using Shapely or ctypes.

 Duplicate of #463.  Short answer is to use clang with svn trunk to get

Perhaps it's getting time to start thinking of sunsetting the SWIG
extension for Ruby and let ffi-geos start to fill the void. We've been
using the ffi-geos extension in production for months now and it's
been holding up, and it's more featureful, is easier to modify than
the SWIG bindings for the uninitiated and works with jruby in addition
to the MRI.

Of course, I'm saying this while trying to track down a segfault
that's occurring in it with Ruby 1.9.3-p0, so maybe it's not quite
ready at least on that version of Ruby. :( Still, it may be worth
considering longer-term, as there hasn't really been any development
on the Ruby SWIG extension in years, especially when compared to the
its PHP cousin and to the CAPI itself.

Anyways, just throwing it out there as an option. Cheers.

 The attached test triggers a bug which makes GEOS return an empty buffer
 (unexpected). Worked fine in 3.2.0

Comment(by strk):

 Note: JTS still fails with this, as of revision 480

 Such function should be used to fully node input linework.
 It should take an optional "precision" parameter to perform snapping of
 input vertices and intersection points to a given grid. Such functionality
 should be very helpful in improving robustness and predictability for
 clients.

#497: geos-config is a bit confused

 while it is quite clear that the C stable API is the way to go for
 development, and should be preferred to the C++ API, the geos-config tool
 is quite confused (if not wrong) about that.

 I suggest you change the --libs to provide -lgeos_c (which is sane and
 safe for most programs) and add --cclibs for others. Note that it is
 probably a good thing adding --static-libs and --static-cclibs (i.e.
 -lgeos_c -lgeos -lm and -lgeos -lm) to simplify dependency providing for
 the --static case.
