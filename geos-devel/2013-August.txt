 As I promised strk, I'm going to prepare the news release for GEOS 3.4.0.
 I'm planing to release it this weekend. If anyone has issue why GEOS 3.4.0
 can not be released sometime this weekend, please speak your peace now.

 It would be best if you just leave your comments on this ticket, so I have
 a single place to look for opinion and not have to wade thru the
 voluminous GEOS mailing list.

 I think I got everything. Though there seemed to be quite a few already in
 the list that I couldn't reconcile to a ticket, but I left them in the
 bag.

Message-ID: <CAJW9wosDnfE8M8zofyx72CZbHi88uM3WpUu4USK88y-d1Pqiag@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

My Week 7 report is as follows:
Week 7 Report:<http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Reports?action=edit&section=8><http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Reports#Week7Report:>

*1. Work Done:*

   - Exposed the Voronoi Diagram Builder C++ apis through C wrapper
   interface for the thread safe apis. Also exposed it via non-thread safe
   apis, which is a simple wrapper around the thread-safe apis.

*2. Problems Faced:*

   - I tried to test it, but whenever i try to link my file against the
   libgeos_c.so, I get some errors, which will be resolved soon.

*3. Work to be done in the next week:*

   - Resolve the linkage error and test the C-Api wrapper for Voronoi
   Diagram Builder and write corresponding test cases.

Does anyone have issue if we release GEOS 3.4.0 on August 11th 2013.  I was
thinking of releasing it sooner, but then realized there are a few more
3.3.9 things that may be fixed and appear in 3.4.0 and it would be nice to
have strk out of holiday when we release.

I can see the confusion.  The key term is out of holiday   as opposed to in
holiday
 
I was liking holiday to a box you jump into and a box you can come out of.
 
Is that clearer.
 
Thanks,
Regina

All,

I have a patch to auto generate the geos_svn_revision.h.  After fixing 
my error, I wasn't sure if I should submit a ticket after reading the 
below links?  If you want it, I can do a ticket. It's a couple of lines 
in the CMakeLists.txt and one init file with one line in it.  Just let 
me know.

np.

BTW, next time, it is better to attach patch (svn diff > file.patch) to tickets
instead of the whole files.

Comment:

 this sounds complicated and trying to do something in a micro that affects
 all intersection matrix calculations sounds a bit scary to me.  Push

Sorry to worry you, i was working on a different branch and after the
change of branch i didn't do a ./autogen and ./configure thus it wasn't
able to fine Voronoi Related methods.

New description:

 I recommend that for all asserts with strings, that they be changed to
 wrap the string in a static_cast.  Not very exciting, but it makes the
 stricter compilers happier.

 e.g. in src/geom/util/GeometryEditor.cpp

 {{{
 assert(!"SHOULD NEVER GET HERE");
 }}}

 changes to

 {{{
 assert(!static_cast<bool>("SHOULD NEVER GET HERE"));
 }}}

Comment:

 Not seeing this particular error on my mingw gcc 4.8 built with cmake.
 Though I do see this somewhat troubling notice


 {{{

 I'd just assume avoid these changes in a micro release especially since we
 plan to release soon and sounds like a lot of changes would need to be
 made to accommodate this. Pushing to 3.5

Hey strk,

I have implemented the GEOSVoronoiDiagramBuilder and have sent a pull
request along with some test cases. Please have a look.

I have completed the Project that i proposed in my GSoC proposal. After a
few more test cases , do you want me to do anything else, like start the
port of Conforming Delaunay Triangulation.

Thanks and Regards,

It was a joke, I'm sure you're not hiding anything, but I like to

I consider the source more important than tickets.

I'm sure we can blame the uneducated windows implementation of an SVN client.
Educated implementations would make it hard to commit without a log ;)

I'm not sure what we need authors.svn for, but I wouldn't drop AUTHORS.

  AUTHORS is part of the GNU Coding Standards for package distribution,
  authors.svn is a service thing.

I'm not clear on authors.svn, but in general when migrating from a
centralized VCS (e.g., CVS or svn) to a distributed VCS (e.g., git, hg,
etc.) one needs an authors file that defines a mapping from the
usernames in the centralized VCS to the full name and email address as
used by the DVCS.  Perhaps authors.svn is intended for that, or to help
those using git-svn bridges.

Actually I've an authors.git for that.
It has a different format (equal sign instead of colon).

Maybe authors.svn was for the CVS to SVN migration, it first
appeared in the repository on 2009:

  commit bda0fa996018e59fceb763bcc4f89cbaf8481042
  Author: Sandro Santilli <strk at keybit.net>
  Date:   Tue Aug 11 16:38:32 2009 +0000

      Add ChangeLog.svn rule, and auxiliary authors file

Now that I think about it, it's likely related to the generation
of ChangeLog from SVN logs. The Makefile confirms it
(ChangeLog.svn rule).

I want to release Aug 10th because I can't release PostGIS 2.1 until 3.4.0
is out and I don't want to wait any longer.

People have had a whole week to test + more since I made the aug 10 planned
announce.

I seriously doubt 1 more week is going to make them jump to test. Besides
I've been running 3.4.0 in production for some time and feel it pretty
stable.

Worsed case we find a huge bug in 3.4.0 and have to push out a 3.4.1 - no
big whoop.

Thanks,
Regina

It'll probably take one more week for me.
I'd actually love to see this in 3.4.0, at this point...

I'd say prefer tests over new things, but if you think
tests exist to cover everything then Conforming Delaunay
Triangulation will be lovely.

 I feel your pain, but I'd rather not introduce new features in a release
about to go out.
Stability is more important than feature set. I think this needs to wait til
we branch trunk to 3.5
And a lot more testing is done with it.
Since I feel it may destabilize things.

If people want it bad enough they can use 3.5.

>From my selfish PostGIS perspective, this won't be useful until PostGIS 2.2
anyway
And will give people a good reason to upgrade to 3.5/2.2.

Thanks,
Regina

Message-ID: <CAJW9wotr0tEW9yvYWRt8JiwWihBTyR9UYgdxwK0ZTxhRpwFAZg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

My Week 8 report is as follows:
Week 8 Report<http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Reports?action=edit&section=9><http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/Reports#Week8Report>

*1. Work Done:*

   - Resolved the linkage error that was coming before.
   - Tested the c-api wrapper for Voronoi Diagram and also added test cases
   for the same. Thus completing the part that was proposed in the GSoC
   Proposal.

*2. Problems Faced:*

   - None.

*3. Work to be done in the coming weeks:*

   - I will be testing a little bit more and would work on cleaning the
   code.
   - As the proposed work is done, I would start on something new. I will
   work on the port for Conforming Delaunay Triangulation for which I will
   first figure out the classes and methods required for the port.

Sorry for arriving late here, but there's a problem with generation
of platform.h.  HAVE_ISNAN, HAVE_ISFINITE, HAVE_LONG_INT_64 are all
undefined after I run ./configure (but they are defined in config.h).

I spotted the problem being carriage returns in the platform.h.in file
which probably makes the configure script unable to match the macro names.

What I don't understand is why there are no CR in my local git-svn
snapshot, maybe a missing SVN property on that file, but I've never
learnt how to manage those props with SVN and I'd rather not start
now.

In any case we need to fix this ASAP. Maybe we can call it a packaging
issue and just re-generate the tar.bz2, without changing version, what
do you think ?

Please do not do that.  Packaging systems really object to having two
distfiles with the same name and different contents, because it is
indistiguishable from an attack.  To detect such issues, packaging
systems store a hash with the name of the distfile, and check it on
download.

If you have to change the tarball once it has hit a download area, then
please just bump to 3.4.1.  There are an infinite number of version
numbers available.

In trying to update the geos package on pkgsrc, I ran into a few things.
One was DOS line endings, as others reported.

The other was a surprisingly large change in the set of installed files,
relative to what I expected from reading NEWS.  Most of this diff should
make sense to people that don't know pkgsrc details; the last line
indicates that the new version installs an empty /usr/pkg/lib/geos
directory.

Also, make check fails complaining about testrunner, and reading README
didn't explain that there was an additional test dependency.  (This is
probably not new in 3.4.0, but i thought I'd mention it.)

Delaunay triangulation and interruptability are mentioned in the NEWS file,
everything is expected, except maybe the empty /usr/pkg/lib/geos which 
I've no ideaabout.

testrunner should be another case of DOS line endings.
Can you re-check with current 3.4 branch ?

 It's too late for this round, but I believe I have come up with a fix that
 will allow me to build tar balls under mingw windows (#645).  It's a
 "Treat me like a Unix user" not a windows or Mac user.

 The issue I see it is that svn because it defaults the line break to
 native mode -- it sees me as a Windows user and kindly pulls all the files
 down with windows linebreaks. In most cases, windows doesn't actually care
 the line break (I haven't checked VS so we may need to make special
 provision). If VS cares, then its already screwed by the tar ball which is
 Unix linebreaks.

 It's only Unix/Linux that are picky.

 So solution, change all files to eol-style=LF. I believe there is an
 equivalent for git.

 Does anyone see an issue with this?

Thanks.  I didn't mean to complain about NEWS as much as run the diff by
someone who has been paying attention.  Indeed, I did see triangulation
files and Interrupt.h, and I didn't blink at those.  It was more a
number of with withdrawn files.  In particular the removal of
geos/platform.h jumped out at me as something I didn't expect.

That's probably a bug then; I'll see if it recurs with the imminent
eol-style=lf 3.4.1 tarball.

I'll retry with the fixed release when it comes.  I'm just barely able
delurk long enough to update the package.

Also:
I just noticed there is a new 3.4.0 tarball with a different hash.  It
seems 3 people spoke up about that issue, including the person who deals
with openSUSE packages, and opinion was unanimous about not having two
different distfiles with the same name.

Uhm, I wouldn't expect removal of platform.h either, as that file is
included by many other include files ! Worth a ticket.

Eh, sorry about that. I guess the only option now is consider 3.4.0 a broken
one and try to ship a sane 3.4.1 this Friday...

I think I should wait until there's a correct release tarball.

Thanks - but I'm not sure why you say Friday - isn't it as simple as

  add NEWS that
    3.4.1 has no intended changes
    3.4.0 tarball was broken and is withdrawn

  bump version

  rerun make dist?

  (consider in terms of official release approval process that this is
  just 3.4.0.1 and doesn't need revoting)

Comment(by mwtoews):

 I think it would be overkill to convert all files to have LF eol-style.
 There is only a few files that require LF only, such as shell scripts and
 other files processed by Perl (I think). The majority of files are OK with
 eol-style=native.

 I can come up with a list of SVN property changes, but not in the next bit
 of time.

 The bzip2 packaging OS must either be a POSIX system, or one that SVN can
 configured as LF system (Tortoise SVN can do this?). Git on Windows can be
 configured to either convert or keep EOLs, but it doesn't use properties
 in the same way SVN does.

Comment(by robe):

 Mike,

 thanks for the input.  No rush on change since next at best will be 3.4.1
 or 3.5. That would be very helpful if you can come up with SVN properties.
 I think we have such for PostGIS so it for example doesn't fiddle with the
 sql files.

 On note of Tortoise, maybe it does.  Haven't looked.  I've been using the
 svn and git of late with the latest msys since that provides me a single
 install with everything Posix I can tag along on my usb stick and enjoy
 the Open source offerings I've grown accustom to.  Those are both
 commandline only and haven't looked to see what switches they provide. I
 presume they provide the same switches as what the Unix/Linux ones have.

Greg,

> Does the missing platform.h cause you problems?
If its still broken for you then I guess we'll need to push a 3.4.1 since
fixing this would require changing the Makefile.am again
Which is technically part of source.

Regarding the platform.h issue -- that was in response to Frank w.
complaining that it makes it difficult to compile the tar ball under Nmake.
You see there is a  platform.h.in  and a platform.h.vc so when the tar is
built under POSIX it creates a platform.h that is invalid for Nmake (windows
users).

I had tested with ./configure and it seemed to compile okay with that
missing so presumed it was fine.  I took frank's word for it as far as Nmake
was concerned.

> I think I should wait until there's a correct release tarball.

Guys sorry. Was it wrong protocol to just fix the 3.4.0 tarball. Is it still
broken for you Greg?

I was thinking I should have given it a different name such as
geos-3.4.0-2.tar.bz2 (which is what I do when I screw up windows packaging
in stackbuilder)
But then I was worried people would get even more confused since they are
accustomed to just pulling a geos-<someversion>.tar.bz2.  
So I just (hopefully) fixed the broken build.

Well it would be really nice not to have to bump to 3.4.1 for something that
is mostly a packaging issue.
In that case I would vote for 

1) Lets find more things to complain about all this week
2) Release a 3.4.1 on Friday that takes care of the complaints.

You could say my screw-up is a window of opportunity to complain for another
week :)

Thanks,
Regina

I was only commenting that the new release did not install platform.h;
the fact that it's not in the tarball sounds right, because files
generated by configure should be omitted anyway.

I haven't the foggiest idea if the missing *installed* platform.h is an
actual issue.  But when an include file is part of the de facto public
interface, sometimes people rely on it.  I didn't see in NEWS that it
was no longer installed; perhaps it's documented that it's buggy to
include it (like linking with the C++ library), in which case there's no
issue.

The replaced tarball seems ok (the only remaining issues are the changed
installed file set, which may or may not be a bug, and test failures,
which don't appear to be related to the tarball creation process).

Yes, it's a protocol violation (according to the world view of packaging
systems) for there ever to exist two distinct tarballs with the same
name.  There have been instances of malicious replacement of tarballs,
and this sort of thing sets off alarm bells.  Hence trying to keep the
non-malicious instances to zero so the alarms are all real and not
ignored.

I don't understand why you say that; version numbers are just symbolic
names, and there are plenty of them.  It's quite normal to withdraw a
numbered release and have a new one quite soon when there are issues
like this.

If that's warranted separately, then that's of course fine.

 This was logged as an issue in PostGIS at:

 Doesn't seem to be an issue in 3.3

 Just in case that doesn't crash for you, the original I was trying it from
 was a statement generated by the PostGIS garden monkey script.

 Can you reduce this down to the 2 geometries and 1 double inputs to

Comment:

 r3885 in trunk, r3886 in 3.4 branch (3.4.1), r3887 in 3.3 branch (3.3.9).

 NOTE: the _new_ snapping code was only ever released in 3.4.0, the version
 in 3.3 branch was never released yet

Here are the differences in installed files from 3.2.8 to 3.4.1.  There
are a lot of new 'linearref' and 'triangulate', and a few other changes,
but the things that do not make sense to me (from reading the NEWS) are:

  many algorihm/*.h withdrawn
  geos/platform.h withdrawn
  new empty directory /usr/pkg/lib/geos

With 3.4.1, I ran the tests on NetBSD 6, i386.  I got 3 failures. Are
these really "XFAIL" as some test driveres woudl call them, and known
bugs and not indicative that anything is worse on my platform than
anywhere else?

pkgsrc is carrying the following patch.  It strikes me that probably there
should be a configure-time feature test instead.

   added so far.[1]
   - Tested the c++ apis as wells as c-apis against difference tolerance
   values.
   - Looked into the various methods in JTS required for the port
   of ConformingDelaunayTriangulationBuilder.

*2. Problems Faced:*

   - None

*3. Work to be done in the comming week:*

   - Port methods required for ConformingDelaunayTriangulationBuilder class.

I'm afraid yes. They seem to give slightly different results than
expected, but the bug they refer to was to not return a result at all
or (in the case of the bogus noding) not returning a validly noded
result.

So, actually, only the last one should be reviewed to check if the
output is correctly noded, but I think node checking is one of the
things done better in 3.4.0.

The real fix for this would be to implement pluggable test checker
in the XML test runner (like it is done in JTS) and use a better
test for comparing expected vs. obtained result. Specifically a test
for the noding in the case of the noding bug and a test for similarity
in the others (we do have HausdorffDistance test that would help in there).

Any volunteers to help there ?

Many files were erroneously installed in algorithm/ when they belong

This is unexpected. We discussed this at 3.4.0 release time and was
considered a packaging bug, wasn't it ? If it's still in 3.4.1 we need
a 3.4.2 ASAP to fix it. Maybe it takes a BLOCKER ticket to be considered

Indeed configure is already checking for isnan, but the block
you see, full of OS checks, is run when HAVE_ISNAN is undefined.
The correct fix would indeed be with defining a possibly different
macro for HAVE_STD_ISNAN or fix the configure test to use full
qualification when trying.

I'll love to see that ugly block in platform.h removed, but I'm afraid
we don't have a large enough set of builders to catch a bug as soon
as it is introduced. If you have a patch for configure that fixes the 
*BSD case I'm happy to apply it.

Sorry, I didn't realize that you thought it was a bug in a packaging
system.

r3866 removed it from geos_HEADERS in include/geos/Makefile.am, as part
of "#601 do not incude platform.h in tar ball."  It makes sense not to
include it in the tarball as it's a generated file, but taking it out of
geos_HEADERS prevents the installation as well.
I think we want nodist_geos_HEADERS = platform.h.

>>   new empty directory /usr/pkg/lib/geos

The problem is in php/Makefile.am.  pkglib_LTLIBRARIES is defined, and
it seems that required directory is created, even if "if ENABLE_PHP" is
false and the rest of the code isn't executed.  Arguably this is an
automake bug.  I would suggest hoisting the if ENABLE_PHP conditional up
a level and only having the SUBDIRS+=php if php is enabled, which will
prevent executing any of the php/Makefile.am.

Agreed, and committed in trunk as r3896
Can you double-check it works fine on your end ?
If so, it shall be backported to 3.4 and 3.3 branches.

I actually don't get the pkg/lib/geos dir created when I configure
here. Not with a false ENABLE_PHP, at least.

 $ ./configure --prefix=/tmp/gt && make install
 $ find /tmp/gt/ | grep pkg # no hits

And for the larger isnan issue:

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/651


From reading the g++ headers, it seems that it's wrong to use bare isnan
in C++.  But I could well be misinterpreting that.

You have any issue applying the #650 patch.  I can do it and test on my
different systems if it looks okay to you.

Yes, same 3 failures with Ubuntu and Debian. I have identified the

Message-ID: <CAJW9wov6SxhJ9QzZGKG__VJH8_e06TwXXozZ27teC2E+ud984g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey,

I have figured out classes and methods required for Conforming Delaunay
Triangulation port. And it looks like, its way more as compared to Voronoi
Diagram Builder.

Here are some of the things that needs to be done:

-- index::kdTree.
-- index::kdNode.
-- geom::LinearComponentExtractor
-- triangulate::ContraintVertex
-- triangulate::ConstraintSplitPointFinder
-- triangulate::NonEncroachingSplitPointFinder

I will try to complete it within the remaining GSoC time. But if its not
complete in that period I will complete the remaining it after GSoC period.
:)

Thanks and kind Regards,

 Revision r3853 introduced 3 regression failures for 32-bit systems, as
 tested with Debian, Ubuntu and NetBSD. There does not appear to be issues
 with 64-bit versions of Debian / Ubuntu.

Funny, this problem appears to be only on a 32-bit OS, but not 64-bit.
Greg, is your NetBSD 32-bit?

Comment(by strk):

 Can you check if the query in
 http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/527#comment:3 gives you any record in
 output ? Absence of any record means that the output from ST_UnaryUnion is
 correctly noded, and that's what the test for #527 is about.

The system I tested on is "i386", which is one of many flavors of 32-bit
CPUs.

On amd64 (x86_64), floating point tends to use SSE instructions, which
do not have extended precision temporary values.   But on i386, floating
point registers have more bits, and hence -ffloat-store.   So it would
be interesting to see

  results on arm, sparc, sparc64 (and alpha and vax :-)

  results on i386 when compiling with -ffloat-store

  results with clang instead of gcc

Theoretically -ffloat-store is already used when available,
is that working for you guys ?

There's also a ticket to replace -ffloat-store with
-fexcess-precision=standard

I did 'make dist' on trunk, and (locally) update the package to that,
and got platform.h installed.
So I think the change is fine.

With trunk and a different box, I didn't get $pkglibdir created.  So I'm
not sure what's going on, but suspect an automake bug.
If I figure anything out I'll file a ticket.


Also, I ran diff from the 3.4 branch to trunk (to figure out if php
pkglibdir handling had changed, which it hadn't), and there were a
number of unexpected differences (from memory, couldn't send earlier due
to netflake):

  3.4.1 NEWS entries missing from trunk

  ChangeLog had far far more differences than I would expect, and looks
  to be a summary in one branch, more verbose in the other

  whitespace differences in the recent nodist_ fix

Comment:

 I get 3 regression failures (on winnie Windows 2003 64-bit R2) my 32-bit
 mingw64w32 gcc 4.5.4.  I get a lot more for 64-bit on Winnie (but I think
 something else is going on with that).  On an old windows xp I tested (I
 think 3.5 doesn't compile at all and that's a recent development with
 latest commits I think)

 I've attached my make check log.  Haven't check to see if its the same
 failures as Greg

I think it's ok to copy the NEWS over once 3.4.1 is out.

It looks like a difference in the version of SVN being used to generate
the file. The one one committed in r3890 does not contain the filenames.

Filed a ticket for this: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/654

Not important, but thanks for noticing

Comment(by robe):

 Just tried on my window 7 64-bit (gcc 4.8.0) but using the same chain as I
 had on windows xp.  Have that one turned off. It gives different error,
 but the 64-bit is not being picked up


 Here is from config.log

 {{{
 configure:17207: result: no
 configure:17225: checking whether int64_t is 64 bits
 configure:17285: i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o conftest.exe -g -O2   conftest.c
 >&5
 conftest.c:35:1: error: unknown type name 'int64_t'

 function 'exit' [enabled by default]
      exit(0);
      ^
 configure:17285: $? = 1
 }}}



 I think it might have been that mingw64 patch at #568 that the other
 Sandro sent which seems to work fine under my gcc 4.5.4 install.  I'll see
 if I can fix this myself in such a fashion to make both happy welcome for
 ideas though.

 The reason I didn't notice this on my gcc 4.8.0 chain is that I use CMake
 for gcc 4.8.0 (postgresql 9.3) and have never bothered using libtool for
 it.  On cmake it passes with flying colors.

 I meant to say compiling my 32-bit mingw64-w2 (gcc 4.8.0) on my windows 7
 64-bit box.

 gcc 4.5.4 mingw64-w32 just gives those 3 errors I already complained
 about.

 On NetBSD 6.1_STABLE i386, with geos 3.4.1, I get 3 regression failures.
 On NetBSD 5.2_STABLE amd64, with geos 3.4.1, all regression tests pass.

My build did use -ffloat-store.  So apparently the issue is not about
excess precision.  I have run paranoia on NetBSD/i386 - with
-ffloat-store it passes, and there are issues without it.  On amd64
paranoia passes.

I updated the '32-bit regression errors' ticket, but regression tests
pass on NetBSD 5 amd64, and had 3 errors on NetbSD 6 i386.

I wonder if there is some type that is 32 on ILP32 and 64 on LP64, and
it's having overflow, and this isn't about i386 fp precision.  I'll see
if I can manage to build on sparc (it may take all night), which is
ILP32 but does not have extended-precision double, just regular IEEE754.

Hmm.   I don't know how widespread that is.

If the extra precision causes real issues (vs slightly different but not
wrong answers) then there is perhaps something else going on.

 I think this is a harmless error, but its preventing tests from
 continuing.  This I'm seen in winnie's building of 3.3.9
 (I need to set test for 3.4, 3.5)

 I suspect it will be an error for 3.4. and 3.5 too.

Hey,

  I am porting geos/index/kdtree now. I have created the Makefile.am for

I am not able to figure out the problem. Any pointers on how can i fix it?

Thanks,

You must add geos/index/kdtree/Makefile to the list of generated Makefiles
in configure.in

 I understand the current travis setup is building using CMake and Automake
 with both GCC and clang, but only as 64bit. If that's correct it would be
 nice to add a 32bit build to the matrix.

Subject: [geos-devel] What's still pending for 3.4.2 ?
Message-ID: <20130822102040.GA23904@gnash>


Changes since 3.4.1 so far:

  - Use a double for PrecisionModel scale, avoiding overflows (#652)
  - isnan workaround OS detection missing NetBSD, DragonFly, Sun nuance (#650)
  - Do not distribute platform.h and version.h, but install both (#601)

Plus the CAPI library version was properly set to 1.8.2 (3.4.0 and 3.4.1)
both went out versioned as 1.8.0. A confirmation of this from the packagers
would be helpful: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/653

In addition to the above, critical issues, there's the annoyance of format
change for the ChangeLog file: http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/654

Is that all we need closed for a good 3.4.2 release or did anyone notice
anything else to fix ? It would be nice to get a 3.4.2 out ASAP (tomorrow?),
given none of the existing 3.4.x releases are working...

Also have the 32-bit regression failures people should confirm is fixed for
them.

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/652 

I'm still having issue on windows regression failures with 3 or 4 failures,
but since I think those have always existed I'm okay to release with them.


Devrim,

I know you had trouble compiling in Fedora because of some ruby thing, not
sure if that is covered/ticketed in our changes or not.  I don't see it.

Before we do another run, can you make sure you can compile with latest
nightly tar ball? http://geos.osgeo.org/snapshots/

Thanks,
Regina

Comment(by gdt):

 Presumably 32bit and 64bit above have an implicit "Intel" qualifier :-)
 It would be really nice to have a CPU that is not Intel, and one that is
 big endian.

 It is great to see regular builds with a compiler other than gcc, too.

Comment:

 I'm afraid other-than-intel cannot be done with the online travis-ci
 service.
 Need to look at our Jenkins bot or at the future buildbot (if any).
 Would you be willing to provide a non-intel slave host for either jenkins
 or buildbot ?

 This seems like a feasible route to follow in order to make Travis CI
 build and test GEOS for Windows:

 {{{
 For minimal Windows support, you may go this route:
 * Install these packages: binutils-mingw-w64-i686 gcc-mingw-w64-i686
 g++-mingw-w64-i686 wine
 * CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc CXX=i686-w64-mingw32-g++
 * Link everything static, use the link flags -static-libgcc -static-
 libstdc++
 * run tests with wine.
 }}}

No one seems to have responded to Sandro's and my note

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2013-August/006620.html

So I guess that means we are all ready?

If so I'm planning for another some time later today early tomorrow after I
test windows a bit and see if there is any hope there in fixing those issues
I have under windows.

In meantime those who had trouble compiling from tar, can you please try the
latest snapshot from here

Message-ID: <CAJW9wosS6xDN91M+zn_sJKNdJCyNFs=5Y+aCU3DD7fHyzcnF7w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

*1. Work Done:*

   - Figured out the classes and methods required to
   port ConformingDelaunayTriangulationBuilder class. Main classes are as
   follows:
   -- index::KdTree.
   -- index::KdNode.
   -- triangulate::ContraintVertex.
   -- triangulate::ConstraintSplitPointFinder.
   -- triangulate::NonEncroachingSplitPointFinder.


   - Ported the functionality for making a Kdtree and doing insert, and
   query operations.
   - Had to make a new branch for QuadEdgeSubdivision (required for
   Voronoi) because the previous one was unable to rebase to the svn-trunk.
   strk has made some comments, which i will be working on in the next week.

*2. Problems Faced:*

   - None.

*3. Work to be done in the coming week:*

   - Ported the remaining classes mentioned above.
   - Write Test cases for kdtree classes, which have been ported.

I was able to package 3.4.2 for pkgsrc without any issues, and it passes
'make check' on NetBSD 5 i386.  Thanks for applying patches for the
things I reported.
