Subject: [geos-devel] Killing Slack room ?
Message-ID: <YdXcFhxi9CsGbHfL@c19>

After upgrading the Matrix room versino from 1 to 9 we lost the Slack
bridge, and it I'm having trouble adding it back (glitches).

Does anyone have problems with just removing references to that room
from the website ( http://libgeos.org/development/ ) and only keeping
the Matrix room ( https://matrix.to/#/#geos:osgeo.org ) ?

The topic of the Slack room already mentions moving to Matrix

Well if it's never going to work or whatnot, I guess, but surprise, I'd rather use the osgeo slack and deprecate the matrix.

We have the same issue with PostGIS by the way.
I prefer matrix.  That said, I think there is a way to keep slack going and
understand many people prefer it so we should probably keep it.

But it does take I think someone to resetup the bridge.  I have no idea what
that entails.


Thanks,
Regina

I take it as a vote for NOT killing it, but do you realize PostGIS
already advertises Matrix (and the bridged IRC) as the official chat platforms ?
https://postgis.net/support/

I'm not sure if the Slack bridge can be made to work, for GEOS, some
people in the #matrix IRC channel said it may be a matter of time
(timeouts kicking in) but I'm not sure it'll ever happen.

The bridge is back.

Postmortem: upgrade of the Matrix room created a _new_ room and I was
unable to bridge the new room becuase a bridge was still up in the
_old_ room. Dropping the bridge from the old made it possible to set
up the bridge in the _new_ one. Fixed both GEOS and PostGIS channels.
