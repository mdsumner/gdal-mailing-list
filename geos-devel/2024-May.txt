Subject: DOI (digital object identifier) for GEOS
Message-ID: <CA+K_q_rHg11+WtTuTPzF2nq2Q+7s6ecUrNUPFuOcueOAyPehyA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Would there be any objection to me uploading the most recent release of
GEOS to zenodo.org? Uploading a release generates a digital object
identifier (DOI) that can be used to cite a specific release of GEOS, as
well as a "concept" DOI that can be used to cite GEOS in general. At least
in the US government, having a persistent identifier for software citation
is becoming a requirement for funding.

As an example, here is the zenodo.org entry for GDAL:
https://zenodo.org/records/11175199

Hi,

Just to mention that GDAL, PROJ and GRASS rely on the zenodo-github 
integration, so that when a github release is published, zenodo 
automatically creates a new DOI for it (as a "child" under the generic 
DOI for the software). GRASS has notes about that in 
https://grasswiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GitHub-Zenodo_linkage

Uploading a release generates a digital object identifier (DOI) that can be used to cite a specific release of GEOS, as well as a "concept" DOI that can be used to cite GEOS in general. At least in the US government, having a persistent identifier for software citation is becoming a requirement for funding.
