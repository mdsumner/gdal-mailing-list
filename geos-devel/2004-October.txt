I realized I was confused about the topic (dumb me!).

The problem is that postgis does not really support 3d,
but just a z value on each point.

This means that any postgis (and OGC) areas is a plane,
possibly NOT parallel to the ground but still a plane.
An exception is using polygon holes, which make
a collection of trapezoids (dunno the word in english)
formed by connecting segments of the holes and the outer
ring.

This means you cannot have a BOX3D as a 3-dimensional
polygon geometry. So envelope3d(geometry) is IMPOSSIBLE
to encode !

Would GEOS do better ? Thats a good question !
(I don't think so)

I've cross-posted this to various lists, so I'm sorry to those who are
getting duplicates.
 
I'd like to beef up my Mapserver applications with some geoprocessing
functionality - buffers at present, other functions will follow.  For
now I am playing with PostGIS and having great sucess, IF my features
are all stored in the database.
 
What I'd like to be able to do though, is take a feature from WMS
getFeatureInfo or WFS and be able to buffer that.  As a test of this, I
took the GML from a getFeatureInfo request and parsed it manually to be
a WKT string.  Then used PostGIS to run the buffer.  Apart from slight
precision differences, it appeared to be close to what PostGIS would
have done with it's own feature (the WMS request was done against the
same feature through MapServer).  
 
Now that I confirmed this is all possible, what I am missing is that I'd
like to be able to 
a.. do the conversion from GML to WKT with some script/library
b.. do this with a GML stream
c.. ultimately do this without PostGIS database dependancy.
 
I figure that GEOS can do the geometry format conversions, is this
right?
Has anyone written a library for linux/windows that will let me talk to
it with PHP?
 
I'm prodding these lists in hopes of finding out what else is going on
out there in this area. It would be fabulous if this was all built into
Mapserver, but from what I can tell, it's just a thought right now. 
 
Thanks!!

Liz,

Steve Lime is doing some work to add GEOS support within MapServer itself.
I'm not clear on exactly what he plans or how he will expose it for use.
Hopefully he will respond as well.

The OGR library has also recently added support for a variety of GEOS
operations.  Currently these are exposed to the OGR Python bindings, but
not to the OGR PHP bindings which are not really being actively maintained.

OGR can also consume GML files and return them as OGR features on which
you can invoke GEOS operations.  I will however note that the OGR GML support
is a bit flakey.  It might be fine if you are working against well known
WFS or WMS servers with well behaved GML.

The GML handling in OGR includes support for whole GML files as a layer of
features as well as low level support for turning a single GML geometry
definition into an OGR geometry object.

If you are interested in having the OGR PHP bindings extended to support
the GEOS operations, we could talk about that.  It is possible that DM
Solutions would be willing to do the update (they wrote those bindings), or
I might even get past my current PHP phobia and do it myself.  Or better
yet, someone in your organization!

Another possibility would be to switch some of your work to Python, but
I know that mixed scripting environments can be quite a mess.

One final note, I understand the there is work going on for an AsGML()
operator for PostGIS.  I am not sure if they are planning a corresponding
operator to read in a GML geometry and convert it to PostGIS format.  If
they did that, you could stay focused on doing the operations within PostGIS.

Best regards,

Liz,

there is a php_ogr library that we built, it is just a set of php 
wrappers for ogr functionality.  Frank added GEOS support to OGR 
recently.  It should be possible to extend the php_ogr wrappers to wrap 
the ogr functions that talk to GEOS.  You could then use OGR to open any 
suitable format, perform GEOS operations like buffer, union, etc and 
then write the results out to a supported format.

It would also be an interesting exercise to add GEOS support into 
php_mapscript if OGR is built with GEOS support.  It should be possible 
to use mapscript shapeObjs with OGR/GEOS and perform suitable operations 
that way.

The php_ogr stuff is available on www.maptools.org/dl/php_ogr.

Cheers,

Paul

I've got a skeletal setup in MapServer now. Nothing functional just a
setup of how this will work. Basically I propose extending the standard
shapeObj to contain a GEOS geometry. Then I have to write the code to go
between GEOS geometries and shapeObj's. The wrappers for the GEOS
functionality then become really easy. You'll see things like
msGEOSBufferShape and so on. You'll never see the GEOS geometry and will
deal with shapeObj's. That way you can draw or use those features easily
with existing MapServer code. I also plan to make use of the PROCESSING
block as a mechanism to trigger processing. For example you might do
something like:

PROCESSING
  BUFFER 500
END

Which would trigger all features to be buffered before being released
to MapServer or MapScript. MapScript would then gain a whole bunch of
geospatial analysis methods attached to shapeObjs. That's what I'm
planning anyways. Now just to find the time to write the converters. WKT
will likely be too slow for this purpose.

Steve,

There already exists, for mapscript users, a SWIG interface to the
GEOS library.  It's in the GEOS CVS.  I think this is what programmers
should use rather than processing directives, which are only really
needed for the CGI program.

If I can chime in with an almost unrelated one...

what about adding a WKT layer type to mapserver  - should be simple if
GEOS is being worked in. Unless things have changed recently, the only
way to specify a shape was by means of explicit points or polygons. The
WKT layer would make specifying a generic shape a lot easier -
particularly if a program writes the mapfile, as mine do all the time
(and you should see the 150+ LAYER sections for the USA polygon... :)

cheers,

Subject: [geos-devel] "self intersecting" polys
Message-ID: <BD90585A.133F8%greenberg@ucdavis.edu>

Martin (and others):

    I read your Sept 4 response about self intersecting polys, and I was
wondering where I can go to put in my two cents about "standards" -- self
intersecting polys are EXTREMELY frequent in GPS-collected data -- when
someone walks a poly with a GPS, he/she often over steps their starting
point, or random GPS error can lead to these small errors.  Seeing as how
GPS is a pretty important part of spatial analysis, the ability to include
these type of data seems critical.

Wouldn't a facility to clean these topologies be preferable to defining 
them as "correct" :) I think the standards definition is fine, there 
just needs to be a way to massage collected data into what the operator 
really "means" by it.

Message-ID: <20041012144006.GA17936@freek.keybit.net>

I realized we missed operation/polygonize and
operation/linemerge builds in released GEOS.
I'm now working on it.
I think this would make an 2.1.0 release (new interfaces).

Subject: [geos-devel] packages -> namespaces
Message-ID: <20041012162750.GA50078@freek.keybit.net>

Working on the new Polygonize and LineMerger classes
I hitted an old problem with the GEOS port.

GEOS has a single namespace (geos).
JTS has a hierarchy of namespaces (packages?).

So - for example - JTS has:
	- ...jts.planargraph.PlanarGraph
	- ...jts.geomgraph.PlanarGraph

In GEOS this has been ported as:
	- geos::planarPlanarGraph
	- geos::PlanarGraph

.. which I find *very* confusing ..

What about using a hierarchy of namespaces in GEOS too ?

Please consider I'm not either a Java or a C++ guru, so if
you find this to be a stupid question don't try to understand
the guruness beyond it :p

	Subject: [geos-devel] GEOS and Mapserver
	
	
	I've cross-posted this to various lists, so I'm sorry to those
who are getting duplicates.
	 
	I'd like to beef up my Mapserver applications with some
geoprocessing functionality - buffers at present, other functions will
follow.  For now I am playing with PostGIS and having great sucess, IF
my features are all stored in the database.
	 
	What I'd like to be able to do though, is take a feature from
WMS getFeatureInfo or WFS and be able to buffer that.  As a test of
this, I took the GML from a getFeatureInfo request and parsed it
manually to be a WKT string.  Then used PostGIS to run the buffer.
Apart from slight precision differences, it appeared to be close to what
PostGIS would have done with it's own feature (the WMS request was done
against the same feature through MapServer).  
	 
	Now that I confirmed this is all possible, what I am missing is
that I'd like to be able to 
	a.. do the conversion from GML to WKT with some script/library
	b.. do this with a GML stream
	c.. ultimately do this without PostGIS database dependancy.
	 
	I figure that GEOS can do the geometry format conversions, is
this right?
	Has anyone written a library for linux/windows that will let me
talk to it with PHP?
	 
	I'm prodding these lists in hopes of finding out what else is
going on out there in this area. It would be fabulous if this was all
built into Mapserver, but from what I can tell, it's just a thought
right now. 
	 
	Thanks!!

Folks,

I finally obtained a copy of Visual Studio 2003, and I'd like to try to 
build GEOS with it.  I can't seem to find a copy of platform.h, although it 
appears there is a template for autoconf? there (platform.h.in).  How do I 
need to modify that template to have a usable platform.h in Visual Studio 2003?

Thanks

good day everyone!

i've encountered this problem with geos 1.0 up to goes 2.0.
unfortunately, i still encounter it with geos 2.0.1

whenever i run make, i get this error:

cd . && \
  /bin/sh /root/installers/geos-2.0.1/missing --run automake-1.7 --gnu  Makefile
configure.in:23: version mismatch.  This is Automake 1.7.9,
configure.in:23: but the definition used by this AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
configure.in:23: comes from Automake 1.7.8.  You should recreate
configure.in:23: aclocal.m4 with aclocal and run automake again.
make: *** [Makefile.in] Error 1

so i run aclocal, then automake. 

then when i run make again, i get this:

./configure: line 19506: syntax error near unexpected token `long'
./configure: line 19506: `PGAC_TYPE_64BIT_INT(long int)'

i am using an i686 pc under fedora core 2. automake is 1.7.9. 

thanx in advance and more power! :)

Micheal, when downloading a packaged version you should not need
to run automake, autoconf or whatever.
Just configure; make; make install;
If you got a CVS snapshot use the ./autogen.sh script.
Please, let me know.

hello sir! thanx for the respone. i figured out what i was doing
wrong. i extracted the package using konqueror instead of the usual
bunzip2 command. it usually works with gunzip files. i've installed it
now. sorry for the slight disturbance. thanx again! :)

If you don't see a swig/ directory in that package this means
the SWIG part did not handle to go in 2.0.1 distribution.
Pull down a CVS snapshot to take a look at it.

Niki,

You may have to pull it directly from CVS if it is not in the
nightly snapshot.  I've also got it available from my own website
until the situation is corrected

   http://users.frii.com/sgillies/projects/geos-swig.tgz

Download, copy into your GEOS directory and extract.

cheers,

Hello,

What is the proper way to destroy a geos::Polygonizer object completely?
I'm getting the polygons given by polygonizer.getPolygons(), using them  
and then destroying them manually. Externally, I could also destroy 
getDangles(), getCutEdges(), getInvalidRingLines(), but by looking at 
Polygonizer::~Polygonizer(), it seems I would also need to manually 
destroy other protected members (holeList, shellList), which can be done 
via a subclass.  Am I missing something?

thanks

I don't think you should destroy getDangles(), getCutEdges() and
getInvelidRingLines(). Also, holeList and shellList should be
destroyed by Polygonized destructor.
I'm working on it. Polygonize and LineMerge are newly added classes
still bugus.
Thanks for the report.

Subject: [geos-devel] WKTReader memory leak
Message-ID: <41773F0C.2090201@ucdavis.edu>

Hi,

While trying to process a bunch of polygons from a shapefile, I noticed 
that the holes vector in WKTReader::readPolygonText(StringTokenizer 
*tokenizer) doesn't get released if the wkt happens to be invalid (say, 
it's not a closed ring) (well, valgrind helped me find the leak). 

Thanks for your attention.  GEOS is great!

Subject: [geos-devel] Windows build for geos 2.0.x
Message-ID: <20041022161854.GG32158@mrcc.com>

Greetings,
I am interested in finding out if anyone has successfully built GEOS 2.x
on WIN32 (native, not cygwin). I took a look through the list archives
and found a few questions regarding building on windows but didn't find
any reports of success. 

QGIS now uses GEOS to identify and select features and we plan to
incorporate more functionality as well. This works fine on Linux of
course but I am in need of a GEOS build on WIN32.

Comments, suggestions, help, and DLLs welcomed!

Thanks,
-gary

GEOS was originally developed is MSVC++, so there should hopefully not 
be any major issues w/ compilation under microsoft native. Probably just 
the footslog of building a project or nmake file is required.

Actually check w/ the postgis list, as the guys doing windows native 
pgsql/postgis must have also done windows native geos.

I originally hacked together a make file and ran into a number on 
WIN32-unfriendly things during the build. 

I'll repost to the postgis list ...

Thanks

Message-ID: <Pine.GSO.4.53.0410260918590.4108@tombola.informatik.uni-kl.de>

Hi group!

I have inastalled PostgreSQL (version 7.4.5) and want to install PostGIS
(version 0.9.0).
But PostGIS needs the geos library. So I downloaded the geos source-files
and started to compile it.

(The versions of PostgreSQL and PostGIS are compatible with the downloaded
geos version.
The directory with the source code is:
"/home/n_faust/software/software-source/geos-2.0.1/".
The directory for the installation of geos is:
"/home/n_faust/software/software/geos-2.0.1/".
And the OS of the computer where I would geos install is Sun Solaris version 5.9.)

First I got the following error message during compilation:
(I don't know the exact error message that the make command had shown.)

IsValidOp.loT    no such file or directory

So I changed the file name
"/home/n_faust/software/software-source/geos-2.0.1/source/geom/IsValidOp.loT"
to
"/home/n_faust/software/software-source/geos-2.0.1/source/geom/IsValidOp.lo"
and started compilation again. Now it worked... but only until the
following error message occured:

make[2]: Entering directory

Can anyone help me, please?
Thank you in advance!

Carlos,
I've found and fixed some bugs in the Polygonizer code.

I dunno if this is nice to have but I've implemented the polygonizer
so that the getInvalidRingLines caller gets ownership of them, and
in case noone asks for them they are destroied at object destruction
time. This has the side-effect of allowing the call to be performed
only once (subsequent calls will get NULL).

Anyway, please try your code now and any suggestion on the 
reported semantic is *very* welcome.

Sounds good.  I will try it and let you know how it goes.

Thanks!
