Subject: [geos-devel] Build problems on Solaris
Message-ID: <485780F8.3010605@sun.com>


I've raised ticket #186 to address some problems with building
on Solaris, using the Sun compiler suite.

I can prepare a couple of patches for this.  I guess prepending
namespace specification on those standard library functions that
don't have them should be uncontroversial and unproblematic ?
The same with including <typeinfo> where that isn't done ?

Magne,

You are more than welcome to provide us with patches fixing GEOS for Sun 
compiler. Absolutely, using fully qualified names and including missing 
headers won't break anything, but is more than recommended.

Please, attach patches to the Ticket #186

Thank you!

Is there any documentation for GEOS functions?

Or is it all still in the source code?

Load GEOS website

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/

and follow the GEOS API link in the Other Information section.

> Or is it all still in the source code?

It was/is in the source code but also published on the Website as API 
reference powered by Doxygen.

Greetings

I've added a patch for this to #186.  I've also raised a separate ticket
for a couple of minor issues with autogen.sh and configure.in
(Ticket #192)
