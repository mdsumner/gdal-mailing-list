By contract, if the inputs are invalid, the output are not guaranteed
not only to be valid but also to be computable.

A valid input should always result in a valid output, or it would be a bug.

Turning an invalid geometry to a valid one can be tricky, you may want
to look at the ST_MakeValid funcition in PostGIS to see how it is
implemented.

Hi Sandro.

Thank you for your answer. As far as I have checked, I'm starting out with valid geometries only. So if valid inputs guarantees valid output, I guess I have to go bug hunting.

Regards, Casper

Yep. Consider updating to latest geos development version,
either from 3.4 branch or trunk, at your choice.
Just in case the bug was already fixed...

Actually, ST_MakeValid  is not the only tool around now. A few months
ago, an article [1] was published to implement an alternative geometry
validity checker, named "prepair" [2]. In essence: "prepair performs
more or less the same as the PostGIS 2.0's function ST_MakeValid(),
but is faster, scales better to massive polygons" [2]. I haven't
looked at the tool myself, but stumbled upon it while digging through
literature.

Subject: [geos-devel] using geos C Api
Message-ID: <CAJvUf_veHJXpAcZdxdSPeJ3Q=LMnBS0_R3x12=H+G57kKXODkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
trying to use Geos C Api in a  Cpp program.
The Cpp programm uses CMake.

Apparently the easy way to incorporate GEOS is by copying the QGIS solution.
I copy the FindGEOS.cmake file
<https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/cmake/FindGEOS.cmake>
then ad the path to it in CMakeList.txt
    set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH} "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}")

then using the regular
  FIND_PACKAGE(GEOS REQUIRED)
fills GEOS_LIBRARY and GEOS_INCLUDE_DIR.

Then I add GEOS LIBRARY has a target for link :
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(simple_snapping.bin ${CERES_LIBRARIES}
${GEOS_LIBRARY})


After that I'm stuck,
If I try to use Geos function I get an error by
ld :
" geometry_function.cc:-1: error: undefined reference to
`geos::io::WKTReader::WKTReader()'"

Anybody has an idea of how to fix this?

Cheers,
R?mi-C

Is geos::io::WKTReader::WKTReader used by your geometry_function.cc ?
That's the C++ API, not the C one.

Just a guess: nobody added the new RectangleIntersection code into
the CMake build script. I know I didn't, and I'm pretty sure nobody
else did. The autotools build scripts are the officially maintained ones,
do you have problems using them ?

The CMake configuration does not maintain explicit list of files,
but it should collect all .cpp files [1] inside the src subtree.

Uhm, then maybe geos_c.h was not regenerated ?
It gets generated from geos_c.h.in by ./configure, with autotools.

There is a command in the root CMakeLists.txt for it, so it should be generated

Well, I tried building it myself but for me it fails as it tries to
build .cpp files that happen to be in the source dir but are not meant
to be built ... Does it build for you ?

Remi, can it be the geos_c.h is being generated in the build dir but
another older version exists in the source dir ?

If there are .cpp files which are not meant to be compiled, then
the CMake will grab them too, due to the globbing.
That may be a problem, indeed.

I haven't tried, no Linux handy ATM.

Ok,
I'll try tomorow using exclusively functions from geos_c.h.
Is there some kind of example/tutorial arround?

Another 2 quick questions :
I would like to perform a polygon/polygon intersection.
  I can't find if there is a shortcut for the case where the two geometry
are disjoint (in which case the intersection would be empty geom)
  Shall I put myself this kind of shortcut before calling intersection?

About the new rectangle shortcuts . Are the rectangle bbox (north/South
East-West oriented), or are they real rectangle (oriented bbox)?

Cheers,
R?mi-C

Some update for the record:
fresh git clone compiles fine with classic autotools.
fresh git clone compiles fine with cmake
fresh git clone compiled with autotools then cmake (in a "build" directory
) compiles fine.

I think it's about using a vbox shared file system.
For the cmake way, you have to use the linux file system, no win shared
folder.

Thanks all for the advice !

Cheers,
R?mi-C

I'm afraid not. All docs are in the header file.

You should put yourself this kind of shortcut.

The rectangle shortcut in Geometry::intersection is disabled at compile time.
Rectangle would not be oriented, anyway, for RectangleIntersection.

Thanls Strk !
I ended doing all the things you said
(manual shortcut, no rectangle).

Indeed this C api is easy to use one has understood how it works.
Would you agree to put on the wiki a simple tutorial ?
I would write it like : how to read a geom, make a buffer, write a geom,
 from scratch.
It would be very short (30 lines)

Cheers,
R?mi-C

Sure !
You don't even need my agreement, as long as you do it :)

Make it as long as you think it's needed.
