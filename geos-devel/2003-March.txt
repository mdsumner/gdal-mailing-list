Current status: All ported code has been cleaned up. Most of the Coordinate
class instances replaced with references. Most of methods from Coordinate class
have been inlined. This resulted in noticeable (~15%) performance improvement
(see output below).

To do: Add rawGetAt method to CoordinateList* classes (Norman's recommendation
that should result in even better performance). Write a couple of  example
programs using new CoordinateList interfaces. Bring the GEOS up to date with the
latest JTS version (1.3), add namespace and continue the porting (with isValid).

After some fussing with OS/X development tools, I am pleased to report 
that GEOS compiles and the test cases run under OS/X, in this case on 
an iBook. The classic performance results are as follows. Yet another 
platform-dependent clock though -- multiply by 10 to get the correct 
clock time in miliseconds. This is on an 800Mh G3.

Yury, what's the ETA on getting some example programs using the API 
committed?

Current time for the million point test (March 3):

Not bad, not bad....

Using JTS 1.2, I get the following timing: (Pentium 1.1 GHz / Win2K / Sun Java 1.4)

n Pts: 1024000    
Executed in 20.627 s

(Paul, what processor/OS/JVM is your timing based on?)

Just to make y'all jealous...  Using the version of JTS 1.3 currently on the lab bench, the benchmark is:

n Pts: 1024000 
computeIM: # segment intersection tests: 234    
Executed in 1442 ms

This speedup is mainly due to eliminating the tests for self-intersections in input polygons (which are assumed to be valid).   It won't be too hard to include this in GEOS.

I'll do them first thing during my next scheduled GEOS work slice, so they
should be done on Wednesday (or Tuesday evening if I'll finish some other things
early).

Current status:
1. One example on how to use CoordinateList classes is done (in "examples"
directory).
2. isValid package and 2 of its support packages (index/Sweepline and
index/Quadtree) are ported. It doesn't run yet, because of the external
dependencies (mainly from operation/Overlay), but that should be fixed soon ;-)

To do:
1. Port the operation/Overlay and 2 remaining index packages
2. Write anothe example program for CoordinateLists based on arrays (Martin's
suggestion)
3. Bring the GEOS up to date with the latest JTS version (1.3) and add
namespace.
4. Add rawGetAt method to CoordinateList* classes (Norman's recommendation
that should result in even better performance).

Tomorrow I am going to ASI Exchange in Vancouver, so I'll not have that much
time to work on GEOS this week. This week I should be able to finish 2 remaining
index packages and write a new example program and probably port enough of the
operation/Overlay to run the isValid(). Next week I should be able to finish the
Overlay and items 3-4.

Vinko,
GEOS is not static by any means, it's still being actively added to, 
and the primary developer (Yury) is not developing under GNU. So GNU 
build support is only added "after the fact" by one of the GNU users, 
like me or Norman or Fernando. You can hack the build yourself and get 
it running (maybe, if Yury has it committed in a buildable state, he 
usually does, but occasionally not) or you can wait for one of us to 
clean up the latest changes for GNU.  One of my tasks when I get home 
will be packaging a "release" which *will* be static, and easily 
buildable, against which we can link the new GEOS-enabled PostGIS. We 
definately cannot expect to deploy PostGIS/GEOS against the CVS version 
of GEOS. :)
TTYL,
Paul

Hi all

As we are getting more ancillary programs in the source tree 
to allow for future development , I propose we change the 
directory structure slightly

to something like

$GEOS_DIR
    examples
       algoritms
       geom
        ....
    interface
        postgis
    macros
    script
        perl
        python
        ....
    source
        algorithm
        geom
        .....
    test
        bigtest
        test
    tools

I have added in placeholders for some 'possible' additions 
for emphasis < think SWIG wrapper >

Comments/Thoughts/Flames ?

Message-ID: <001401c2f1e1$6e1d8840$b9354d18@yury>

Current status:
1. The following packages are now completely ported:
a. isValid
b. Two remaining 'index' subpackages (chain and invervaltree)
c. Overlay
2. Several classes from 'algorithm' that depended on 'index' packages are ported
now.
3. isValid and Overlay are being debugged.

To do:
1. Finish debugging isValid and Overlay (should be done this week)
2. Write another example program for CoordinateLists based on arrays (Martin's
suggestion)
3. Bring the GEOS up to date with the latest JTS version (1.3) and add
namespace.
4. Add rawGetAt method to CoordinateList* classes (Norman's recommendation that
should result in even better performance).

Things left to port:
1. ConvexHull class from 'algorithm'
2. 'operation/buffer' package
3. 'operation/distance' package

OK, GNU compile is back in business w/ the latest changes.

Martin,
Is there a test suite for the operators? We've got a billion (uh, 490) 
tests for the predicates, but I haven't seen one for the operators.
