 enterprisedb havent yet integrated GEOS>= 3.3.9 in their Linux installers,
 although its saying Postgis 2.1.1

 Also see:

 Is there an ubuntu ppa around from which i can install postgres + postgis
 2.x with geos >=3.3.9 ?

 Cheers!

Hello,
      My project is using Qt(Windows) as our dev tools. And we need to use geos,I don't know how to build the geos dll in Qt.
      Is there anyone build it in Qt?
      Hope to get your answer,thanks very much!

There is nothing specific to Qt that is required to build GEOS.
Simply, follow one of the instructions for Windows
http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/#Source
and you will get GEOS .dll and .lib produced.

Alternatively, install geos-devel package using https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/

Then, configure your project pointing to GEOS headers and library to
link against,
as you would do with any other non-Qt library.

Best regards,

Subject: [geos-devel] Concurrent access to geometry objects
Message-ID: <CAHrc2eRHCPPjMH+9OZ1KLhgsKpr_xuyWG4i2W2GjJefTSCaSJw@mail.gmail.com>

My apologies if this has already been answered a million times, I can't
seem to find the archive of this list in an easily searchable form.

I would like to be able to concurrently access geos objects which are not
being modified by other threads. As of now the only thing I know of which
prevents this is the internal envelope which is created lazily.

My first question is whether anyone can tell me if this is true or not, or
if there are other parts of geometries which may be modified by const
functions. If not I can probably make sure the envelopes are precomputed
but I don't want to go through all that and find out it doesn't work, or
worse that I think it works until it doesn't.

If that is not possible I would be willing to do the work to add to geos
whatever is necessary so that this can be done, if the work would be
accepted into geos and if I can get some guidance on the best way to do it.

A related question - is there any reason the factory functions are not
virtual? It seems as if it makes the factory not very useful as you can't
inject your own types into the mix. It seems like if they were it could be
used to create objects with synchronization primitives in them and thus
solve my problem.

Thanks for your time.

Mr. Santilli,

Could you possibly find a little corner of the GEOS site for promoting FOSS4G 2014 by using one of the conference logos that will hyperlink to our site at site?  

I?m attaching a zip file of the logos, but they are also on GitHub at this link:  https://github.com/pdxosgeo/foss4g2014-wordpress/tree/master/logo_images 

We also have excellent logos on our ?Spread the word? page at https://2014.foss4g.org/about/spread-the-word/

The conference will be held in Portland, OR this year from Sept 8th to 13th and the web address for FOSS4G is https://2014.foss4g.org

Thank you for help and any advice you may want to give, and we are looking forward to seeing you and members of the GEOS community there.

Best,
Chris MacWhorter

Envelope is the only one, for the Geometry class.
There are more mutable members around the code though, see:

 grep -R mutable

Improving multi-threaded usecases is a welcome contribution.

No reason, other than focus having mostly been on the C-API
and no subclasses available/needed in the code. I guess it
would be nice to expose a way to provide external factories
trough the C-API too, btw.

Nope, the exit code from ./configure should be telling you there is no
problem. You'd just not get to build the python and ruby bindings.
If you _need_ them, then you'll have to install the development packages
for python and ruby (swig should still not be required unless you want
to develop the bindings).

Can i open geos as a project in Visual Studio 2008 Express? I've tried to
create new project from existing code, but got many errors "LNK2019

Hi everyone,
    In GEOS,I can use validOperation to judge whether a polygon is self-intersecting.But is there a method to break the polygon to make it be a non self-intersecting one?
    waiting for your answers?Thanks very much!

I've also failed to get geos.lib working in my project. I downloaded
version 3.4.2 via SVN and built it with NMAKE. Then i included geos.lib in
my project, added paths and tried to run this code:

    initGEOS(NULL, NULL);
    char* wktPoint = "POINT(10 10)";
    GEOSGeometry* point = GEOSGeomFromWKT(wktPoint);

Here GEOSGeomFromWKT threw exception "A buffer overrun has occurred...".
I'm using NMAKE from Visual Studio 2008 Express, Windows 7 x64.
