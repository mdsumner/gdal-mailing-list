GDAL PSC,

When we wrote the GDAL RFCs on sponsorship, we provided an escape clause to allow us to direct resources to other projects upon which GDAL depends. Our sponsorship numbers are still increasing, which provides us an opportunity to directly support some of those projects, and one of them is obviously GEOS. GEOS provides all of the geometry algebra support for GDAL/OGR and many other open source geospatial softwares including Shapely, PostGIS, GeoPandas, MapServer, and more. 

Dan Baston of the GEOS PSC has been identified as the developer with capacity and interest in the next year to take on GEOS development on APIs and performance, which he has a long history of doing for the project. This support should allow him to work longer, multi-release upgrades that will provide strong performance and convenience benefits for the project.

I motion to provide the GEOS PSC with a $50,000 USD grant to address performance, API, and other work that does not attract directed funding in GEOS. The GEOS PSC will be responsible for coordinating work tasks, rates, and development timelines. Howard Butler or Even Rouault of the GDAL NumFocus liaison team will coordinate dispersement as directed by the GEOS PSC and NumFocus rules.

Thank you again to the GDAL Sponsors https://gdal.org/sponsors/index.html who have made this kind of grant possible. A better GEOS makes for a better GDAL.

Howard

I'm very pleased as a GDAL PSC member and a sponsor who depends on the full
stack.

Howard,

I'm in favor, but first I'd like to see the GEOS project adopt a code of
conduct. Sponsors look for one these days, right? It's probably a good move
for GEOS in the long run.

As usual, GDAL has a reasonable template to work from.

I'm happy to have a CoC and happy to just copy someone else's. Other thoughts?

I noticed that the GDAL CoC is in fact just the OSGeo CoC, which is convenient, as we are an OSGeo project.

The code change is here.

Declaring this motion passed with +1's from

DanielM, EvenR, NormanB, TamasS, HowardB, MateuszL, FrankW, KurtS, and SeanG

The GDAL PSC is fully delegating these resources to the GEOS PSC to use as it sees fit. Paul Ramsey has agreed to be the administrative contact for the GEOS PSC, and will coordinate the effort in regards to payment sign-off, work task development, rate negotiation, and reporting to the GDAL PSC. 

Howard

PS: As a member of both PSCs, I will abstain from any funding or resource direction votes in the GEOS PSC to avoid any potential conflict.

Thank you, all. I'm honored by your support.

Please don't hesitate to open issues on the GEOS GitHub page to share any
ideas you have about how GEOS can better support GDAL and friends.

Gerald,

Part of my funded maintenance activities on GDAL also benefit to some of 
its dependencies with which I'm familiar/a committer, and PROJ is the 
first one among those (15% of my time to date if my stats are right).

Dear GEOS PSC,

Great to hear about a grant to help the project along.

My feedback is to make sure that the funds are spread around, not just 
to one developer, but also to the (even more critical) parts of software 
projects that never receive funding, yet are so important to end-users: 
documentation, testing, and packaging.

I know it is 2022, and we have so many corporate influences in FOSS4G 
that it's hard to see through the activity/smoke, but, we should always 
try to make sure that the funds are spread around to as many parts of 
the project as possible.  For example, 50k USD could be shared by the 
GEOS PSC as:

   - 25k development
   - 10k documentation
   - 10k packaging
   -  5k testing and releases

That is a fair plan for actual project "maintenance". QGIS.ORG (the 
registered entity behind QGIS) & the QGIS PSC does an excellent job at 
spreading the funding around to all parts of the project, which creates 
a "product" feeling to QGIS (a well-rounded result).

My rule of thumb, is that for every 1 hour of development in a software 
project spent, it should take approximately 8 hours of further testing, 
documentation, and packaging by others, if done properly. (instead of 
one funded developer doing an hour of development, and squeezing in a 
few minutes of docs often by the same developer).

I hope my feedback can be received well by the GEOS PSC, and they could 
keep this feedback in mind the next time funding comes along.

Thanks, sent from the east coast of Canada,

-jeff

I was thinking that some work on documentation would be great as well.

As developers it can be hard to know where to focus on what needs
documenting.  Suggestions are welcome.

As for testing, there is this GEOS issue recommending creating more C API

Hello GEOS friends,

It is with a heavy heart that I request to be removed from the GEOS PSC.
The reasons are twofold ? I'm at a stage in my career that I'm as good as I
once was (though I'm as good once as I've ever was) -- I digress, but
seriously, I'm no longer doing active development of any kind so my
opinions would be suspect.  And secondly, at Safe we no longer are making
use of GEOS directly.

That said, I'll continue to cheer on from the sidelines and do what I can
to support ongoing GEOS efforts (like being happy that some of our GDAL
funding may end up helping here), because I believe a solid GEOS is a very
good thing for the community at large, and the world quite frankly.

Thanks all for the amazing progress you've made over these past 15 or 20
years(!), and I look forward to seeing  what the future holds.

Dale

Thanks Dale, for your time with the PSC over the years and for Safe's early support and validation of GEOS as a library that could to "real work for real people" back when that was, curiously, an argument that had to be made!
Yours,
Paul

While I appreciate the sentiment behind this, I do not believe the particular breakdown below is reflective of the current needs of this project.

- This is a library. The users of the project are not pro-sumers or non-technical, they are C and C++ developers. Users who are not C and C++ developers are supported by the particular project that is embedding the library, whether it be PostGIS, QGID, GDAL or Shapely. The documentation requirements are therefore relatively meagre. 
- This is a library with 15 years of technical debt. From its very birth, GEOS was built on foundations of sand. Hewing over-closely to the JTS code, it built up a burden of heal-allocations that have only been slowly pared back. The first professional services contract I let for improvements was... to track down the huge piles of memory leaks generated by that festival of heap allocations. Between the date of birth in the early 2000's to now, the C++ language itself has been transformed (several times), leaving the code base in a somewhat mish-mash state, some "modern" other ... not.
- This is a library with some big jobs that are no fun and yet fairly foundational. Off the top of my  head: support for M coordinates and rationalizing that against an efficient implementation of coordinatesequences, support for ISO circular arc geometry structures, efficient use of in-place data for more 'no-copy' operations.

The breakdown below perhaps makes sense for a project like QGIS, but for a this particular project with this projects current needs, focussing on development and developer-level documentation needs (good/better doxygen, example programs, consistent and clear in-code commenting) for this round is where we are going to go.

ATB,

P

Has the attitude about keeping the codebase in sync with the JTS code
changed? I would potentially do some work on this project if this isn't a
requirement -- it seemed difficult to make changes that would make the code
more accessible with strict adherence to the JTS structure.

Sorry if this isn't the right thread for this question.

I think a new thread title makes sense.

I guess it depends a lot on what those changes are, because one thing we don't want is making porting out of JTS a whole pile harder. 

Is that a strict restriction, or something else?

Like, there's already affordances for C++ lying around that result in differences. JTS has lots of places where it returns a null Coordinate pointer to indicate a failure, and GEOS ends up working around that with things like Coordinate::isNull(). Similar stuff for Envelopes. The access of Coordinate out of CoordinateArray is a little mismatched to how JTS does it because it's returnng a const Coordinate& instead of a pointer to a Coordinate. Each of these makes porting a wee bit more of a brain exercise, but the trade-offs are worth it in terms of being to stack-allocate things more, work with references, etc.

Message-ID: <000c01d8273f$68c14870$3a43d950$@pcorp.us>

Well touching the homepage and closing a ticket, I could not find where we
tell people how to get support from the project.

It wasn't on the home page -  https://libgeos.org/

But instead was buried in the Development header -

https://libgeos.org/development/


Can I move the geos chat / matrix /irc /slack links to the home page
Or have a support link for this

It's not intuitive that headers are even clickable since for example
"Development" header is clickable, but "News" header is not.

Also I would expect this channel/mailing list information to be repeated on
the readme here:

https://github.com/libgeos/geos

Where I assume where a good chunk of people first discover GEOS.

Anyone have issue with me making these changes?

Thanks,
Regina

pdal.io, mapserver.org, gdal.org, and proj.org have a convention of putting this stuff under a catch-all "Community" landing page. That way it was a little more obvious it was a section about how to connect or communicate with the project and could include more stuff than just a link to the mailing list. One possible way to go about it.

Hi All -

 ? from an ecosystem point of view, both the OSM project and recently 
Safe-Software have indicated that they no longer call GEOS directly at 
all.. in the case of OSM they now rely on the GDAL-level interfaces, for 
Simple Features constructed geometry.

 ?New developers may benefit from GEOS C-interface calls.. project like 
GeoPandas from python may benefit. Developer outreach is part of the 
mission of OSGeoLive linux. New GEOS developer material is welcome there 
(by some members of the PSC for OSGeoLive).

 ? best regards from Berkeley, Calif?? --Brian M Hamlin??? / MAPLABS? /?

This whole page should actually be called community 

It's all about interacting with the community and a little about GEOS
governance

https://libgeos.org/development/

So perhaps the best thing to do is, as you said, rename this page community.
Put it as a link directly on the home page - something like

If you need support or want to get involved, checkout our "Community and
Support" page with link to the renamed page.


And also add it to the side bar as a standalone  Community link.

I don't know how others feel about the header "Navigation", but I'd really
like to get rid of it.
Everytime I look at the word "Navigation"  I feel like it's a big use of
real estate to tell me the obvious.

Thanks,
Regina

Hearing no complaints I have reshuffled things as follows:

1) Created a new section - Communities (I called the folder community, not
sure how it became Communities)
2) Move the development, psc, and coc out of development into the community
folder
3) Renamed development.md to support.md
4) Linked to the support page from the home page.
5) Got rid of the Navigation header
6) Added community resources to the git README.md page.

Thanks,
Regina
