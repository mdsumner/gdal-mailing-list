In my case, the examples were build directly by the main makefile.
Are you trying to compile the examples with make or through a direct 
g++ commandline call? What is the g++ commandline call - either your
direct one or the one from the makefile (This should be reported just
before the error message).

Hello Steffen

I am using the following command to compile:

g++ CoordinateListsExample.cpp

It gives the errors that I had copied in my earlier mail.  Do I need to link 
the libraries when I am compiling the program.  If I have to, then could you 
please tell me the command line to link and compile.

Thanks
Sunil

configure breaks with the following error:

Could you make sure that you have the Cygwin gcc-g++ package installed?

I think it would be a good idea to have configure explicitly check for 
g++ - but I don't have the necessary automake/autoconf experience to add 
this check.

Steffen,

thanks! i needed to install the gcc-g++ package and now it compiles well. i 
think the check for gcc-g++ is already included in the configure-process. 
the output of configure (when gcc-g++ wasn't installed) was:

------ checking whether we are using the GNU C compiler ................. yes
.....
.....
  ----- checking whether we are using the GNU C++ compiler ................. no
....

but i didn't know what to do at this point.

Subject: [geos-devel] buffer 0 distance
Message-ID: <20031211133213.A81041@freek.keybit.net>

I've found no special handling for buffer calls with
0 as the distance parameter, but indeed it seems to
be needed since on buffer('LINESTRING(0 0, 45 54)', 0)
call a 'GEMETRYCOLLECTION(EMPTY)' is returned.

Do you all think returning a clone of the passed geometry
is a good policy when asked to return a buffer(0) of it ?

Please let me know.

--strk;

PS: Dave, I've discovered this trying again aime's bug.
    the buffer(geom,0) was returning a different geometry
    then the input once. After modification of the BufferOp
    made sure result was exact copy of input the bug showed
    again.

Subject: [geos-devel] bugfix in collection's copy constructor
Message-ID: <20031211170408.A82236@freek.keybit.net>

GeometryCollection copy constructor used to swallow copy
the vector of referenced geometries. Fixed to call clone()
on each of the sub-objects [ there should be a more elegant
C++ construct for this but the clone() call works fine ].

Nonetheless the geos2postgis bug is still there.
Here is a reduced exploit:

-- This works (4 geometries in collection)
select buffer('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1))', 0);

-- This faults (the 5th geometry in collection)
select buffer('GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1),LINESTRING(0 0,1 1))', 0);

Note that these test only works if the buffer function returns a cloned
input geometry when called with 0 as distance (needs CVS sync - finally
committed).

This behaviour is correct.  Buffer is defined to always return a polygon.  Thus the 0-width buffer of a LineString is indeed the empty GeometryCollection.

Message-ID: <5A94289A9268514C8D6C0F1FF44BA0271DFF6F@venus.VividSolutions.com>

Sandro's (sp?) buffer question points up a potential issue with ensuring that both JTS and GEOS continue to have identical semantics.  Any ideas for how to ensure this?

We do have the JTS Test Suite, but I'm not sure how well it's implemented in GEOS.  Also, it's not complete for spatial functions, and it certainly doesn't address non-Geometry methods.

We do have a set of JUnit tests for JTS; it might be worthwhile porting them to C++ and putting a framework in place to validate new builds of GEOS.

One difficulty with validating output of constructive functions is that the output may be topologically correct but not quite identical, due to vagaries of implementation and floating point.  I don't have a great solution for this right now - it would be worth discussing.

About the buffer semantics I don't think geos should behave differently
from JTS, we just tried to use it for debugging purposes. I'll change
it back to previous behaviour.

That's nice - did configure stop and this point? Maybe this is missing. 
It should stop and not create any makefiles.

If anyone has any insight into this I would appreciate some feedback.
Thanks in advance.

I am getting an indentical error on both redhat8 and solaris5.9 boxes when

either my part or the software on these machines.  With the redhat using
gcc 3.2, on the solaris gcc 3.3. see error below:

Did you run the ./autogen.sh script ?
It is needed for CVS builds.

This check is made by the AC_PROG_CXX macro.
It will give the CXX variable a value anyway defaulting
to 'g++' even if none has been found.

If anyone knows how to detect its failure and warn user about it
please tell me :)
