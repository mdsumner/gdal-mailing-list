G'day list.

Just a quick update on the GEOS PHP bindings. I took some time last
night to take a look at PHP 7 and did a quick migration to their new
API. I'm able to compile cleanly and some of the tests are running,
although I need to sort through the individual methods and clean up
some bits and pieces here and there. Most of the pain at this point
involves changes to the way PHP 7 manages memory and moving over to
new data types like zend_string where it makes sense. It's definitely
a decent start, even if it's a bit rough at the moment. Once I get
everything stabilized I'll look into abstracting some of the changes
away into some macros and the like so that both PHP 5 and 7 can
compile from the same code base, as right now I've torn things apart
for the sake of getting to know PHP 7 a bit better. The major hang up
at the moment is the new memory management system, as I'm experiencing
segfaults at process shutdown and with garbage collection, but it's
nothing that's insurmountable, just some basic refactoring and
rejiggering that's necessary. I'll have some more time available soon
to try and wrap up a first pass, after which the abstractions will
come in.

Cheers, list.

Thanks for the update, J
Let me know when you need some testing

 Probably a missing file in the vc build scripts,
 but nobody likes windows so nobody cares to maintain
 those scripts. If you send a patch, it could be applied.

 A git2cl tool exists and is packaged on debian, but as the current
 ChangeLog format includes revision numbers we'll need to drop that
 information for the new ChangeLog (no revision numbers in a git-only
 repo).

 One possibility here is to save the old ChangeLog files into a
 subdirectory (doc/changelog?) and start with a fresh one starting from
 where the old one ends.

 Another is to STOP checking the ChangeLog into the repository but always
 only generate it at "make dist" time, which may be a bit tricky to pass
 "make distcheck" (as it sets the sources read-only) but may set us free
 from future management issues.

 This is propedeutic for moving the codebase from SVN to git.

Comment:

 Another possibility is to stop replicating VCS log in the ChangeLog and
 not to include any revision info.

 Typically, ChangeLog is written, by humans for humans, as a
 chronologically ordered list of '''notable''' changes for each version of
 a project, but not all changes/revisions checked in to the repo. I like
 http://keepachangelog.com/

 The "notable changes" role is taken by the NEWS file.

Comment (by strk):

 So you agree with removing the ChangeLog file from the repository
 and only manually edit NEWS file (for human-edited "notable" changes) ?

 Then we can automatically generate and include the ChangeLog into
 official releases (which are downloaded w/out the whole git history)

 What do you think to put into the ChangeLog as revision 'number'?

 I rather meant, drop the idea of generating ChangeLog, rename NEWS to
 ChangeLog and let release manager (not individual committers) to update it
 manually.

As we move from SVN to GIT (sloowly, I know, sorry for that)
I started looking at options to get peer reviews w/out being
dependent on a git hosting service (like OSGeo's Gogs or
gitlab) and found this:

  https://github.com/google/git-appraise

It promises to support for distributed reviews, up to line-oriented 
comments, by placing reviews within the git repository (in a custom
ref).

For testing, I pushed a review request for GEOS to the Gogs mirror.
It should show up if you:

  $ git remote add osgeo https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/geos/geos
  $ git appraise pull osgeo
  $ git appraise list

Maybe the bots could pick review requests, test the build
for them and report the build status (thinking forward).

(I was going to send a private reply but List-Reply-To: considered
harmful. :-)

From a quick look, it seems the review data is somewhat awkward to type,
so that this would only really work with an editor plugin.  It seems
there is one for eclipse, but not for the far more important emacs and
vi.

Have you tried to do a real review, and with what editing tool?  How did
it work?

I tried, and pushed to gogs (https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/geos/geos)
If you "git appraise pull <gogs-remote-name>" you should then be
able to see it with "git appraise list".

IIRC I used the commandline, no editor.
A google guy just accepted a PR of mine, so maybe we can send
more, for an editor :)
