When OSM got rid of Trac, we moved the tickets to 
https://github.com/openstreetmap/trac-tickets rather than a simple HTML 
page. This gives search and stuff like that

Subject: [geos-devel] (Fewer) CI Tables
Message-ID: <79ED139F-F941-4ADB-9B1E-14E585DEDD12@cleverelephant.ca>

We've got big master CI tables on the trac, in the web site (that duplication will go away with RFC 10) and also in all the branch README files.

I'd like to propose stripping the README badges just down to the branch of interest (so main would have main badges only, 3.10 would have 3.10 badges only, etc), and keeping just the one master table in the web site. Seems silly to have a big master CI table in 3.9 that includes 3.8, 3.7, etc.

How stable is the web site?    It's handy to have a global overview of the
CI, but if the web site is often unavailable that's not gonna help.

Easier how ? What would be possible for new contributors which is not
possible today ?

> 	? Easier collaboration with downstream projects

Easier how ? What would be esier for us to do with downstream projects ?

> 	? Far easier story on ?how to we manage the project? and ?where the important things happen?

For "how we manage the project" I think this means "we use GitHub
issues" rather than "we use Trac milestones", right ? The only easier
story would be to use *one* system rather than two, for management,
which was the case before GitHub issues were enabled.

> 	? Far less dependence on individual contributors for infrastructure work that only they can do

More dependence on single corporation being the only one which can do
work on the infrastructure. Anyone can be a contributor on OSGeo
infrastructure so "only they can do" is a misleading picture, as if
"they" would not be all of us...

I'll only vote after reading the full RFC as I'd like to understand
what the new management would look like. A feature I often use is
marking Trac tickets as blockers for a milestone (we only release when
all important issues are released), I'd like to understand how would
this work on github.

+1, it was like this some time ago.

To be honest I'd even completely REMOVE the badges
from the README as I think README files should be as
readable as possible on any device, and I often read
them from a console based pager (80 cols...)

GitLab has a great separate handling of badges, see
how it looks here:

It will come back once pramsey has reset the config.  It's really because gh-pages is a branch of our core github branch
and that is not mirrored.  This problem will be solved once GEOS moves to Github.

[Regina Obe] Yes it has, and we aren't going to get any more contributors than we have already because
a) We already have issues allowed to be made on Github. 
 One thing I would never agree to for PostGIS cause it just opens the flood gets for rando people to complain about how some piece doesn't work for them (whether it's packaging, I can't install, please help me do this, blah blah),
 because it's too much work to join a mailing list and complain there.

The other reason -- I like that when I do a google search for a bug the first entry that comes up has osgeo.org or postgis.net on it.
If PostGIS moved to github I'd get github.org/postgis which would just annoy me as hell "Why am I freely giving extra SEO juice to github"

b) We already accept pull requests

To the random contributor nothing has changed aside from we will only accept pull requests from Github.
But all contributors who we care about getting pull requests from already have an account on github so nothing lost here.

It won't be a wiki anymore, but it will be part of the core website, which honestly I do think is better.
So I'm fine with this.

I honestly don't even know why this is even worth the effort.  Sounds like a lot of busy work.
Having an geos-old-tickets I think would just cause confusion.  You really should just start from scratch and copy over anything you think worthy of copying over.  If no one bothers to copy it over then it really wasn't that important.

I'm fine with this.  I think Microsoft is a great steward and will be as long as there is marketing pressure for them to be.

That said -- I do worry a lot about the massive migration to Github.  
My main reason for worry (call it me being paranoid), is that eventually all open source projects will be forced to move to Github.
This means less pressure on Microsoft to be good, cause hey you have no choices.
This means people forgetting how to run their own infra, so you have no choices etc.
No need to work on making things like gitea or gitlab better, cause everyone is using Github anyway.

So everytime I hear "everyone is over here, follow us to the promised land", I loose my lunch.

Despite all my reservations, I'm still a -0 

Because though I disagree I know I don't do much work on GEOS so I don't want my vote to count
and it's the easiest way for Paul and the other core contributors to work.

The decision should be left up to the doers.

I think it would be regrettable if also GEOS went all-in for GitHub. In my opinion -- apart from sharing a skeptical view with Sandro and Regina regarding move everything to The One Corp -- in particular the Issue system of GH is way inferior to trac tickets.

MacPorts [1] has come up with a hybrid system, hooking up trac with GH, which I think works fine and may be considered as an alternative. This allows e.g. in-logging to trac with GH creds; allowing automatic closing of tickets on merging of connected PRs.

Correct, it will be the web site, with an 'edit on github' link on every page.

Easier in that they don't need to grok the "over here for this part, over there for that part" hybrid setup we currently have. I appreciate that the change to a complete GH doesn't unlock Rivers and Oceans of value, but it does make things incrementally more understandable for new users. "As, here's the we site, here's the docs, and here's the development."

>> 	? Easier collaboration with downstream projects

Simpler cross references between issues in different orgs/repos primarily. Again we aren't talking about Torrents of Value, but things being slightly nicer.

Yes, that's what it means. And one-GH-system is much better than one-Trac-system as 99% of devs have a GH login while 0.0001% of devs have an osgeo login. That friction is a real thing.

"GitHub won't be reliable enough for us" is a pretty slender branch to hang an argument from.

I haven't laid out a scheme, I'd presume to borrow one from another old-school project like GDAL or Proj and use that for our issue tags and issue tagging process. Maybe Even or someone could point us to what's the state of the art in their poject.

Really simple (but we don't use a lot blocker in GDAL or PROJ): you 
assign the ticket to the appropriate milestone, create a "Blocker" label 
and assign it to the ticket. And then you filter tickets by milestones 
and labels.

Something like 
https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Ablocker+milestone%3A3.5.0

 The release tarball now includes the `web` subdirectory, that really only
 belongs in the VCS.

 The `examples` & `tools` subdirectories are missing from the tarball now.

Wow, this is badly tested. Looking forward to 3.10.2.

If you're unsure about the changes, you should publish a pre-release first.

Comment (by Mike Taves):

 correction to current "safest way" is:
 {{{
 sdist_dir=$(mktemp -d)
 cd $sdist_dir
 git clone --depth 1 --branch 3.10
 https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos.git
 cd geos
 # edit Version.txt
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake -G"Unix Makefiles" ..
 make dist
 # copy or upload .tar.bz2 file somewhere
 cd /tmp
 rm -rf $sdist_dir
 }}}
 I still think a better long-term solution would be to make a POSIX script
 that uses git-archive. This should be targeted for a future release, and
 I'll have a think about it as I would also want it for PROJ too.

Tagging or announcing is irrelevant, it's published in the regular 
location on download.osgeo.org which is monitored for new releases by 
the Debian package.

Don't put trials there, and if you do, use a pre-release so everyone 
knows it's not a regular release.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Things have been broken recently. Broken in a way that hampers activity in a project that doesn?t see tons of it. Certs have needed updating, docker containers aren?t running, ci is not connected, etc. What points where and how it all currently works is super confusing, especially to an outsider. It?s been in a state of flux and there?s no way to self-service it if all you want to do is make commits, get them tested, and close tickets. To say that ?anyone? can be a contributor and go stick their arm up the cow and fix it is all well and fine, but in practicality, that?s not true. Only you and Regina know. You aren?t always available, and you shouldn?t have to be either.

Doing the expected thing can provide lots of value. GitHub in 2021 is the expected thing, but GEOS doesn?t do it. It uses the project infrastructure that you and Regina want, and when we wish to move to something expected, we are told we are not volunteering hard enough to fix up the infrastructure you want for political reasons that have nothing to do with the daily activity of making commits, passing tests, and closing GEOS tickets. That GEOS exists and is used everywhere is enough of a political act we have all supported. We don?t need to burden the project with another set of flags that must be waived.

Not all of the developers have the contempt for the unwashed masses that you do. The only way a project grows new contributors is to provide a path for them. GEOS using GitHub, which they?re already familiar with, means they won't start at a very bespoke bottom. 

We?ve done it your way for quite a while, and after doing so, we?re asking for GitHub. If GitHub?s so terrible, we can migrate away to something else.

Agree to disagree. My release process is not defined by your automation.

Comment (by Mike Taves):

 Now identical to the updated 3.10 branch, but the new
 `CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES` setting is too aggressive and appears to
 exclude template files, and the source does not get past the
 configuration:
 {{{
 $ cmake ..
 ...
 CMake Error: File /tmp/from_trac/geos-3.10.1/include/geos/version.h.in
 does not exist.
 CMake Error at include/CMakeLists.txt:30 (configure_file):
   configure_file Problem configuring file
 ...
 CMake Error: File /tmp/from_trac/geos-3.10.1/tools/geos-config.in does not
 exist.
 CMake Error at tools/CMakeLists.txt:25 (configure_file):
   configure_file Problem configuring file
 Call Stack (most recent call first):
   tools/CMakeLists.txt:65 (configure_install_geos_config)
 }}}
 do the new `CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES` patterns need `$` to prevent
 partial matches or something?

 That looks like it should do!

 Also, be aware that download links should use

You mean gh-pages branch is *created* by github on github, and
our mirroring *deletes* it ? Because our mirroring is pushing
commits so the code on github which generates the gh-pages
branch should actually re-create it every time ?

Please no, I'd be -1 on this. We want to still allow contributions to
come from any source (including patches sent on mailing list)

The mirror was pushing the empty branch a lot of a while, maybe it's deleting it now. It's not super important to spend any time on fixing it IMO, if we're going to GH anyways.

Let's just say we'll take contributions whereever, like now, but honestly, we take what we see, so it's a little disingenuous to say "sure, we take contribs at all these 5 places!"). So I take GH and Trac and email. I don' t ever look at gitea or gitlab mirrors so they aren't a great place to put things if you want me personally to pick them up. I'd love to get my list down to just GH and email (which, turning on issue watching, I can collapse right down to just email).

That's why I care about Trac. I'd like to ONLY look in trac, you file
your ticket and say in a comment WHERE your patch/PR is.

This was the policy before issues on GitHub were enabled.

You already receive emails when a trac ticket is opened, right ?
You probably also already receive emails when a github pull request is
opened or a gitlab pull request is opened or a gitea one is.

Sorry, so what's your problem with GH-only that you're willing to light yourself on fire over then?

I'd like (as the RFC notes) to have one place for things. All the things. I'd like that place to be the place where the developers are. All the developers. This is my position, nothing complex, nothing fancy.

+1. Fedora also does that. Version numbers are cheap. 3.10.2 would be
way better.

Which are the parts you are thinking about ?
Software components or pull-requests vs. issues ?

At the moment for GEOS itself (the library component) there's
a two-parts situation due to the fact that we didn't want to
ditch Trac in order to retain the commit<->issue links, like
this one from 13 years ago:

  https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos/commit/9f42184aef30c34f9dd254d0fbb9705df418b048

See how you go easily from commit hash to ticket and back.

How do you plan to deal with those references ?

For the software components we currently have 4 public
repositories and 2 private ones listed on the Gitea organization
page, would you also want to move all of them to GitHub ?

I don't. Perhaps the folks from proj or gdal could provide their experience with moving along and not necessarily retaining every scrap of history?

I can't see the private ones, but of the ones I see, 'geos', 'geos-docker' and 'php-geos' (not sure if that's defunct?).

I'm not willing to light myself on fire :)

My problem with GH-only is the loss of history: we'll be browsing
commits and finding links to still unexistent or completely unrelated
issues, unless there's a plan to deal with that.

Gitea is handling that correctly at the moment.

> I'd like (as the RFC notes) to have one place for things. All the things.

Gitea would satisfy these characteristics, right ?
Uhm... wrong (this mailing list is not there)

> I'd like that place to be the place where the developers are. All the developers.

This is a scary thought.

> This is my position, nothing complex, nothing fancy.

My vote will be -0 as I still belive in do-ocracy but please find
a solution to the problem of cross-referencing commits to tickets
as I think that has a value.

Are you logged in ? Private repositories can only be seen
by people who have access to them.

The public ones are:

  - geos
  - geos-docker (docker images used for CI)
  - php-geos (php bindings, pretty defunct, despite its mirror
              being on github).
  - website (useless by now, contains a snapshot of the
             website from 2007)

The private ones contain the code used for the mirrors

Thanks for the suggestion Nicklas.
We also have an hybrod system, but we never enabled
the ability to log into Trac or Gitea with GitHub
credentials (technically possible) to reduce attack
surfaces.

Automatic closing of tickets is currently implemented
by Gitea parsing git commit logs ("Closes #xxx" with "xxx"
beign a trac ticket number).

Having pull requests automatically open tickets could
be useful but sounds complex (the script would need
to tell if a ticket already exists, to avoid duplication)

I spent a few minutes setting up the website on our own infra,
so now the RFC can be read here:
https://geos.osgeo.org/web/development/rfcs/rfc10/

That website should now be updated everytime a commit
is pushed to the "main" branch on git.osgeo.org.
I made it accessible under the /web subdir as experimental,
but moving it one dir above would be easy (current top-dir
redirects to trac.osgeo.org/geos instead).

The Gitea update setup is controlled here:
https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos/settings/hooks

The server-side script responding to the URL hit by the hook
was made by me manually (as experimental). It's a 4 lines script
updating a local clone of the git repository, tweaking a configuration
and running hugo. The host machine holding the script was configured
to run the script upon receiving a request on an URL (again this was
done manually but could be stabilized by using ansible to setup).

 Intersection between two polygons gives a wrong result.

 I encountered the problem when using spatialite, but reproduced using
 shapely as described in the following issue:
 https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely/issues/1216

 I also had a look using JTS TestBuilder and the problem can be reproduced
 there as well. Using the "old" intersection the result is correct, but
 when using the "OverlayNG" intersection the same problem appears.

Yes, please don't do this, or at least please don't be be put out if I next request you take it down. I don't want more bespoke scripts and hooks, I want fewer, that is (one of the) points of RFC10.

Well, I would like to have that too, but I'd like to move to GH and consolidate our web presence even more. I see no straightforward way to maintain the complex mix of interlinkages in the history, and I know that once we move those interlinkages will still be there for everything going forward. My compromise, which is in the RFC is scraping the tickets so that it's possible to completely shut down the trac instance while still retaining the historical ticket contents, if not the perfect interlinkage.

(cross-posted from Matrix on request)

I've been hesitant to add a voice into the fray, but perhaps now is a good
time. One of the many wonders of getting to build things on top of GEOS is
getting to stand on the shoulders of giants. Giants who sometimes have
giant opinions, but have also put in giant efforts to get us here. And for
that I thank everyone who has helped make GEOS so, especially those that
have gone out of their way to make sure that the project stays alive, the
commits flow to the right places, the bots hum along happily, and the
stability and feature set of the library upon which we build gets even
better. *You people are amazing.*

Perhaps useful here though is the view of a newcomer to the project.
Granted, my contributions to date are extremely minimal, but perhaps my
experience more broadly representative of the experience of other newcomers?

At first, it took me a while to even figure out how to interact with the
project. There's a GH repo. There's Trac. There's a mailing list. There's a
maze of documentation on how to get started, set up your environment, etc,
of various vintages, so no guarantee that the instructions will work the
first time. Jumping into the project, I wanted to be polite, I wanted to be
respectful of everyone's valuable time: where is the primary place I should
submit a bug report? Where should I submit PRs, given that there appear to
be multiple primary repos? Why do I have to create an OSGeo account, with a
custom pledge to do no ill? When is it appropriate to open a GH issue vs a
Trac report vs ask on mailing list vs ask on Matrix? Long story short,
there was a lot of friction and a path that was not clear from the outset,
and a degree of gatekeeping that might intimidate those less intent on
jumping in.

Note: this isn't intended to spur a debate about when/how/if there should
be gatekeeping, or the relative merits of each part of the above puzzle.
There are surely well-thought out reasons for each part that led to the
above, but the outcome is that to an outsider, it is still a puzzle.

I fully support the idea of centralizing on GH, with a clear intent on
reducing that friction both for contributors as well as maintainers. I was
really excited about this potential for RFC 10. It's always about
tradeoffs, and some things shouldn't be compared on feature sets alone.
It's a temporary home (so auto backups are a good idea) until the next
better thing, but better to have one home for a while than a bunch of homes
patched together in ways that are not obvious and brittle to maintain.

My experience interacting with the project on GH has been great. People
were kind, thoughtful, and helpful in commenting on my PRs. In a supporting
role, it was really helpful to be able to ask questions on Matrix, just to
try and understand how things should work. I felt like GEOS maintainers
went out of their way to help me - and other newcomers - be successful once
we had passed through the gates to start interacting with the project. Like
I said, you folks are amazing. So I was always a bit baffled by why it
seemed hard to get to this point. When you are already in, it is altogether
too easy to forget what it took to get here.

Relative merits aside, GH is where a lot of this is happening. It's easier
because it is expected, and the roles, workflow, etc are more clear to a
wider variety of folks. No accounts to setup in other systems, no confusion
about where to submit issues or PRs. It's easy to dismiss the friction of
getting involved compared to the substantive challenges of actually
contributing to the library (how do I get CMake to work? What is the right
pointer-thingy to use here in C++? Did I remember to free it in the right
place so things don't crash?), but it seems to me that anytime there is a
chance to reduce friction and barriers, that can only help the project move
forward a little bit faster, a little bit better.

And so I hope my comments here help affirm that this seems a reasonable
consolidation, but doesn't come across as dismissive of the tremendous
efforts to build all the interconnected pieces that sustained the project
until now.

Wherewith a set of steps to take on the way to completing RFC10

- Ensure all current committers are part of a new committer group on github
- Turn off replication osgeo->github. Document new canonical location
in all places one can find (trac, website, etc)
- Complete migration of all current and useful content from the wiki
into the web site.
- Delete wiki content and replace front page with reference to new web
site location (libgeos.org)
- Set trac to read-only
- Scrape trac contents for posterity

Anything I am missing here?

[Regina Obe] 
I think the only thing missing on your list is:

302 Redirect geos.osgeo.org -> libgeos.org
It's the first entry that comes up for me in websearch (google) when I type
"geos" so I think it's important to redirect (weird that google doesn't
think trac is important)
On bing - it's trac.osgeo.org/geos (so guess we are set there)
On duckduckgo -- (first GEOS related link is trac.osgeo.org/geos)


I think the only thing that were on geos.osgeo.org was:
1)  a the redirect to trac (no longer needed)
2) doxygen (now on libgeos.org)
3) 7 day daily snapshots -- which we can probably do without


Thanks,
Regina

On the GitHub repo, modify the "About" description using the Web
interface (https://stackoverflow.com/a/21649064/).

Currently gitea has: Official GEOS git repository http://geos.osgeo.org
And GitHub has: Geometry Engine, Open Source [MIRROR]

A suggested "About" would be the same as the first line from README.md:
> GEOS is a C++11 library for performing operations on two-dimensional vector geometries

(or without "C++11", as that's a distraction for C API users)

As long as nobody pushes anything to Gitea there will be no mirror
occurring, but will secure the URL so even if hit will not do any
mirroring.

I've now also updated the mirroring script to fetch from github
and push to gitlab/gitea mirrors with this (also in production):
https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/repository-sync-scripts/commit/eeda522a3fb379f017cf5fe2edd05ccd21a05bff

It may be nice to setup a webhook to make the new official git repo
(github) ping the mirrorer script URL to update the old (gitlab)
and new (gitea) mirrors. Can you please do that ? (our way was using git
hooks, but we don't have access to the git repo on github so it will
need to be done in some other way).

With this commit I've removed the PING to the mirroring script from
the git hook which was installed in Gitea.
https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos-git-hooks/commit/9e093650ac954be8420cbe8f3d1fc38603f2abb3

Looking at that hook, another 2 things which are done upon receiving
a commit (which for example would happen if the repository is turned
into a mirror) are:

  - Send a mail to geos-commit mailing list with a diff of changes
    https://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/geos-commits

  - Notify Trac about the change

I guess we would want to STOP notifying Trac as well, as it's going to
turn to read-only, but the mailing list post might still be useful,
unless GitHub has support to do that, does it ?

REMINDER: go into your local git repo and if you're a big user of 'origin' as a remote name, you probably want to flip that over to GitHub now.

Message-ID: <A3604C29-6C62-4056-B365-D890D4616525@cleverelephant.ca>

So everyone knows what I'm up to:

Part of RFC 10 is deprecating the trac wiki as a source of material, and as a distraction from the main web presence at libgeos.org. My plan for this is to just work through the content I can find on the wiki, copying over pieces that are relevant and then deleting them from the wiki. The pieces which aren't really pertinent anymore (proposals for features we've already implemented, like MakeValid, etc) I'll just delete. My goal is to reduce the trac wiki main page to a single link to libgeos.org.

All the links out there pointing to the wiki will break.
How about leaving the wiki there, in read-only mode, with
just an header in each page mentioning it's just there
for historical reason, and giving a link to the new location
where things are ?

Subject: [geos-devel] Issue references in git history
Message-ID: <20211111232616.GB26910@c19>

Now that we're officially on GitHub we need a way to deal
with issue references in the git repository commit history.

All the issue references we have are in the form '#xxx' with
'xxx' being a number and referring to a trac ticket.

As we are NOT planning to rebuild the GitHub repository to
have a 1:1 mapping of Trac tickets to GitHub issues we're
left with the problem of GitHub source browser turning those
references into links to unexisting or completely unrelated
GitHub issues.

The GitLab and Gitea mirrors support "external issue trackers"
so can be configured to still point at Trac, but if in the future
we are going to still use '#xxx' to refer to *github* tickets
we're doomed to never have a way to fully qualify them.

For the mirrors I decided to point them at a CGI script I wrote
which gives two links: one toward github and one toward trac,
and in case only one of the two pages exist, redirect him there.
You can see how it works by following the ticket reference from
these pages:

    https://gitlab.com/geos/libgeos/-/commit/2a8d88202d0a4d124d1ff15b699d9e6b95e1563f
    https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos/commit/2a8d88202d0a4d124d1ff15b699d9e6b95e1563f

It's not the best solution, but still helps the user finding
her way to the actual ticket being referenced.

For GitHub it will still be a problem. How can we solve that ?
According to
https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls
GitHub also understands the `GH-xxx` syntax to refer to GitHub
issues/pull-requests, did anyone test this ? Could a policy be
to use these different syntax to refer to GitHub ?

I've just tested this and it seems to work:

[Regina Obe] 

I'm all for prefixing the new tickets with GH-
That will also solve the convergence issue of new GH tickets having the old
numbers of old trac tickets.

Does Gitlab and Gitea have a mechanism to make sense of GH-xxx?

Right, although it will still NOT solve the problem of old
'#xxxx' references pointing (when rendered by GitHub) to the
wrong place. This one we can not do anything about, unless we
decide to also *pay* GitHub (it looks like they have that feature
but has a cost, same as GitLab).

> Does Gitlab and Gitea have a mechanism to make sense of GH-xxx?

Somewhat.

GitLab recognizes them but when pointing to the "external issue
tracker" it strips the label and only sends the number, so we
have no way (in our script) to tell what the original reference
form was. Like GitHub GitLab also has a feature to behave differently
based on the label but is a proprietary component.

Gitea can be configured to recognize *either* `<prefix>-<number>`
or `#<number>` but not BOTH at the same time. When recognizing the
first form it will send, to the external tracker, all the information
(including prefix) so the external tracker (for example my script)
could decide what to do based on the prefix. I filed an issue to
improve this: https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/17621
and if we wanted, we could give the money to a Gitea developer rather
than to GitHub (or GitLab), so the results will still be in the open.

This was done with this change to the git hook on Gitea:

For the release steps, can you also add:

     - generate a release on GitHub (this way all of those 'following' 
this repository are automatically notified of the release)
     - for example, see: 
https://github.com/MapServer/MapServer/releases/tag/rel-7-6-4
     - specifically:
         click the button "Draft a new release" at : 
https://github.com/libgeos/geos/releases

thanks!

If you're not into clicking a button, it can also be done auto-magically 
through a GitHub action: https://github.com/actions/create-release

Comment (by caspervdw):

 This specific issue has been solved in
 https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/485

 However there are some situations remaining where a FP ?invalid? flag is
 set:

 - binary predicates on empty geometries
 - voronoi_polygons on a point
 - hausdorff_distance sets an invalid flag (in our seemingly normal test)
 - offset_curve on an empty linestring

 All through the CAPI. See pygeos https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/pull/441
 for the specific tests where I encountered the FP ?invalid? flags.
