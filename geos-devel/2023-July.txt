For this small fix with MSVC noise...

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/936

It's still quite an old release, my dev env sits at 3.24 for example.

This should be fine for most platforms (e.g.) https://pkgs.org/search/?q=cmake

I don't see a problem with requiring 3.15, but the issue isn't very clear
to me. Is our CMake configuration using some feature of 3.15 while
declaring that we only require 3.13?

FWIW Debian Buster I think ships with cmake 3.13 and it?s not that old.  Old but not that old.

 

-1  to increase the cmake version until the pressing reason can be better explained or there are more pressing reasons.

 

As I recall I think Amazon had to upgrade their CMake to build the latest GEOS.

 

Note Debian Buster ships with 3.13 (which is old but not that old).

I also just approved this run of this pull request, and it broke some of our bots like the Ubuntu 20.04, which is kind of in the same boat as Debian Buster, old but not that old. Okay maybe in year when it?s time to release we can consider it ancient.

 

What I am curious to understand is why our VS windows 2022 build running cmake 3.26.4  https://github.com/libgeos/geos/actions/runs/5446890161/jobs/9908248625

 

Seems to be doing just fine without this patch am I missing something here?  What is different about this pull request error. 

What version of VS is this using?

 

Thanks,

Regina

Hi all, please disregard the pull request, I have closed it, it is 
easier for me to make the change locally.   This way it doesn't affect 
your builds.

Subject: [geos-devel] Backport Intersection robustness fix (GH-937)?
Message-ID: <CAK2ens3T4BPNzg8h20v-xefSKiaqLQPpo-nAyvB_mtqYTufj8A@mail.gmail.com>

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/937 switches to using DoubleDouble
computation for line intersection.  This improves the accuracy of
calculating line intersection points.

This fixes some egregious bugs in spatial predicate evaluation (e.g.
https://github.com/libgeos/geos/issues/933 and
https://github.com/locationtech/jts/issues/396).

However, It does change some overlay results.  This may cause some failures
in downstream integration tests.

Is there any objection to backporting this fix to older versions (i.e. 3.12
and possibly further back?)
