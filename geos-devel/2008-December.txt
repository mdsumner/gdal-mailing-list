Hi Regina,

Thanks for giving it a try and finding this.  I forgot to add the
changes in the root directory.  I didn't think to make a patch because
of the new files I was adding.  This time I went ahead and did an svn
add just to be able to take a good patch.

And yes, this was done in Trunk and not a branch.

I've attached the new patch file to the ticket.

Thanks again,
Chuck

Chuck,

Thanks.  I applied the patch and tried compiling under VC2005 and there
is still an issue. 

I think the geos\trunk\build\msvc80\geos_c_dll\geos_c_dll.vcproj

and 

trunk\build\msvc80\geos_lib\geos_lib.vcproj 

need to be changed accordingly.

Even after fixing this - still doesn't compile under my msvc80
environment.  There is another problem, which I think has to do with
Paul's last change which didn't give me a problem under OpenSUSE but
causes an error when compiling under VC2005.

Also I am noticing that the trunk\msvc80 is trying to create some files
in C:\Development\msys

I think this was corrected in 3.0 branch with last patch since I didn't
see the same flaw there.

Anyrate as soon as your patch is committed and Paul fixes the other
issue, I'd be happy to submit my patch for the msvc80 folder.

-- To Paul,
-- The error I am getting under VC2005
Error	415	error C2440: 'return' : cannot convert from 'char' to
'char *'	
geos\trunk\capi\geos_c.cpp	169

Haven't tested with the plain makefile.vc or under mingw yet.

Thanks,
Regina

Hey folks,

Bit of a cross-post, but this has shown up in a couple of places now across
a few people, so I thought i'd fish for ideas here too...

GeoDjango (http://geodjango.org) has python+ctypes wrappers around the C
interface for GEOS. Under Apache 2.2.9 (eg. Ubuntu Intrepid), mod-python and
mod-wsgi reproducibly segfault when interacting with GEOS geometries. The
same code works fine under the python shell or via fastcgi, as does other
ctypes code.

modwsgi list: Segfault under modwsgi but not shell
http://groups.google.co.nz/group/modwsgi/browse_thread/thread/a488d2551c4c7df0

django-users list:  GeoDjango in Ubuntu 8.10, Segmentation Fault
http://groups.google.com/group/django-users/browse_frm/thread/e337057e9df9bb9

I'd appreciate any insight anyone can offer.

Thanks,

Rob :)

Sounds like it may be. A user on the modwsgi list reported that it doesn't
occur on his 32 bit system.

It's fun that Shapely and Django get to find and fix the same bugs in two
different code bases.

Message-ID: <200812031505.41792.gregor.fikoczek@wheregroup.com>



Hi list, 

i am a "newbie" in Solaris and trying to compile geos-3.0.3 in Solaris 10 
(x86):

bash-3.00# cd geos-3.0.3
bash-3.00# export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib
bash-3.00# env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin ./configure
bash-3.00# env PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/ccs/bin make

But I'm getting always the error:

rminant.o .libs/SIRtreePointInRing.o .libs/SimplePointInAreaLocator.o .libs/SimplePointInRing.o
make[2]: *** [libalgorithm.la] Error 1
make[2]: Leaving directory `/Documents/Download/geos-3.0.3/source/algorithm'
make[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1
make[1]: Leaving directory `/Documents/Download/geos-3.0.3/source'
make: *** [all-recursive] Error 1

After executing the Patch 
http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/attachment/ticket/205/geos-solaris-1.diff 
(http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/205)
i still get the same error. 

I also tried with the geos-trunk sources(gdal-3.1.0) and get an other error:
false

Am doing something wrong ? Are there any Options i have to set by 'make' ?

The 2009 Toronto Code Sprint is now set for March 7-10 at the Bond
Place Hotel in Toronto, Canada.

  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Toronto_Code_Sprint_2009

We hope you will consider joining us for a worthy weekend of sprinting
and getting connected.

We are now looking for sponsors to cover venue and lunches during the
sprint. If your organization wants to curry favor with a couple dozen
influential geospatial programmers, this is a great chance. We are
looking for just four sponsors at $500 each, please get in touch with
me if you are interested in sponsoring this event.

Thanks!

 This was submitted to PostGIS -- and we have confirmed this to be an issue
 in 3.0.3 and 3.1.0 SVN of GEOS with newer installs of PostGIS and believe
 its a GEOS bug and not a PostGIS one. Refer to
 http://code.google.com/p/postgis/issues/detail?id=81

 What steps will reproduce the problem?
 1. Run the attached script
 2.
 3.

 What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

 server closed the connection unexpectedly
         This probably means the server terminated abnormally
         before or while processing the request.
 connection to server was lost


 What version of the product are you using? On what operating system?

With Dale vote we're up to 4. 
I get Matz and Gary otes are still missing ?

/me wonders how useful PSCs are to free software advancement,

Hello all,

Just wanted to find out if there is anything more that needs to be done?

I don't want to send this into the aether and then walk away. :) I'd
love to see this included in the next release version so if there's
anything I can do to help ensure this....

Thanks,
Chuck

I want to see it in the next release too (since I don't want to see it
in the release after that...) so...

* I hope a couple downstream users of GEOS could apply the patch and
see if everything still works for them
* Could someone step up and commit to an actual review of the patch itself?
* Said someone can then apply it, hopefully after a couple positive
downstream reviews

Er, if it's not clear what I mean by "downstream" it's apps that use
the current CAPI, PostGIS, Shapely, GDAL, etc.

Subject: [geos-devel] Compiling GEOS for ARM processor
Message-ID: <49465914.4060609@free.fr>

Hello,

I am trying to compile geos-3.0.3 for the ARM architecture. I am using
GCC 4.2.1 and GLIBC 2.5, the toolchain can be freely downloaded at
<http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/portal/release313>.

I have used the following commands :

./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/home/jcr/arm-2007q3
make

All the files are compiled, but there is a problem with linking :

Any idea ?

I attempted to apply and build the patch, but the geosTS_c.h file
wasn't generated, even though I ran ./autogen.sh and ./configure. I'm
trying to figure why, but it's not clear so far.

Some early notes:

- Anal rententive me is not enthused by geosTS_c.h, namewise.  geos_ts_c.h?
- Also not glad to see the test programs in the midst of the other
stuff. Subdir it?

Reading through geosTS_c.h,

- The header information hasn't been updated to reflect authorship.
- The version number defines duplicate the info in geos_c.h, and
double the maintenance overhead (there's some number hardcoded there
because of stoopid MSVCC). A shared version header than both files can
include would be better.
- In fact there's gobs of code that is duplicated across both
headers... I really worry about that. This takes "maintaining two
APIs" to unnecessary heights, I feel.
- Can we just drop the _r methods into the same .h file? (This is a
question, not a request, I may be forgetting some aspect of the
original discussion that answers my question.)

The answer is that geosTS_c.h to configure.in under the line for
geos_c.h in configure.in
Note that the later questions on the code dupes in geosTS_c.h might
make this unnecessary.

No, really, in ./tests would be best. To answer myself.

With the build problems removed, I can build PostGIS against this
patched GEOS, and the PostGIS regressions all pass still, so there's
no functional show-stoppers, just the two build issues and the
aesthetics of how the code is currently laid out.

Great news on functionality.

Will act on the build and aesthetics and post a new patch.

Thanks for the review/test and comments.

 I am trying to compile geos-3.0.3 for the ARM architecture. I am using
 GCC 4.2.1 and GLIBC 2.5, the toolchain can be freely downloaded at
 [http://www.codesourcery.com/gnu_toolchains/arm/portal/release313].

 I have used the following commands :

 {{{
 ./configure --host=arm-none-linux-gnueabi --prefix=/home/jcr/arm-2007q3
 make

 All the files are compiled, but there is a problem with linking :

Got the other comments worked out but I have a couple questions about
moving the test programs.

1) The original test program, geostest.c has been there all along.  The
new ones I added were copies of geostest.c.  Should everything be moved?

2) Where in the tests directory should they go? They aren't currently
part of the unit testing.

Thanks,
Chuck

I would hazard tests/capi

Other thoughts?

Just wanted to be sure since all that is compiled into the unit test
executable.  I don't think these tests go into the unit test tool but I
have no problem putting them there and compiling into the separate tools
if there are no objections.

Yes, separate tools, not part of the unit suite.

Hi all,

I've changed the patch based on Paul's comments.

-- combined the two header files for easy maintenance. (This 'fixed' the
configure error by getting rid of the thread safe header.)
-- fixed the char * error.
-- changed the .c from geosTS_c.cpp to geos_ts_c.cpp
-- moved the test executables to tests/unit/capi directory.  This seemed
to cause patch a bit of problems so I created a little script that does
the svn move before applying the patch.

All this is in a new 2.0 tar file attached to the ticket.

Thanks again for the testing and comments Paul.

Chuck

Subject: [geos-devel] Minimum Bounding Circle
Message-ID: <53F9CF533E1AA14EA1F8C5C08ABC08D204D7F0DB@ZDND.DND.boston.cob>

I was snooping around the GEOS library and noticed a curious algorithm class
called MinimumDiameter.  As far as I can tell from scanning the code,
it seems similar in concept to the the Minimum Bounding Circle plpgsql algorithm that
Bruce posted in November

http://postgis.refractions.net/pipermail/postgis-users/2008-October/021734.html

Just wondering why this is not exposed in the CAPI interface or does it server an entirely different purpose from what I am thinking.

Thanks,
Regina

Yes, this is computing the same thing as the Minimum Bounding Circle 
algorithm.  This algorithm appeared in JTS for some reason which is lost 
in the mists of time.  AFAIK it's never really been used or tested 
extensively. 

It probably postdated the initial port of GEOS, and I guess nobody went 
looking for it until now...

I just looked at MinimumDiameter.cpp and the code does the same thing as 
the first part of my code linked by Regina.  This would be nice to have 
except for one thing - it may not work.  It calls distancePerpendicular 
which I couldn't find.  If this finds the point furthest from the 
/extended/ line segment and uses this to compute the diameter it is the 
same method as I used - rotate the geometry so the segment is horizontal 
and compute the bounding box.  I can provide you with a geometry where 
this algorithm fails.  Lee Meilleur can also provide a counter example.  
Because of this I changed my code to test every point pair for the 
Minimum Diameter.
