Hi,

We are developing a Solaris10 based product which make use of GEOS 2.2.2, we
compiled it under GCC4, but the performance is not so good comparing to
another solution which does not make use of GEOS. But as some SUN's engineer
said, the performance of Sun Studio compiled applications is tens of
times better than GCC compiled apps on SPARC, so we want to take

another shot on GEOS to try if it is better than the other solution if
we compile it with Sun Studio 10. Now
we met some problem compiling it with SUN Studio10,
I have searched the list archive for a "official" list of supported
compilers but failed, so would anybody please give such a list, so that
we can decide if it is applicable to compile it with Sun Studio10?

Thanks!

Ryan

Subject: [geos-devel] Polygonize produces wrong results
Message-ID: <23778086.3381178866357388.JavaMail.root@srsofaioi11506.ktso.ch>

I try to use the polygonize function with PostGIS and ogr2ogr Interlis driver. In both cases geos 3.0.0RC4 may produce wrong results. Take a look at the attached images. 
 
The image lines.png shows the initial situation. Many lines which represent 3 polygons. 
The result of running polygonize shows the image result_polygon.png. 
 
To reproduce this behaviour I attach the example line_test_small.zip geometry as shape-file. 
 
The problem seems to be the very close postitioned vertex points at the two resolved curved features. When I reduce the number of these vertex points to half of numbers the polygonize process will finish successful. Try it out. It looks like a rounding problem?? 
 
My system 
GCC-3.4.4 
GEOS-3.0.0RC4 
RedHat AS4 
PostGIS 1.1.6

Subject: [geos-devel] strange behaviour of LinearRing::within()
Message-ID: <200705111841.18950.marco.hugentobler@karto.baug.ethz.ch>

Dear geos developers,

I'm quite new to geos development, so I hope this is the right place for my 
(probably stupid beginer) question:

I have two linearRings and like to use the function within() with them. 
However, the results are strange. And if I create two polygons with the 
rings, the result of Polygon::within() is correct. This happens for me with 
both geos2.2.3 and geos-3.0.0rc4.tar.bz2. Probably I'm doing something wrong. 
Find below a simple example program.

Thanks for your help,
Marco

#include <geos.h>
#include <iostream>

/**Little program to test the within() function of geos*/
int main(void)
{
  geos::geom::GeometryFactory factory;

  std::vector<geos::geom::Geometry*> innerHoles; //no holes
  std::vector<geos::geom::Geometry*> outerHoles;

  //inner ring
  geos::geom::DefaultCoordinateSequence* innerSequence=new 
geos::geom::DefaultCoordinateSequence();
  innerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(1, 1));
  innerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(2, 1));
  innerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(2, 2));
  innerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(1, 1));
  geos::geom::LinearRing* innerRing = factory.createLinearRing(innerSequence);
  geos::geom::Polygon* innerPolygon = factory.createPolygon(innerRing, 
&innerHoles);

  //outer ring
  geos::geom::DefaultCoordinateSequence* outerSequence=new 
geos::geom::DefaultCoordinateSequence();
  outerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(0, 0));
  outerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(3, 0));
  outerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(3, 3));
  outerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(0, 3));
  outerSequence->add(geos::geom::Coordinate(0, 0));
  geos::geom::LinearRing* outerRing = factory.createLinearRing(outerSequence);
  geos::geom::Polygon* outerPolygon = factory.createPolygon(outerRing, 
&outerHoles);

  //if(innerPolygon->within(outerPolygon))
  if(innerRing->within(outerRing))
    {
      std::cout << "inner feature is within outer feature" << std::endl;
    }
  else
    {
      std::cout << "outer feature is within inner feature, something must be 
wrong" << std::endl;
    }

  return 0;
}

Ok, just in case someone else has this problem:

I compiled the sources on windows with Visual Studio 2005 using the provided
makefile for visual studio in the downloaded package. Afterwards i linked my
test application against the C++ static lib of geos which lead to the
problem described.

Then i tried this: I added all the source files to a new Visual Studio 2005
project and configured the include path. I rebuilded the static libs (for
debug and release version) with the new visual studio project and linked
against the new libs. Voila it worked (and i don't really know what the
problem was) !

(I have some other problems now...but i will start a new thread on that
topic cause i don't know if they are related to this thread or not)

Hi,

We're going to use geos to support Filter Encoding 1.0.0:

specification: http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=1171

schema: http://schemas.opengis.net/filter/1.0.0/filter.xsd)

...spatial predicate functions in MapServer
(http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/2105).

Since geos supports SFSQL, we know the following are supported by geos:

Equals
Disjoint
Touches
Within
Overlaps
Crosses
Intersects
Contains

Filter 1.0.0 also supports the following spatial predicate functions:

DWithin
Beyond
BBOX

BBOX is easy (and implemented) enough, but how about DWithin and Beyond?
Are these supported in any way from geos?

Any advice is much appreciated.

Thanks

..Tom

Tom,

I'm also interested in some info about internals of DWithin and Beyond
operations.
These both operations are supported by FDO (http://fdo.osgeo.org)
but unfortunately I've not found much information about their specification.

I also need to learn about it soon, so if I will find anything I let you
know.

Cheers

True.  The only info I found was from FES 1.0.0, section 8.2:

"The spatial operators DWithin and Beyond test whether the value of a
geometric property is within or beyond a specified distance of the
specified literal geometric value."

So both DWithin and Beyond take as inputs a geometry and distance value.

Right.

But I'd like to get more details, some math declarations or geometries
examples.
I asked on the FDO list about them:

Tom,

It seems these new spatial operators are based on Oracle features.
Here is longer explanation posted as a reply to my question, on the FDO
list:

Hope that helps.

Oliver,

Affine transformations are not implemented (yet), so there is no
rotation support in GEOS.
They are available in the original JTS package, but not in GEOS.
The only possibility I see now is to make some
implementation on your own.

Further info from Peter Vretanos (FES 1.0.0 spec editor):

"According to the BNF in the Cat 1.0 specification DWithin tests to see
whether geometry A is completely within a certain distance of geometry
B.

I interpret this to mean a "buffer" query.  That is you create a buffer
around A at the specified distance and then do a WITHIN (as defined in
SFSQL) between this new buffer-expanded geometry (A') and the test
geometry B.  If B is completely within A' then the operator evaluates to
true

BEYOND is the opposite of DWITHIN.   If B is completely outside of A'
then the operator evaluates to true." 

Cheers

Is this the Oracle defn also? I had always interpreted DWithin to  
mean "within distance of", so that

DWIthin(A,B,100) was functionally equivalent to Distance(A,B) < 100

OGC defines the DWithin and Beyond spatial operators recursively in

referenced by the WFS and WMS specs)

http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/filter

anybody feel like bringing up this confusion with the Open Geospatial

Hi,

Who does prepare release packages now?
I found that ie. 3.0.0rc4 does not compile with Visual C++.
There are missing files, makefiles are incomplete, etc.

I'd like to fix the process of making packages but I don't
know how does the process look like now.

Cheers

For GEOS, the idea is that you can run

  autogen.sh; ./configure ; make dist

and get a usable distro tarball out of that.
