Comment (by mdavis):

 After bisecting it appears (not surprisingly) that the cause of this bug
 is the commit:

 https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/8b433f0887633e320053e169e5bf71c5bbaecb1f

 Not sure why, however.  I suspect that there's an issue in the
 `QuadEdgeSubdivision::remove` method, since that is only called when there
 is a non-zero tolerance being used.

Comment (by mdavis):

 Found the fix for this.  See https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/342

 The problem is caused by two bugs in the `QuadEdgeSubdivision::remove`
 method:

 * Since the method argument can be an edge in either base or sym
 orientation, the code to remove the corresponding `QuadEdgeQuartet` needs
 to check if the quartet base matches the arg edge OR its sym
 * The lambda capture clause must specify the edge parameter as `e`, not
 `&e`, since it is already a reference

The switch has been flipped.
If you build GEOS without any options, you will get the OverlayNG engine
backing the standard geometry functions.

geom->union()
geom->intersection()
geom->symdifference()
geom->difference()
geom->unaryunion()

The unit and XML tests that differed from the old engine have been updated
to match the new NG outputs. That means if you use the --disable-overlayng
option in autotools or the DISABLE_OVERLAYNG option in cmake, not all tests
will pass anymore. NG is the new normal.

Comment (by mdavis):

 Replying to [comment:6 Paul Ramsey <pramsey@…>]:

 > Curiously, this case blows an exception on PostGIS, but not in the unit
 test.

 The reason the unit test passes is that the triangulation tolerance value
 (100) is larger than the extent of the input geometry.  This causes the
 data to collapse to a point, which produces an empty Voronoi diagram.  If
 a smaller tolerance (say 0.1) is used then the test fails with a Topo
 exception.

Comment (by mdavis):

 Using DD precision for circumcentre actually fixes this issue.  But the
 [https://github.com/libgeos/geos/blob/master/src/triangulate/quadedge/QuadEdgeSubdivision.cpp#L398
 isocelese triangle heuristic] for performance doesn't work. This is why
 the unit test fails when it is fixed to use an appropriate tolerance.

 Verified that the original data on this issue is fixed by using
 circumcentreDD (with no heuristic).

 Note that #976 is testing a subset of this data, which also fails:

Pleased to report that we now have added GitHub actions to our ever growing zoo of CI platforms.

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/actions

Makes getting a PR tested nice and quick. We also have the comprehasive, 50 million test matrix in Azure Pipelines, but I wanted to have something like our existing Travis set that would complete fairly fast and test both CMake and autotools builds. So the Azure Pipelines yaml provided a good starting point and I cut it back and matched up the tests to Travis more. All the jobs run in parallel and it's not queing up, as Travis seems to do more and more. 

Unfortunately, unlike Travis, GH Actions does not have any nifty architecture options like ARM, but maybe that will change shortly as ARM cloud stuff seems to be happening quickly.

Great, could you add that to the wiki as well ?

Also, since you're having fun with actions, can you see if there's
a way to attach an action to the "merge" green button, for having it
do something different (for a start: nothing, eventually: ping a web
url which will do the right thing).

> Unfortunately, unlike Travis, GH Actions does not have any nifty architecture options like ARM, but maybe that will change shortly as ARM cloud stuff seems to be happening quickly.

In case anyone missed it: Drone supports ARM since 2018, we may look
at using that:

Comment (by mdavis):

 I did run this against master as a C++ unit test (but didn't commit it
 because data is so large).  I can commit it if that seems like a good idea
 (there is a unit test which is a subset of this data though).

 Or, have been thinking about adding ability to run Delaunay and Voronoi as
 XML tests (should be fairly easy).

This strikes me as a big deal - any thoughts on calling the next release

It’s a big feature deal but I tend towards wanting to stick to semver...
not until we break backwards compatibility

Subject: [geos-devel] Port of PostGIS ST_Subdivide to GEOS / downstream
	libraries
Message-ID: <CAENuiqSh9MmqbQgxtUT3qpK66dTNk44fsV0RBrK1N4wqMpAHoA@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to expose functionality similar to ST_Subdivide (
https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Subdivide.html) in pygeos (ref:
https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/issues/244), which provides a Python
interface to GEOS.

The algorithm recursively subdivides input geometries along alternating x
vs y dimensions until a target number of vertices per geometry is
reached, which can greatly improve spatial index performance for complex
polygons (e.g., countries with coastlines).  Paul has written a very nice
overview of it here: http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2019/11/subdivide.html

Apologies if this has already been raised here; I was unable to find any
record of such a discussion in Github, Trac, mailing list archives.

I did not find a counterpart in JTS, so perhaps this is out of scope for
GEOS?

While we can take this on in a downstream library (and indeed may want to
pilot there first), this seems like it would have broader appeal to the
GEOS community if exposed via the C API.  There may also be potential
performance improvements to leveraging aspects of something like STRtree to
help identify x or y subdivision points (ideas not yet well developed
though).

Is there any interest in providing something similar within GEOS?  If so,
perhaps the next stage is to log this as a feature request to Trac.  I
anticipated the need for a little discussion around this topic, so I'm
raising here first.

Thanks,

BCW

Hi Brendan,

I don't remember it being discussed anywhere, but it's certainly been
floating around in my head for a while. I think it's very much worth
pursuing.

 Given an input polygon WKT: "POLYGON ((0 0, 0.1 0, 0.1 0.1, 0 0.1, 0 0))"
 and a gridSize of 1.

 With flags unset (0), this causes the polygon to collapse to an empty
 polygon (expected): "POLYGON EMPTY"

 With flags set to keep collapsed elements, the polygon is still collapsed
 to an empty polygon (unexpected).

 The expected output is "POLYGON ((0 0, 0 0, 0 0, 0 0, 0 0))".

 In contrast, a linear ring behaves as expected.  Given an input of
 "LINEARRING (0 0, 0.1 0, 0.1 0.1, 0 0.1, 0 0)":

 flag not set: "LINEARRING EMPTY"

Comment (by mdavis):

 The goal of GEOS operations is to always produce valid output.  A polygon
 with zero extent is invalid, so the closest valid result is `POLYGON
 EMPTY`.  Another way to put this is that if a polygon collapses completely
 due to rounding, it disappears rather than becoming a point.

 The collapsed LinearRing result is in fact also invalid.  So probably the
 current result  is out of spec, and should be changed to become
 `LINEARRING EMPTY`.  (In fact this should be the behaviour of the latest
 GEOS version incorporating OverlayNG).

 Generally speaking, GEOS operations require valid input.  For invalid
 input the result is usually undefined (or in some cases an error).

Comment (by Brendan Ward):

 It might be useful to clarify the intent of the flag to keep collapsed
 elements; it is not clear what collapsed elements should be retained,
 since their collapse implies that they are no longer toplogically valid.

 Decisions here also affect line strings as well.  Given an input of
 "LINESTRING (0 0, 0.1 0.1)" and gridSize of 1, with this flag set, it
 returns "LINESTRING (0 0, 0 0)", which is not valid (according to
 GEOSisValid_r).

 (have not tested on 3.9 / master)

#1074: Setting precision on some but not all geometries causes intersection
results to use the smallest nonzero gridSize
--------------------------+--------------------------
 Reporter:  Brendan Ward  |      Owner:  geos-devel@?
     Type:  defect        |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major         |  Milestone:
Component:  Default       |    Version:  3.8.0
 Severity:  Unassigned    |   Keywords:
--------------------------+--------------------------
 According to the comments in "geos_c.h.in" for GEOSGeom_setPrecision_r:
 "
  * Note that operations will always be performed in the precision
  * of the geometry with higher precision (smaller "gridSize").
  * That same precision will be attached to the operation outputs.
 "

 Given inputs:
 * "POLYGON ((0 0, 0 0.9, 0.9 0.9, 0.9 0, 0 0))"
 * "POLYGON ((0.75 0, 0.75 0.75, 1.75 0.75, 1.75 0, 0.75 0))"

 I then used GEOSGeom_setPrecision_r with a gridSize of 0.5 for the first
 geometry, which returns
 "POLYGON ((0 0, 0 1, 1 1, 1 0, 0 0))", and reports a gridSize of 0.5 via
 GEOSGeom_getPrecision_r.

 Performing an intersection via GEOSIntersection_r, I get back
 "POLYGON ((1 0.75, 1 0, 0.75 0, 0.75 0.75, 1 0.75))"
 which reports a gridSize of 0.5 (second geometry reports a gridSize of 0).

 If I then set a precision of 1 on the second geometry, which produces:
 "POLYGON ((1 0, 1 1, 2 1, 2 0, 1 0))" (second geometry then reports a
 gridSize of 1)

 I get back "LINESTRING (1 1, 1 0)" from intersection, which reports a
 gridSize of 0.5


 This may be expected behavior, but the comment in the code implies that
 the higher precision, in this case full precision as denoted by a gridSize
 of 0, would be used.  If so, perhaps the comment could be clarified to
 note something like:
 * if inputs both have nonzero gridSize, operations will be performed using
 the higher precision (smaller "gridSize").
 * if one but not all of the inputs have a nonzero gridSize, and others
 have a gridSize of 0, the smallest gridSize will be used.

Message-ID: <64EA0754-ECC2-4432-8CAE-FC3CDD609BA1@cleverelephant.ca>

Hey all, just truing up what's underway and nearly there...

- Am I right that Z coordinates are nearly done? What's the status there?

I've been trying to address some performance issues, with some success and some ... other things. 

The success is the SimpleSTRtree, which is just the current STRtree but without the inheritance structure and with the nodes stored all next to each other in contiguous memory for more locality. For at least one use case I've seen 20% speed-ups on overlays, using the SimpleSTRtree in place of the STRtree inside the MCIndexNoder. I have not seen any slow-downs. I have pushed the SimpleSTRtree into master.

While I have implemented the nearestNeighbor() functionality on the SimpleSTRtree, I haven't hooked it up to anything yet. It could go into the IndexedFacetDistance, if anyone is super enthusiastic about it. From there it would affect searching in PreparedGeometry of various sorts.

I also tried using a similar trick with the MonotoneChainBuilder that sits inside the MCIndexNoder, replacing individual heap allocations with slabs by putting objects onto a std::deque, and incidentally stripping out some book-keeping. While that seems to pick up about 3-5% speedwise, unfortunately something about my implementation is incorrect (and in a wonderfully subtle way) as it fails testing on some platforms (not mine). https://github.com/pramsey/geos/tree/monotone-chain-builder

I've put that work to the side for now.

All the performance talk is mostly because JTS still runs a lot faster than GEOS for some bulk processing. My current test is a big union of watershed boundaries, about 6MB of data, which takes about 20s under GEOS and about 25% of that under JTS.  It's a big gap, and in theory the two code bases are pretty aligned right now. Same overlayNG engine, etc. So I figure there has to be a big implementation ball of performance hiding under the covers somewhere. No luck thus far.

I think we're close, looking forward to release :)

You have your sample watershed data set.  Would like to test it out myself.

For the record: this is tracked by
https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/1070
which I marked as blocker for release

Is reported to be the only blocker for 3.9.0 (please mark any other
ticket as blocker for easier management):

Comment:

 Ran all these cases through PostGIS/GEOS 3.9 and they all processed
 without exceptions. Thanks for the sample data!

I'm going to say that the JTS Z work is functionally complete.  It
interpolates Z values where possible, and populates missing Z values from
an ElevationModel patterned after the one currently in GEOS.  I think GEOS
does interpolation along a line as well, but that seems questionable to me,
so have not implemented that.

So the final step is to finish porting the JTS code to GEOS, and then try
out the code in PostGIS. No idea how that will match up to the Z unit tests
in PostGIS - but I'm not sure they are based on any actual requirements
anyway?

That's quite a difference.  Maybe the JVM JIT really is magic?

Subject: [geos-devel] Drop SWIG bindings
Message-ID: <CAM2FmMruZuLc3FzABCB6ni87gft+jM4P9JrY51J6Zmac=XnwJQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

SWIG bindings have existed as part of the core GEOS library since
early development, however they have not received much attention in
many years.

I've (quickly) prepared two options for consideration:

Option one: Drop Python SWIG bindings
https://github.com/mwtoews/geos/pull/1

This keeps the SWIG interface for Ruby bindings, which is packed by
(e.g.) Ubuntu; see https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/ruby/ruby-geos
However, it drops the unsupported Python 2 SWIG bindings. Python users
can use either Shapely or PyGEOS.

Option two: Drop SWIG bindings, including for Ruby and Python
https://github.com/mwtoews/geos/pull/2

This drops the whole SWIG interface.
Note that Ruby users can access GEOS bindings via RGeo
https://github.com/rgeo/rgeo, which has a steady history of active
contributions; see https://github.com/rgeo/rgeo/graphs/contributors
Another idea is to move the SWIG Ruby bindings into a separate repo,
similar to php-geos https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/php-geos, however
this would require a volunteer to step in.

Any thoughts to either proposal? And if so, whether this should happen
before or after the next release?

+1 to Option two - Drop Python and Ruby SWIG.

I agree I think most Python users digest their GEOS via Shapely.  It's
better to have one very supported interface than confuse users with 2 one of
which is not maintained.

As far as Ruby -- I'll just take your word for It on that one.  I've never
used Ruby except for the asci doctor bit.

I union all these. It takes about 20s on my Air.

After collecting the inputs and writing to WKT:

\copy (select st_astext(st_collect(geom), 18) from wsa_vi) to
~/data/wsa.wkt;

I'm seeing 6 seconds in GEOS (not including WKT parsing)

bin/perf_unary ~/data/wsa.wkt union
# Reading geometries from /home/dan/data/wsa.wkt
# Read 1 geometries.
# 6,137,885 usec

vs 14s in JTS (including WKT parsing)

time bin/jtsop.sh -a ~/data/wsa.wkt -op Overlay.unaryUnion
# 14.43s user 0.47s system 202% cpu 7.354 total

Actually OverlayNGRobust.unaryUnion will compare the current OverlayNG code
to GEOS. However, OverlayNG is likely to be slower, in any case.

So:
GEOS - 6.1 s
JTS 14.4 s

That's an impressive difference in favour of GEOS.  I wonder why Paul's
timings are so different?

Because the ruby bindings had practically no users, they were dropped in
geos (3.8.0-1) and are no longer available in focal and later.

OMG, I wonder... I have a debug build of GEOS (because, you know, debugging). Is that it? Otherwise, are both tests (JTS and GEOS side) running through the OverlayNGRobust? I suppose I should ask: how do I run the JTS test? Then I can cut out the middleman and run them all myself?

Seems best to try a non-debug build...

To run in JTS you can use:

time bin/jtsop.sh -a ~/data/wsa.wkt -op OverlayNGRobust.unaryUnion

You should run off master for this (or a very recent pull)

Actually it's better to use

bin/jtsop.sh -time -a ~/data/wsa.wkt -op OverlayNGRobust.unaryUnion

That will time only the operation, excluding the I/O.

Well then, good news from me, since with a Release build, I can run that union in 4.7s in GEOS and 6.6s in JTS.
w00T!
Now I'm wondering if my other performance work, that yielded relatively little in Debug might be bigger winners in Release...

Excellent news for GEOS... but I'm a little sad for JTS.

Release FTW!

Comment:

 I guess one option here would be to pick the leftmost-upmost and the
 rightmost-bottommost points of a ring, split the ring in two parts, merge
 the lines which remain split by the origina vertex, then perform the
 simplification on the two parts and join them back togheter.

 What do you think Martin ?

 I don't see how that works.  The problem with the current simplification
 algorithm is that it is essentially working on a line, not a ring - which
 is why it doesn't remove the endpoint even if it should be.  Doesn't
 splitting the ring just introduce one more endpoint?

 Not sure of what a solution could be ATM.  The simplification algorithm
 being used is Douglas-Peucker, and I don't know if that can be generalized
 to work on true rings.

Comment (by mdavis):

 Not a net new problem; here's some
 [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8877257/finding-good-starting-points-
 for-douglas-peucker-algorithm-for-closed-polygons ideas] about it.  Not
 sure I totally agree with the suggestions, but they do have some ideas
 that are a starting point.

 How about this: find the vertex for which the triangle formed with the
 adjacent vertices has maximum height, and rotate the ring to use it as the
 starting point?  (Height being the perpendicular distance to the line
 between the adjacent points.  In the case of a regular polygon this is
 arbitrary, so no need to rotate).

Comment (by uclaros):

 A simplistic solution would be to take the current resulting polygon, use
 its 0, 1, n-1 and n (same as 0) vertices to decide if 0 and n vertices
 should also be removed. If so, remove them and append vertex 1 to the end
 to close the ring.

I'd like to get #1073 [1] via GitHub [2] included for Beta1.

This feature adds support for pkg-config, which can be tested by
packagers to see if (e.g.) `pkg-config geos --cflags --libs` does the
right thing.

 When trying to set an ordinate for a non-existing dimension, the C
 function no longer returns the correct error return value.

 See https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/issues/233#issuecomment-723860368 for
 context

 This seems to stem from a small mistake in the refactor in
 https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/8e29f768e6d8597a5568acd628712583506f9928,
 which accidentally changed the error return value for
 `GEOSCoordSeq_setOrdinate_r` from 0 to 1, so we no longer catch the error.
 I further checked the rest of the file, but I think this is the only case
 of a wrong return code.

Hi all,

On the CI of PyGEOS we have a build testing against GEOS master, and
somewhere in the last 4 days, a lot of the STRtree tests started failing
(see eg https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/runs/1465460418#step:9:86).
Looking at the commits of the last days, this might be related to the
SimpleSTRtree work?

A small (python) example of a tree consisting of a single point, which no
longer is returned when querying the tree with a big polygon that certainly
contains the point:

Using released version of GEOS:

>>> import pygeos
>>> pygeos.geos_version
(3, 8, 1)
>>> point = pygeos.Geometry("POINT (2 3)")
>>> tree = pygeos.STRtree([point])
>>> tree.query(pygeos.box(0, 0, 10, 10))
array([0])

This is correctly returning the index of the single point. But when running
with the latest GEOS master, the query doesn't find any point of the tree:

>>> import pygeos
>>> pygeos.geos_version
(3, 9, 0)
>>> point = pygeos.Geometry("POINT (2 3)")
>>> tree = pygeos.STRtree([point])
>>> tree.query(pygeos.box(0, 0, 10, 10))
array([], dtype=int64)

Are there changes expected in how the STRtree C API functions or required
changes in user code? Or maybe we are using it in some incorrect/unexpected
way? (code is at https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/blob/master/src/strtree.c)

Best,
Joris

There are changes, I don't think you're mis-using anything. I swapped the CAPI to use the SimpleSTRtree, figuring it would be good to share the performance win with downstream. However, I can swap it back to the original STRtree if this remains a problem.

One thing I noticed when trying to construct GEOS envelopes directly was that annoyingly they were xmin xmax, ymin ymax, but I doubt that would be a problem in your pre-existing working test. 

I just reconstructed your test in the GEOS CAPI suite, and it works as one would expect. (Namely, it finds the one point.) So I'm not sure why your test is getting different results.


// querying tree with box
template<>
template<>
void object::test<8>
()
{
    GEOSSTRtree* tree = GEOSSTRtree_create(10);
    GEOSGeometry* g = GEOSGeomFromWKT("POINT (2 3)");
    GEOSSTRtree_insert(tree, g, g);
    GEOSGeometry* q = GEOSGeomFromWKT("POLYGON ((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))");

    typedef std::vector<GEOSGeometry*> GList;
    GList geoms;
    ensure_equals(geoms.size(), 0);
    GEOSSTRtree_query(
        tree,
        q,
        [](void* item, void* userdata) {
            GList* geoms = (GList*)userdata;
            geoms->push_back((GEOSGeometry*)item);
        },
        &geoms);

    ensure_equals(geoms.size(), 1);
    const GEOSCoordSequence* seq = GEOSGeom_getCoordSeq(geoms[0]);

    double x = -1;
    double y = -1;
    GEOSCoordSeq_getXY(seq,  0, &x, &y);
    ensure_equals(x, 2.0);
    ensure_equals(y, 3.0);

    GEOSGeom_destroy(q);
    GEOSGeom_destroy(g);
    GEOSSTRtree_destroy(tree);
}

Comment (by robe):

 Sorry been distracted of late so just seeing this.  I haven't tested with
 the latest mingw64.  I've been using mingw64 gcc 8.1 and msys2.

 Which CMake are you using?  For some reason I could never get CMake to
 work with the ones I install in mingw as they seemed to be missing the
 msys makefiles.

 So I always used the 32-bit cmake windows binaries from
 https://cmake.org/download/

 I'm currently using the cmake-3.15.4-win32-x86 but the latest on the
 download site
 https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.19.1/cmake-3.19.1-win32-x86.zip
 should work fine.

 I'm guessing the 64-bit would work as well.  The main reason I use the
 32-bit is so I can use it under my msys 32-bit /mingw64-w32 builders.


 My build script looks like this very similar to yours.
 {{{
 export GCC_TYPE=81
   cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=${PROJECTS}/geos/rel-${GEOS_VER}w${OS_BUILD}${GCC_TYPE}
 -DHAVE_STD_ISNAN=1 -DHAVE_LONG_LONG_INT_64=1 -DDISABLE_GEOS_INLINE=ON  -
 ../${CMAKE_GEOS_VER}
 }}}

 I'm using GCC 8.1

Thanks for trying to reproduce it in C/C++. One obvious difference that I
can spot is that we use an integer for the "item" that gets inserted, and
not the geometry itself, but I wouldn't expect that to influence the
result.
Although, trying to update your test case to do that, the test fails. But
that might also be an issue on my side due to my limited C++ experience (it
already fails on the "geoms.size()" check):

Nope still not seeing it... one small mistake in your query, trying to cast the int to a void, instead of passing in a the pointer to the address, here's one that works. Unfortunately that leaves us no closer to knowing why the SimpleSTRtree is unhappy in the python context. I fear I may just have to revert the CAPI to the old tree.


// querying tree with box
template<>
template<>
void object::test<9>
()
{
    GEOSSTRtree* tree = GEOSSTRtree_create(10);

    GEOSGeometry* g = GEOSGeomFromWKT("POINT (2 3)");
    int payload = 876;
    GEOSSTRtree_insert(tree, g, &payload);

    GEOSGeometry* q = GEOSGeomFromWKT("POLYGON ((0 0, 10 0, 10 10, 0 10, 0 0))");

    typedef std::vector<int*> IList;
    IList items;
    ensure_equals(items.size(), 0);
    GEOSSTRtree_query(
        tree,
        q,
        [](void* item, void* userdata) {
            IList* items = (IList*)userdata;
            items->push_back((int*)item);
        },
        &items);

    ensure_equals(items.size(), 1);

    ensure_equals(*(items[0]), payload);

    GEOSGeom_destroy(q);
    GEOSGeom_destroy(g);
    GEOSSTRtree_destroy(tree);
}

While that seems to pick up about 3-5% speedwise, unfortunately something about my implementation is incorrect (and in a wonderfully subtle way) as it fails testing on some platforms (not mine). https://github.com/pramsey/geos/tree/monotone-chain-builder

My current test is a big union of watershed boundaries, about 6MB of data, which takes about 20s under GEOS and about 25% of that under JTS.  It's a big gap, and in theory the two code bases are pretty aligned right now. Same overlayNG engine, etc. So I figure there has to be a big implementation ball of performance hiding under the covers somewhere. No luck thus far.

Also not if you try my original code *with* the mistake?
Because your version indeed passes for me as well, but I *think* the
version I wrote resembles more closely the PyGEOS code (so it might be an
issue in our C code on how we use the tree).

Well, with the mistake the code is saying "here's a null pointer" (since that's what casting 0 to a void* will get you) index this. I'll see! It shouldn't really matter from an index point-of-view, it should still index it and return a null pointer out the back end.

For at least one use case I've seen 20% speed-ups on overlays, using the SimpleSTRtree in place of the STRtree inside the MCIndexNoder. I have not seen any slow-downs.

While that seems to pick up about 3-5% speedwise, unfortunately something about my implementation is incorrect (and in a wonderfully subtle way) as it fails testing on some platforms (not mine). https://github.com/pramsey/geos/tree/monotone-chain-builder

My current test is a big union of watershed boundaries, about 6MB of data, which takes about 20s under GEOS and about 25% of that under JTS.  It's a big gap, and in theory the two code bases are pretty aligned right now. Same overlayNG engine, etc. So I figure there has to be a big implementation ball of performance hiding under the covers somewhere. No luck thus far.

And indeed it does not work. So, something to examine... why can we not index with a null item?

Because I was using a non-null item pointer as a cue that the node was a leaf node, so it wasn't picking up null items as leaves. 
So, I've pushed that fix, does that change your test suite all that much?

For at least one use case I've seen 20% speed-ups on overlays, using the SimpleSTRtree in place of the STRtree inside the MCIndexNoder. I have not seen any slow-downs.

My current test is a big union of watershed boundaries, about 6MB of data, which takes about 20s under GEOS and about 25% of that under JTS. It's a big gap, and in theory the two code bases are pretty aligned right now. Same overlayNG engine, etc. So I figure there has to be a big implementation ball of performance hiding under the covers somewhere. No luck thus far.

Comment (by komzpa):

 Generally speaking Douglas-Peucker should be replaced with Visvalingam-
 Whyatt when doing anything about area. It is easily adaptable for rings.
 The epsilon will be an area then, it is usually ok to square the DP
 epsilon and run VW instead on areas.

Subject: [geos-devel] 3.9.0beta1 + GEOSwift
Message-ID: <CACZW30N+acruiUEfM0xN9frcZYav1ukNHO3zLOpPfWPFsvdMkg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all, I help maintain https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift

I'm testing out 3.9.0beta1 and have run into a couple things to share.

If you want to try any of these out directly with GEOSwift, I recommend
using the Swift Package Manager. You can clone
https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift.git and check out
branch geos-3.9.0-testing. Then run `$ swift test` to build and run the
tests. I'm using Swift 5.3.1. One way to get Swift is to use the Docker
image: https://hub.docker.com/_/swift

1) GeometryConvertible_GEOSTests.testMakeValidWhenItIsAPolygon()

This test is checking that makeValid() (a wrapper around the CAPI's
GEOSMakeValid_r) produces an expected result given some pre-defined
geometry. Here's what happened:

Input:

Polygon(
  exterior: LinearRing(
    points: [
      Point(x: 0, y: 0),
      Point(x: 2, y: 0),
      Point(x: 1, y: 1),
      Point(x: 0, y: 2),
      Point(x: 2, y: 2),
      Point(x: 1, y: 1),
      Point(x: 0, y: 0)
    ]
  )
)

Actual (wrapped in a multipolygon)

Polygon(
  exterior: LinearRing(
    points: [
      Point(x: 0, y: 2),
      Point(x: 2, y: 2),
      Point(x: 1, y: 1),
      Point(x: 0, y: 2)
    ]
  )
)

Polygon(
  exterior: LinearRing(
    points: [
      Point(x: 2, y: 0),
      Point(x: 0, y: 0),
      Point(x: 1, y: 1),
      Point(x: 2, y: 0)
    ]
  )
)

Expected (wrapped in any order in a multipolygon)

Polygon(
  exterior: LinearRing(
    points: [
      Point(x: 1, y: 1),
      Point(x: 2, y: 0),
      Point(x: 0, y: 0),
      Point(x: 1, y: 1)
    ]
  )
)

Polygon(
  exterior: LinearRing(
    points: [
      Point(x: 1, y: 1),
      Point(x: 0, y: 2),
      Point(x: 2, y: 2),
      Point(x: 1, y: 1)
    ]
  )
)

Since these are topologically equivalent, I've just updated the test to
check for that instead of exact equality (see GEOSwift
commit 6c4b191646623159528433fbd112c11ddce7c5ea on the aforementioned
branch), but I thought I'd share here just in case this behavior is
unexpected.

2) GeometryConvertible_GEOSTests.testBufferAllTypes()

This test is intended to be a sort of stress-test to make sure that all the
types of geometry on which GEOSwift allows you to invoke buffer(by:)
(wrapper around the CAPI's GEOSBuffer_r) can actually be buffered. In geos
3.8.1, all the sample geometries were able to be buffered without any
issues.

Here's what we get for one of the test cases with 3.9.0beta1:

Input:

  geometries: [
    GeometryCollection(
      geometries: [
        Point(x: 1.0, y: 2.0),

buffer(by: 0.5)

errorMessage: "IllegalArgumentException: Overlay input is mixed-dimension"

The exception is being thrown from EdgeNodingBuilder.cpp:195.

In frame #2, i = 0

In frame #0, i = 0

This suggests to me that it's checking the dimension of the Point inside of
the child GeometryCollection inside of the parent GeometryCollection.

g->getDimension() is returning 0 (geos::geom::Dimension::DimensionType P)
and expectedDim is 2.

Here's a relevant stack trace:

Of all the design decisions made in the white heat of the development of
the initial release of JTS, the ordering of arguments to the Envelope
constructor is one I regret most.  Don't see a way to change it now though
(ideas welcome).

I've been thinking of an alternate way to construct an envelope when you
know which of your inputs is the min. Currently GEOS assumes they're
unordered and checks which x value is the min and which is the max, so
there is a tiny optimization potential here. We could kill two birds with
one stone and "fix" the ordering:

Good point - I didn't see that additional semantic to your PR.  No harm in
having such a method.  Not sure about the naming, though.

Now, as mentioned on the commit comments on github (
https://github.com/libgeos/geos/commit/ad0122541f85886cf9eb9dd65d8246e0144f7ffa#commitcomment-44623679),
if you rather not support this on the GEOS side, I am fine with having to
fix this in PyGEOS to have it working correctly with GEOS 3.9.

I quickly started looking at a fix in PyGEOS at
https://github.com/pygeos/pygeos/pull/261 (it's not yet working though, I
suppose because we need to keep track of the inserted items)

Looking at PrecisionReducer::reducePrecision, it seems like it should perhaps have a little extra logic so that each dimension of the input are handled separately. Underlying the op is just 

  OverlayNG ov(geom, nullptr, gf.get(), OverlayNG::UNION);

So doing that a dimension at a time for any heterogeneous collection makes sense, IMO.

Agreed about the need to handle each dimension of the input separately.
Polygonal elements need to be reduced in a topologically correct way using
OverlayNG PrecisionReducer, and other dimensions can just be reduced in
pointwise fashion.

I intended this logic to go into GeometryPrecisionReducer, rather than
OverlayNG PrecisionReducer, since that preserves the existing API.  I see
now that the logic there is not complete - it handles Polygonal geometries,
but not collections containing Polygonal geometry.  I'll ticket that for
fixing in JTS.

Comment (by Mike Taves):

 Revisiting this with 3.9.0beta1
 {{{
 ls = [x for x in mls.geoms]
 u = ops.unary_union(ls)
 print(len(u))  # 246
 print(u.length) # 27.7963165274577
 print(u.is_valid)  # True
 print(u.is_simple)  # True
 }}}
 so it looks like the unary union with OverlayNG cleaned up several
 redundant line segments, and created a valid/simple output.

 See https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/358 to add this as a test.

 And I'll assume there are more geometry parts than the original to make a
 valid geometry.

 Over in Shapely, there is a test suite
 [https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely/blob/b2b536004ee6b8316fffcee36ff8e1e65be71958/tests/test_create_inconsistent_dimensionality.py
 test_create_inconsistent_dimensionality.py] that checks WKT with
 inconsistent dimensionality. For most instances, a geometry with at least
 one 3D coordinate is promoted with a Z dimension, assuming Z=0 for other
 XY coordinates. There are a few isolated cases where the geometry remains
 as a 2D geometry if the 3D coordinate is not the first.

 Of these inconsistencies, one new inconsistency stands out as new and
 unusual.

 GEOS 3.8.1 and earlier:
 {{{
 # preserve 3rd dimension
 LINESTRING (1 1 1, 2 2) -> LINESTRING Z (1 1 1, 2 2 0)
 # drop 3rd dimension
 LINESTRING (1 1, 2 2 2) -> LINESTRING (1 1, 2 2)
 }}}
 Since GEOS 3.9.0beta1:
 {{{
 # drop 3rd dimension
 LINESTRING (1 1 1, 2 2) -> LINESTRING (1 1, 2 2)
 # preserve 3rd dimension
 LINESTRING (1 1, 2 2 2) -> LINESTRING Z (1 1 0, 2 2 2)
 }}}
 why is this the only geometry type scenario that swaps behaviour? Ideally
 any geometry with at lest one 3D coordinate would be promoted with a Z
 dimension.

You can clone https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift.git and check out branch geos-3.9.0-testing. Then run `$ swift test` to build and run the tests. I'm using Swift 5.3.1. One way to get Swift is to use the Docker image: https://hub.docker.com/_/swift

Comment (by pramsey):

 It seems inconsistent all around, to me. What is the consistent rule
 supposed to be? My guess would have been "preserve the dimensionality of
 the first coordinate)" but this test belies that:
 {{{
     ('MULTIPOINT (1 1, 2 2 2)', 'MULTIPOINT Z (1 1 0, 2 2 2)'),
 }}}
 I suppose not changing behaviour is the highest good, I hate to see that
 version switch there when we haven't got consistent behaviour. I guess
 it's too late to be as strict as the PostGIS parser (dimensional mixing ==
 error).

Comment (by pramsey):

 Reading through WKTReader, it seems like the general goal is to promote
 the dimensionality of a given CoordinateSequence to the highest
 dimensionality encountered in the sequence. That doesn't seem to match the
 behaviour of the polygon case though, nor the new behaviour of the
 linestring case. In any event, the current model sort of sucks since it's
 possible to make a POLYGON with mixed dimension rings, or a
 multilinestring with mixed dimension members. Also you can make a
 linestringz with 2d coordinates, because the dimensionality tag is mostly
 ignored. (Not always).

Looks good. The GEOSwift test suite passes with your change. Thanks!

Subject: [geos-devel] 3.9.0beta + GEOSwift + Linux
Message-ID: <CACZW30PS7SUpxbscn8AWFP70VF+251i8XdLgKQ6yJ1e9sFir9g@mail.gmail.com>

Found another issue with the beta when testing GEOSwift on Linux
(specifically, compiling in a Docker container using the Swift Docker
image). Here's what I'm doing:

$ sudo docker run -it --rm swift /bin/bash
# cd home
# git clone https://github.com/GEOSwift/GEOSwift.git
# cd GEOSwift
# git checkout geos-3.9.0-testing
# swift test --enable-test-discovery -v

Among other things, this yields the following line for LineLimiter.cpp:

/usr/bin/clang -target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu -fPIC -g -O0
-DSWIFT_PACKAGE=1 -DDEBUG=1 -fblocks -fmodules -fmodule-name=geos -I
/home/GEOSwift/.build/checkouts/geos/Sources/geos/public
-fmodules-cache-path=/home/GEOSwift/.build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/ModuleCache
-DUSE_UNSTABLE_GEOS_CPP_API
-I/home/GEOSwift/.build/checkouts/geos/Sources/geos/include -MD -MT
dependencies -MF
/home/GEOSwift/.build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/geos.build/src/operation/overlayng/LineLimiter.cpp.d

/home/GEOSwift/.build/checkouts/geos/Sources/geos/src/operation/overlayng/LineLimiter.cpp
-o
/home/GEOSwift/.build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/debug/geos.build/src/operation/overlayng/LineLimiter.cpp.o

And this corresponding error:

/home/GEOSwift/.build/checkouts/geos/Sources/geos/src/operation/overlayng/LineLimiter.cpp:121:24:
error: no member named 'unique' in namespace 'std'
    ptList->erase(std::unique(ptList->begin(), ptList->end()),
ptList->end());
                  ~~~~~^

Here's some clang version info:

clang version 10.0.0 (git at github.com:apple/llvm-project.git
3093af41dd65ad466dcd5603e9289244edfee4f5)
Target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /usr/bin

Any idea what might be going on here?

Add #include <algorithm>
to LineLimiter.cpp see if that helps?

Not sure why only your version would have this problem. Maybe it's in different headers sometimes?

While I don't know how to fix the issue, I've recompiled the issue
with tests\unit\simplify\TopologyPreservingSimplifierTest.cpp to show

I looked into the git log for TopologyPreservingSimplifierTest.cpp and found this:

commit 7014e2b6509709f70dc08ca3b4b4d843d3df2a71
Author: Daniel Baston <dbaston at gmail.com>
Date:   Sat Dec 22 20:49:22 2018 -0500

    Change std::map to std::unordered_map in TopologyPreservingSimplifier

If I change the unordered_map back to a map... I get the exact same unit test failure on my MacOS machine. I've pushed a branch to see if it now succeeds under MSVC.

That works. I had to add it to KdTree.cpp as well. Agree that it's strange.

Seems like the macOS builds are getting their <vector> from llvm's libc++
but that the build in the Swift Docker container is using the GNU C++.
LLVM's vector
(Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/../include/c++/v1/vector)
imports algorithm. The GNU C++ version doesn't (at least not directly). I
find this Swift Package Manager behavior on Linux strange because the
GEOSwift/geos package definition specifically requests "cxx11" (as opposed
to "gnucxx11"). I'll see whether someone from the Swift team can shed
some light on what's going on here.
