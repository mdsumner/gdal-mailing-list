Subject: [geos-devel] GIT repo url updated
Message-ID: <20171217124249.hahdlfyhvfpenobu@liz>

Following an upgrade of OSGeo GIT hostign services technology
from Gogs to Gitea [1] the official GEOS git repository URL
changed to:

  https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos.git

Assuming your official remote is called "origin", you can update its
url running the following command from within your clone:

  git config remote.origin.url https://git.osgeo.org/gitea/geos/geos.git

You can replace "origin" with whatever it is called.

Or, if you feel adventurous, you may try the following, which works
for any other repository you may be tracking from the OSGeo git hosting
service:

  sed -i 's|/gogs/|/gitea/|' .git/config

NOTE: redirects are in place so there's no rush to do this, just be
      aware

Why are the URLs changing and not stable? Should we expect to have to sed our repositories ever few months as OSGeo changes its infrastructure over and over again?

For reference, the GitHub "mirror" hasn't moved, has 80 forks and nearly 30 people watching it https://github.com/osgeo/geos The base of contributors who wish to participate is there. Is easier to get a bank account than an OSGeo ID nowadays. It's like this project doesn't want people to contribute.

Why must this project keep tilting at this windmill?

Because the service was (and still is) experimental.
It changed URl a few times already, but always
with proper redirects left in place.

You can keep the old URL, it'll still work. It's just nice to
recognize what we're using (Gitea, no more Gogs) and avoids an
hop to directly go to the new URL.

> For reference, the GitHub "mirror" hasn't moved

It actually was, used to be on libgeos/libgeos before Mat
moved it to osgeo/geos. I did change my git config at that time
(although also GitHub provides redirects).

I'm glad the mirror is being effective.

Nobody wants to kick them out. Pull requests are open.

Last time I checked banks wanted national ID cards, we are ok
with a trustworthy email or website :)

Why do you think so ? I love good contributions.

> Why must this project keep tilting at this windmill?

It's actually pretty stable. Still using Trac, still on OSGeo,
and not having many commits either. The biggest recent move
has been from SVN to GIT, was it too much wind for you ?
Should we move back to SVN ? (I didn't start this :P)

strk,

I'm so proud of you.  You kept your cool and answered well.  I can't say I would have handled Hobu's negativity as well.
Looking forward to using gitea more.  Thanks for all the hard work.

Experimentation is very important to explore new avenues of working.  
We must not all follow the beat of the same drum for there lies the death of creation.


Thanks,
Regina

My negativity stems from arbitrary changes to infrastructure for little benefit and complete consternation for developers trying to use and depend upon GEOS. I'm also rage transferring anger about USE_UNSTABLE_GEOS_CPP_API to this topic, which feels just as arbitrary.

Is that true for GEOS' code too, or just its infrastructure? GEOS doesn't really deviate at all from JTS for its API, and its C++ API was just marked as leprotic for reasons I still don't fully comprehend. Contributions that would change the API in ways that are incompatible or inconvenient with PostGIS are unwelcome.

Is GEOS a generic C++ geometry algebra library or is GEOS a support library for PostGIS that's coincidentally sometimes useful to outside software? I think the friction comes from the intractable tension between these two things, and it's maybe it is just time for me and my ilk who want the former to move on.

Dear developers,

OSGeo Code Sprint will come to Bonn (Germany) in March 2018 [1]. You are 
invited to join us.

When:

- Sun 2018-⁠⁠03-⁠⁠19 12:00 noon -⁠⁠ Sun 2018-⁠⁠03-⁠⁠25 12:00 noon

Where:

- Venue & Accommodation: BaseCamp Bonn (For more informations: 
http://www.basecamp-bonn.com/)

- Accomodation Booking System: 
http://www.bonn-region.de/events/fossgis.html

Interested? So read more about why & where & when...

The Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) has a long tradition of 
organizing code sprints for developers of Open Source GIS software.

For several years the Open Source Geospatial Foundation (OSGeo) [1] has 
been organizing a yearly Code Sprint, a come-together of the "C Tribe" 
OSGeo projects - now we call it OSGeo Code Sprint. Leading developers of 
projects like GDAL, PostGIS, MapServer, QGIS, PDAL, and many more get 
together to discuss new ideas, hack, decide, tackle large geospatial 
problems & more & simply to have fun.

In 2018 the OSGeo Code Sprint will come again to Europe after Vienna 
(2014) [6] and Paris in (2016) [4]. This makes is possible to embed 
European developers and users.
The tradition started in 2011 with Toronto [11], then New York [10], 
Montreal [9], Island Wood [8] and Boston [7]. And went to Philadelphia 
in 2015 [5] and last year to Daytona Beach (2017) [3]. Find a list of 
code sprints at [12].

OSGeo Code Sprint 2018 in Bonn
------------------------------
This year the international code sprint of the OSGeo will take place 
from 19 to 25 March 2018 simultaneously with the FOSSGIS Conference 2018 
in Bonn. We offer a setting so that individual projects can meet for 
their code sprint.

The code sprint will take place at BaseCamp in Bonn. During the FOSS4G 
2016 in Bonn we have already organized a code sprint at this location, 
in which about 100 developers worked on the open source projects every 
day. (https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/FOSS4G_2016_Code_Sprint). It is a 
really awesome location. Codesprint and accommodations are combined in 
one hall and you will live in a caravan, bus or cabin.

Check out http://www.basecamp-bonn.com/ for details about the venue.

Acommodations
-------------
Working zones will be created for you in the breakfast area and 
hallways. Healthy and not-so-healthy catering of drinks and snacks will 
be provided by us. Participation in codesprint is free of charge. 
However, overnight stays will have to be reserved and paid for by 
yourself.

BaseCamp is an indoor campground and offers different caravans, night 
sleepers, Airstreams, a Trabant, Volkswagen transporter and other places 
to stay.

If you prefer to stay in a hotel - no problem. Bonnox Boardinghouse is 
close-by. And you also find many great hotels in Bonn.

Book your room soon
-------------------
As the accommodations are as well available to FOSSGIS 2018 participants 
we will make an effort to make advance booking possible for you a few 
days ahead, to ensure you have the opportunity to sleep on-site and wrap 
up the evenings jointly.
Therefore, please book your accomondation as soon as possible via the 
booking system http://www.bonn-region.de/events/fossgis.html


Register for the OSGeo Code Sprint
-------------------------------------
And don't forget to sign up in the OSGeo wiki at our OSGeo Code Spint 
2018 page:
  https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Code_Sprint_2018

This is important for us, not only for the planning of snacks and 
drinks.


The OSGeo Code Sprint is open to all who wish to participate in one or 
more projects. There is always plenty to do – it’s not all about 
programming. Translation, documentation, feedback, discussions, testing 
– all this is also important for projects so everyone is cordially 
invited to attend the codesprint!

The Codesprint Organizing Team is looking forward to your coming!

Summarily:

When:

  Sun 2018-⁠⁠03-⁠⁠19 12:00 noon -⁠⁠ Sun 2018-⁠⁠03-⁠⁠25 12:00 noon
