Subject: [geos-devel] GEOS License and iOS usage
Message-ID: <6845F5DA-BCA0-4C59-95CF-D0E1B46C569B@gmx.de>

Hi everybody,

I'd like to include libspatialite (https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/index ) in a proprietary iPhone App. libspatialite depends on GEOS which is licensed under LGPL.
As far as I know, it is possible to use LGPLed software on iOS if the object files for custom relinking are provided. There are still problems in using LGPLed software on iOS listed in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/459833/which-open-source-licenses-are-compatible-with-the-iphone-and-app-store
specifically the need for a free iOS SDK which obviously isn't available.

So what do you, the developers of geos, think about using it on iOS? Do you generally approve the usage on iOS?

Are there any chances to license GEOS under a more permissive license like MPL or to tri-license it like stated in http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/boilerplate-1.1/mpl-tri-license-html ?

I know this is a difficult question, but it would be a pity, not being able to use geos on mobile devices because of these constraints.

Kind regards
Stefan

Sorry, there's a bug in your last statement.
It's not impossible to use geos on "mobile devices".
It is just that specific mobile device preventing its users from
changing applications that run on it.

Beside, isn't spatialite GPL ?

FYI, GEOS is a direct port of JTS [1].
IMO, your question fits the JTS mailing list first.

Yes you are right. I should have written "iPhones". Android allows shared libraries. I'm not sure about Windows Phone though.

> Beside, isn't spatialite GPL ?
No, spatialite is MPL tri-licensed. So it is available under MPL 1.1, GPL v2 and LGPL v2.1

Do you mean

   create a proprietary iPhone app and distribute it outside of the app
   store?

or

  create a proprietary iPhone app and distribute it in the app store.

Your note was unclear, and it's a big difference.

Do the app store terms permit a user to relink an application they have
obtained?  It seems fairly clear that they do not (in practice anwyay),
and that would make their terms and the LPGL incompatible.

The other view is that it's sad that much free software cannot be used
on Apple devices because of Apple's constraints.  I suggest you ask them
to change, rather than asking for change from people who have chosen a
license intended to preserve the software freedom of users.  (And this
is about Apple restrictions, not about "mobile"; please don't conflate
those two things.)

It's a app distributed in the app store.

I'm not a lawyer, but to my knowledge, it is enough to provide the 
object files "outside" the app store, giving the user the possibility to 
create their custom version of the app.

I didn't want to start a fight here. I just wanted to hear others 
opinions. I estimate the chances of getting apple to change their 
linking restrictions to be nearly zero. I even understand these 
decisions from a security point of view.
I'm a big fan of open source software and I'm trying to participate in 
the projects I use on a daily basis. For me, the main Idea behind the 
LGPL is: Use this code if you like, but contribute any changes you make 
back to the community.
I don't think that the requirement of every user being able to replace 
the LGPLed parts, fits the current evolution of mobile ecosystems like 
iOS. But that's a personal opinion.

So again - no offense, I only think that spatialite/geos are great 
products and I wanted to find a way to legally use and support them.

Stefan

Picking a ticket on trac for review or fix would be an excellent start.

Comment(by dazuma):

 We've just noticed this as well in production

 Some info from us:

 * We're running on the Amazon Linux AMI (Centos-based)
 * We're running 3.3.3 currently. (We'll try upgrading to 3.3.5 and see if
 it persists.)
 * Currently, we are able to reproduce it on pretty much any
 GEOSDistance_r() call, measuring between two point objects.
 * There is a possibility it may be related to changes to C++ runtime
 libraries. We know that this was working fine earlier, and at some point
 (without us recompiling GEOS or making any changes to it whatsoever), we
 started seeing this consistent behavior, so we suspect perhaps yum updated
 something out from under us.
 * Our compiler is gcc 4.4. We didn't use any weird switches when
 originally compiling geos.

 Here is a stack trace that might be useful. (This is not ours, but one
 from someone on the spatialite mailing list who saw the same thing on
 3.3.2, again calling GEOSDistance_r on two point objects.)

Comment(by dazuma):

 Correction to the above. It looks like this may never have been "working
 fine earlier"; the C++ runtime library comment was likely me chasing a red
 herring.

 I can reproduce this consistently on this platform (Amazon Linux/CentOS),
 and never on my other platform of choice (Mac OS X).

That's a classic JTS/GEOS overlay robustness failure, unfortunately.  
It's caused by the presence of almost-coincident lines.

The usual suggestion is to try reducing precision (snapping to a grid), 
but it looks like maybe you've tried that?  You could try reducing 
precision even more, perhaps.

A more drastic approach would be to perturb every vertex by a small 
random amount.  But there's no guarantee this will help, and it may not 
fit your use case.

Here's another somewhat drastic approach - buffer one of the geometries 
by a very, very small amount and run the overlay.  I tried this using a 
buffer distance of 1e-9, and it allowed the difference to be computed.

Hi

Thanks a lot for your help, you guys are doing a great job for the open-source community.

I have tested your suggestion and it seems to work, but I had to change the value 1e-8 to handle some other cases.

I have made a function called Fussy_Difference where I use buffer when I get an Excepetion.

When I run the script now it runs through I see the messages when when it have to try the buffer operation.
NOTICE: Failed to run Difference, try buffer with 1e-08. Area difference area for g1 0.99999031027232 and for g2 0.999995189146681


We see the TopologyException errors quite often and different people seem to handle them in different ways.

If we in POSTGIS could have a way to handle this problem in a more common way that could help us a lot.

For instance if we in POSTGIS could have settings where we could configure what to do when we get 
TopologyException from ST_Difference or any other POSTGIS function.

Then we could configure the Postgis enviroment to handle the TopologyException in a way that is best for our case. 

What to do depends of course on what kind data you have and the usage, but after a while we will get the 
experience that buffer with 1e-8 seems to work ok on data in degrees for Norway when use ST_Difference .

We can of course wrap the Postgis functions into our own functions like Fussy_Difference, but if we use Geoserver or 
other tools against the database, it may not be possible to use your own functions.

I have also tested with reduced precision but that causes to many polygons to collaps and we get incorrect results, 
so we also need some tests on the changed data to verify that the changes are inside the tolrances we can accept in our case.

Her is the Fussy_Difference function that I use.


CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_sql.Fussy_Difference(g1 geometry,g2 geometry) RETURNS geometry AS $$DECLARE

newg geometry;

-- helper variables for use when EXCEPTION

g1_area_before_buffer float;

g2_area_before_buffer float;

g1 = St_Buffer(g1,buffer_value);

g2 = St_Buffer(g2,buffer_value);

newg = ST_Difference(g1,g2);

END;

RETURN newg;

END;

$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_sql.fraction_area(a1 float, a2 float) RETURNS float8 AS $$DECLARE

IF (a1 < a2) THEN

fractioin = a1/a2;

ELSE

END IF;

END IF;

RETURN fractioin;

END;

 Consider the following MultiPolygon:

 MULTIPOLYGON(EMPTY, ((0 1, 1 1, 1 0, 0 0, 0 1)))

 I'm not completely clear on whether this should be considered a valid
 MultiPolygon. Most calls handle it fine. However, calling
 GEOSGetCentroid_r on it results in a segmentation fault.

 The seg fault seems to happen when the MultiPolygon contains at least one
 EMPTY polygon *and* at least one non-empty polygon. MultiPolygons
 containing only EMPTYs or only non-emptys work fine.

Hi everyone,

I have a question concerning the precision of predicates, and mainly touches. On the JTS website, I read "The algorithms used to implement the SFS predicates and functions have been developed to eliminate or minimize robustness problems. The binary predicate algorithm is completely robust."

In GEOS, is combinatorial also used for the binary predicates, and are they totally robust ?

Thanks
