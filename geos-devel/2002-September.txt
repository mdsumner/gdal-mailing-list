Sure, but it would also be very good if you can write down all the changes and
send them to me. This way I can avoid repeating them.

One note though: I am not sure that the version you are experimenting on will
compile even after you fix all incompatibilities. You should check out the
current version. I've just tested it and it should compile (I haven't committed
some of the incomplete files to ensure that). We also probably have to decide on
how to indicate it in the future versions. I frequently check in  files that are
incomplete (or have missing interdependencies) so that might be a common
problem.

Norman, Ferdinando,
I have added you to the CVS writers access list. I will mail your 
id/passwd info separately.
Ferdinando, if you could take Norman's structure and add the 
one-library-only change discussed before that would be good. No hurry at 
this point, we are not going to start integration w/ postgis until 
predicates actually work independantly in geos.
Norman, any help on portability you can offer is always appreciated.
Yury, since there are now more people than you committing to the archive 
remember that it will be important to 'update -dP' alot more often 
(before and after each hacking session, to ensure clean and healthy 
teeth) to ensure you are working against up-to-date sources.
P.

Yeah, graph/index seems broken for me. Are you sure that the complete 
compilable sources have actually been committed to the archive?

On the tagging, I think we should start tagging for version which has 
(a) new functionality from the last tagged version (b) is known to both 
compile and has been tested against the harness for its functionality.

This is very strange. 'graph/index' has been committed more than a week ago and
it is complete and compiles on my PC.
I've also checked out the latest version (with your updates) and it compiles as
well.

Hi all,

I've just committed the following changes. Let me know if there's any
problem associated with them. Ciao f

* Add automake/autoconf support for one-lib compilation

* add libtool support for shared libraries. --enable-shared={yes|no} and
  --enable-static={yes|no} control static and shared lib generation.

* Makefile.in and configure files added to cvs (for users without
automake)

* add dir macros/ with a GEOS_INIT macro to be used in configure.in
  of other packages using geos (not used by geos itself)

* add dir tools/ with geos-config script

* the makefile in source/geom is the only one that generates a
  library - all others have the source files in EXTRA_DIST only

* small glitch: 'make dist' will give errors trying to add the
  source files non local to source/geom to the archive using relative
  paths. Does not have consequences other than the error messages - will
  see if I can fix this. In general the one-lib, complex-tree solution
is not
  easy to work with in automake.

Sweet!
Not only does this work for me, but my "compilation problem" in 
graph/index which Yury was wondering about was in fact just a missing 
dependency problem which your build process neatly fixes.
Great work Ferdinando,

Hi All,

Ferdinando's libtoolizing seems to work well for me, with
only minor modifications, on Cygwin and Mingw32, however
I haven't had much joy trying to get this to compile with either
 gcc version 2.95.3-10 (cygwin special)
   or the MUCH more  standard compliant but pickier
 gcc version 3.2 (mingw special 20020817-1)

If I can be so bold migh I suggest that the MSVC developers 'try' 
compiling this using the STL_PORT Library occasionally :-)

Another suggestion is that we use the C++ namespace feature.
I think that this would greatly enhance the usability of this code
esp. given the 'reasonably common' classnames that are being 
used

Cheers

Norman

I strongly agree on the namespace issue (particularly so since we can
use a nice namespace id such as 'geos'). I'd also like to see the 'using
namespace std' removed from the headers, not that it matters much if the
namespace is std, but it's very bad practice in general. 

Norman - if you need libtool-related mods that won't break the Unix
build, please feel free to commit them.

Now more than ever I'm happy that we developed GEOS (JTS) originally in Java....

Using a namespace of "geos" sounds like a good idea to me.

So if we removing "using namespace std", what do we do instead?  Prefix all the STL classes with "std:"?  Or do we even need it?

[ Sigh...  my C++ expertise is obviously getting woefully out of date.  (But you know what - I'm not sure how much I care, now that the world has two simpler solutions which appear to have no loss in expressive power). ]

As for the other compatibility problems, is using STLPort the best solution for MSVC developers to ensure compatibility?  Or would it better to cross compile with gcc Ver 3.2 ?

it's not really a big issue, but the kosher approach would be to prefix
all STL stuff with std:: in the headers, and 'using namespace std' in
the source files. Otherwise including the headers could cause naming
conflicts to someone who's not using the stl and wants to use the same
identifiers. The fact that most C++ programs use it makes it a small
issue, but it's sensible programming practice nevertheless.

Cross compiling with gcc Ver 3.2 would be GREAT !

You can use msys on a Windows machine.

Hi all

I have finally managed to build Geos with Cygwin

this required a quite a few changes mostly similar to
// DirectedEdge *deLast=(DirectedEdge*) edges->at(size-1);
    DirectedEdge *deLast=(DirectedEdge*)(*edges)[size-1];

Should I send a diff, or whole files to someone for review ?

Might be best to send whole files to Yury.  (jump in here if that's not your preference, Yury.)  He can diff them himself and make the changes.

Why are the changes required?  A difference in the STL spec?
