Great, thanks for the link!
My approach for the incremental topology creation is 
a first-come best-served one. Hot pixels are nodes by definition,
every node of an existing topology is an hot-pixel there.

But it's not easy to determine the grid size, which that paper
is based upon, right ? How close should a segment be to a node
in order to snap there ? In other words, how big is the hot pixel ?

It'd surely be useful to let the user specify such grid (tolerance?)
when invoking GEOS functions.

It's also interesting to note that the floating point number grid 
is of variable size, with cells growing in size while moving away 
from origin.

Data-dependent.  I think you need to let the user choose.  You should be 
able to get away with 10 digits of precision.

Snap-rounding assumes a fixed-point coordinate system.  It's not going 
to be able to handle datasets with huge variation in scale.

I agree, it needs to be decided once and globally.

I've been thinking about the "expanding grid" idea and realized
you just _can't_ rely on it because if you have to compute a grid
based on ordinate values you can only do it _locally_ so you'd need
to recompute it for every intersection point (and scaling to the
origin to improve robustness would also change those "local" numbers
making it even harder to tell).

The alternative of computing "min_grid_size" based on each operation
is also broken because an operation performed on a long edge (insert
a long edge into the existing topology) will have to use a large grid
(the size of the biggest cell within the new edge extent) while a point
you may have added before would have used a smaller grid size so you'd
end up with different tolerances which would create hard or impossible
to manage situations (multiple candidate hotpixels to snap to).

> You should be able to get away with 10 digits of precision.

Yep, that's about the value my convoluted "find out min tolerance"
gives you. Could be 10 digits very much on the left of the decimal
digits too...

If instructed by user about the cell size it wouldn't need to assume
anything, right ? That'd probably be the aim.

cell size = fixed-precision coordinate system, right?

Or am I not understanding your "cell size"?

Yes, by "cell-size" I mean a fixed-precision coordinate system.

Comment(by robe):

 mingw32 which one do you mean (the 3.4.5 ? ).  I forget because that one
 gives like 5 or 6 errors so I didn't pay much attention to it. That we
 have a separate ticket for I think on GEOS with all the noted errors.

 I'm planning to switch my 32-build to the mingw 64 chain BTW.

 IT may not work right for ming32 either which would explain the numerous
 errors.

 Regarding what the spatialite guy did to hack the platform.h to hardcode
 the right answer:


 {{{
  typedef long long int int64;
 }}}

 He described in
 http://www.gaia-gis.it/spatialite-3.0.0-BETA/mingw64_how_to.html#libgeos


 When rebuilding my mingw 64 to make sure I didn't miss anything, I left
 out this step to see what would happen.  It compiled but I ended up with
 about 30 errors on make check.  Putting it back got me back to the single
 harmless IND failure.

 float-store was on in both situations.

Greetings all,

Using the CAPI if you have a geometry, you set its' SRID, then perform 
for example a buffer on this geometry, the result geometry does not get 
set with the input geometries SRID and you have to set it again. Is this 
the way it's intended to work or should the result keep the SRID?

Hello,

is it possible in some way to modify vertices on geometries, without making
copies ?

In my case I just want to perform transformations/projections, no internal
structures will be altered.

It should be possible with the C++ api.
Check out coordinate transformation classes.

Probably not very well tested.

I do use the C++ API, and have been taking a look at
geos::geom::util::GeometryTransformer.

geos::geom::util::GeometryTransformer is based on copying aswell, or, at
least I can't see
an way to change that behaviour ?

------------------------+---------------------------------------------------
 I'm Sandro Furieri, developer and maintainer of SpatiaLite.
 I noticed some nasty crash caused by the current GEOS 3.3.2 on Windows 7
 (64 bit): I compiled GEOS using the MinGW64 compiler, but may well be that
 all these issues are caused by Win64 runtime libs and not by MinGW itself
 (not really sure about this).

 Anyway, it's surely interesting to note that on the same identical
 platform, anything runs smoothly (no crash at all) when I build a 32 bit
 executable using MinGW32 and compiling the same identical sources. These
 are the issues I noticed on MinGW64:

 issue #1:
 {{{
 ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32
 make

 }}}

 please note: this issue seems similar to the one reported on ticket #509,
 but it's not identical. and in my case it works nicely when for MinGW 32
 bit.



 issue #2:[[BR]]
 GEOSIsValid() crashes when examining this geometry:
 {{{
 LINESTRING(1 2, 1 2)
 }}}
 please note: this Linestring simply has two points, and both them
 have identical coordinates.
 on Linux32, Linux64 and Win32 the same op simply returns an error
 and some warning as expected.

 issue #3:[[BR]]
 GEOSIsValid() crashes again when examining this geometry:
 {{{
 POLYGON((10 10, 15 10, 15 10, 10 15, 10 10), (5 5, 20 5, 20 20, 5 20, 5
 5))
 }}}
 please note: this Polygon is invalid, because the Interior Ring is
 completely
 outside the Exterior Ring.
 yet again, on Linux32, Linux64 and Win32 the same op works as expected.

 bye Sandro

Comment(by robe):

 Sandro,

 Which gcc are you using in your MingW64. As I recall, I don't think I was
 getting make check errors on the MingW64 chain, just the newer MingW that
 comes packaged with I think 4.6.1.  On the MingW64 I compiled geos with,
 it was something like 4.4.something but I haven't recently compiled on my
 newer MingW64 which is with gcc 4.5.something.

 BTW -- thanks for the Mingw64 instructions :)

GEOS PSC,

I am recommending the GEOS project to the incubation committee
for graduation.  One part of that is the need identify a "Project Officer".
Usually this is the PSC Chair though GEOS does not seem to have
identified a particular chair in RFC1 (http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/RFC1)
or the PSC (http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/PSC) page.

I would appreciate it if the PSC could nominate a representative, possibly
keeping track of them as chair in the PSC wiki page.   My personal
suggestion even though I'm not a PSC member would be strk or failing
that pramsey.

Best regards,

Let me try to address the draft checklist.

Open:

The code is under an open source license (LGPL).
Communication is done via the open mailing list and Trac.
Decision making is open, on the list, though my concern is that the
project hasn't really had contentious decisions to make so I'm not
fully confident in the maturity of the project in making tough decisions.
But I am not concerned about it being too closed.

Active and healthy community:

The developers and users are cooperative and open.

I am concerned about the size of the developer community, though there
are multiple contributors from different organizations so I think this is ok.


Copyright and License:

1. Again, the code is under an open source license.
2. I believe the API documentation is under LGPL by virtue of being
derived from the source files.  There is relatively little other
documentation.
3. The code is properly vetted as part of the provenence review.
4. I do not believe the project keeps a list of copyright holders
identified in the provenance review, and now that I come on this item
in the checklist I question it's appropriateness.  We do not normally
expect projects to keep a list of copyright holders.
5. The commiters have agreed to the license policy.  I'm not sure
about this agreement being archived.  I see this is archived for Chuck
Thibert, but seemingly not for Steven Wong.

Processes:

1. The code is under svn.
2. The project uses Trac.
3. The project has RFCs covering the PSC and committer guidelines.  A
bit light I must admit.

Release Procedure:

1. The project does not have a codified release procedure.  It does
have established practice which involves beta's and RCs for review,
and a vote before the release is finalized.
2.  The project has a significant regression test ("make check").
3. The processes are not documented though they are part of the
project culture.

Board:

A person has not yet been identified to be the project officer.  I
would suggest the person be Sandro Santilli, and I will discuss this
with the project now.

Marketing:

The project lacks a "quickstart" page or an "application overview" or
a one page flier.  I'm not sure quickstart is applicable since the
project does not have any user facing tools, but at least an overview
is desirable.

The project is included in most binary distributions including OSGeo
Live, UbuntuGIS, and OSGeo4W.

Projects:

The GEOS project has good links to GDAL/OGR, PostGIS, Ingres, and
MapServer projects primarily in the form of common developers.

SAC:

The project is hosted at OSGeo, in the geos.osgeo.org domain and makes
good use of SAC support.


I would note I had imagined the check list being something that the
mentor would review before recommending a project for graduation, and
that incubation committee members would take into account when voting.
 I was not expecting that a detailed report against the items would be
expected from the mentor or project.

Agreed, this is a deficiency worth rectifying.

I've no problem taking the role, altough I don't like bureaucracy that much.

So, +0 here for me as chair. As per RFC1 it takes +2 (and no -1) to go.
Martin, Howard, Gary, Dale and Paul: cast your votes please.

Cameron,

It is my opinion that it is sufficient for the project to accept the task of
writing a project overview.  I would be willing to commit to doing this
for the project.

There is a motion on the table, and if you feel that not currently
having the project overview is sufficient grounds to hold up
graduation it would be appropriate for you to vote -1 with an
explanation to hold things up.  I am not; however, going to
withdraw the motion over this issue as I don't feel it is blocking.

Once again, it had not been my expectation that we were supposed
to provide in-advance answers to the checklist - that a completed
incubation status report like:

  http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GEOS_Incubation_Status

is what is expected.  If we want specific answers to everything in
the checklist then it should be added to the status template.  I
continue to see the checklist as something mentors and
incubation committee members should be reviewing when
considering a project for graduation - and that might prompt
specific questions.  Many of my answers were already covered
in the status document for instance.

Perhaps, but that is certainly a new process and I don't
think it should be assumed.

I have filed a ticket to this effect, and will try to do it this weekend.

  http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/520

I have also become convinced that a small developer introduction for
developers using GEOS would be a big asset for the project and I
might take a crack at that too.

So only Gary's vote is left.

If I'm not mistaken the last time Gary wrote on this list was to vote
on RFC1 in 2008. 

According to RFC1 the lack of communication from a member for a period
of two months allows the committee to consider the position vacant.

Gary: are you reading this ?

Strk,

I'd note that it is sufficient to get two positive votes, and no negative
votes for motions within two business days so I think this motion is
passed.  Perhaps you could update the PSC listing and other relevant
locations to indicate you are project chair.

The project has selected Sandro Santilli as project liason and chair.

I made a start on it this weekend and hope to finish soon.

I will note that so far only Jody has explicitly supported the motion.
I'll add my +1 and make another call for other members of the committee
to vote.  I'd like a more convincing sense of the opinion of the committee
before closing the motion!

Alright, following the RFC this is the mail declaring the motion
passed, giving myself the chair role.

Will update the listing.

Comment(by esseffe):

 interesting to notice (and may be related to this ticket someway).
 the Windows own runtime (printf) represents NaN-values in a completely
 different way ("1.#QNAN", "-1.#INF") from the one adopted on linux
 ("nan").
 please see: http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3576

 that's not only: I noticed an odd inconsistency affecting some math
 C-APIs between 32 and 64 bit implementations on Win, e.g.:

 {{{
 MinGW32
 -------------------------
 p = pow(0, -3.6)
 errno=34 [ERANGE, exactly as on Linux]
 fpclassify(p)=1280 [FP_INFINITE]
 }}}


 {{{
 MinGW64
 -------------------------
 p = pow(0, -3.6)
 errno=0 [no error !!!!!!]
 fpclassify(p)=1280 [FP_INFINITE]
 }}}

 anyway fpclassify() isn't natively supported by the Windows own runtime;
 it looks much more consistent and robust relying on win-specific
 _spclass()
 instead (and useful to support MSVC as well, not only MinGW).

 bye Sandro

------------------------+---------------------------------------------------
 In QGIS, I used the ftools "intersect" geoprocessing tool and got
 unexpected results. It collected only those shapes that are entirely
 within the intersecting shape but missed shapes that are partially inside
 and partially outside of the intersecting shape.

 Below is an example using QGIS 1.7.4:

 Example: Using TIGER line shapefiles (downloaded from
 http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tgrshp2011/tgrshp2011.html), I do the
 following:

 1. Create a new QGIS project, and add shapefiles for Illinois "Places"
 (i.e. cities) and for Illinois "Counties".
 2. Select Cook County in the Counties shapefile.
 3. Open the window for vector:geoprocessing tools:intersect
 4. Specify Places as the Input vector layer (do not mark "use only
 selected features")
 5. Specify Counties as the Intersect layer (mark "use only selected
 features").

 My expectation is that the result set will contain all of the places
 (cities) that are partially or entirely within Cook County, IL. However,
 the result set contains only those places (cities) that are entirely
 within Cook County. Those places that are only partially inside of Cook
 County are missing. For example, the City of Chicago, of which 99% is in
 Cook County is missing from the result set as are a number of other
 places/cities.

 The version of ftools is 0.6.1 (appears to be the most recent). I do not
 know what version of GEOS is being used.

 Doesn't ftools have its own bug tracker or mailing list ?
 Show one pair of geometries against which GEOSIntersect call fail for a

Subject: [geos-devel] Expose Extract Line
Message-ID: <CAGyPVTsvq_5GVLoN8rWDcaBhaP+LP=Ow0qYUR1GP=fDttQGbkw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello GEOS guys and gals!

I would like to request that the Extract Line by Location function (
http://geos.osgeo.org/doxygen/classgeos_1_1linearref_1_1ExtractLineByLocation.html)
to
be exposed in geos public API.

What is the work involved in doing so? Can anyone point me to an example
that I might try to code it? Or there are problems associated with exposing
this function?

I'm using django and python, but my guess is that I'm not the only one
interested, as I've seen others needing it.

I adapted a django geos api solution, but if GEOS exposed this natively, it
would be much better.

Thoughts? Comments?

 Two valid lines trigger a topology exception on union or difference (and
 probably on any other overlay operation).

 Here they are:

1. file an enhancement ticket ( for milestone 3.4.0 )
2. write the function signature in capi/geos_c.h
3. prepare a testcase 
4. write the code in capi/geos_ts_c.cpp
5. write a wrapper in capi/geos_c.cpp
6. refine the testcase :)
7. attach a patch to the ticket.

Anything in capi/geos_ts_c.cpp

> Or there are problems associated with exposing this function?

I guess you'd also need a function to compute locations ?

 It basically tells us that the "Common bits removal" heuristic did succeed
 in give a result, BUT such result is invalid due to self-intersection.

 When it comes to the "Snap" heuristic snapping itself creates invalid
 results.

Comment(by strk):

 The inputs are a larger polygon (first) and a very narrow polygon almost
 collapsed to a line which intersects with the former.

 Areas:
 {{{
      839.745285423078
  3.86746841149477e-14
 }}}

 Overlay with original input fails: TopologyException: found non-noded
 intersection between LINESTRING (1.72506e+06 4.81909e+06, 1.72506e+06
 4.81909e+06) and LINESTRING (1.72506e+06 4.81909e+06, 1.72506e+06
 4.81909e+06) at 1725064.1365604463 4819094.70235069

 Common-bits remover result is refused due to invalidity of the output.

 Snap heuristic is accepted no matter invalidity of the output.
 Invalidity is (in both cases): Self-intersection at or near point
 1725064.1365604463 4819094.70235069 (1725064.1365604463499
 4819094.7023506900296)

 I guess it'd make more sense to throw a TopologyException on invalid
 output.. but that's really something that shouldn't happen.

Comment:

 I've tested JTS which also fails. Not easy to tell because JTS testrunner
 doesn't check output for validity, but it succeeds in returning the
 invalid geometry as result.

 Mind you: the attached testcase works with JTS but has an unsupported

Comment:

 Ok, false alarm.
 According to the Mod2BoundaryNodeRule the input MultiLinestring has no
 boundary, which explains
 the lack of boundary-boundary intersection.

Comment:

 Alright my WKT wasn't correctly noded.
 The nodes are (4,0), (4,3) and (6,0).
 Passing correctly noded input gives the correct answer, which is the
 "A"-looking polygon,
 the polygon covering the southbound triangle hole and the polygon covering
 the small northbound triangle at the bottom.

 {{{
  GEOMETRYCOLLECTION(POLYGON((4 0,0 0,5 10,10 0,6 0,5 3,4 0),(5 3,6 6,4 6,5
