One person, myself.

No. I'll shut down Gutter room.

Have fun yourself.

I'm going to ignore .editorconfig and will keep editing as I've been doing
it since day one of style mess. I'll follow style of immediate surrounding
lines.

Sure, but makes communications *really* annoying. I just thought to
point that out in case your MUA doesn't make the quoting mistake evident
to you.

NOTE: I've been researching about this issue with another person I know
      from which I didn't expect bad quoting and he told me he recently
      started to use the gmail app on a mobile (just in case you're also
      affected by the same bug).

> No. I'll shut down Gutter room.

That's even better, anyway the bridge is now active (just in case
anyone else will join the Gitter room - if possible at all).

Yes, I use GMail and I'm not going to stop using it. You will forgive this
handful of responses I make from mobile.

Feel free to ignore my broken messages.

Given 2 positive votes and no vetos over a period of 2 working days
I declare the proposal ACCEPTED by the PSC (somewhat reduced in
responsiveness, but that's to be dealt with another time).

Mateusz: dunno if you want to update its status to be "accepted"

Comment (by strk):

 So this looks like being the last thing to do before we can switch GEOS
 code to GIT.
 But I realize how to do this depends on where the GIT repository will
 reside.
 If it'll be managed by Gogs/Gitea then hooks should also need to be
 managed that way, otherwise it'll need to be done manually. In any case
 it's useful to have an OSGeo wide hook to send commit mails from git
 hooks, so I think that's what this ticket is about...

I'd rather wait for more votes than two.

If no more votes arrive, I'll mark the RFC 5 as referred or withdrawn.

You might have noticed that PSC has not been very active, lately, so
I would not wait for those votes to arrive.

It's good to keep it open for more comments but I see no reason to
withdraw the proposal.

Any answer ?
Or are them too busy handling the load of money thrown by
restrictive software license owners to friendly packages ?

I guess my two cents are requested because of the explicit CC.

The compiler requirements may be an issue for OSGeo-Live and/or
UbuntuGIS, the toolchain in Ubuntu xenial as used by OSGeo-Live should
be recent enough but I haven't verified this. If that's the case it may
just block UbuntuGIS builds for the older LTS releases (i.e. trusty).
Older Ubuntu LTS releases shouldn't be considered a blocker, those users
are encouraged to upgrade to the latest LTS if they need a newer GEOS.

Kind Regards,

No idea where the CC comes from.

There is ppa: for trusty and older.

AFAIK, QGIS has used C++11 features since mid of 2015
and it is included in OSGeo Live.

I guess I'm still on the PSC...

I'm +1, but I too would note that range-based for loops don't work in MSVC 2013. PDAL uses C++11 throughout, but we avoid range-based for loops and range initializers to be able to support MSVC 2013.

 I've manually installed a post-receive hook for the GEOS repo, we'll know

Thanks Howard.

Hmm, I'm not sure it's clear to me - I've not noticed any problem there.
Range-based statement should work pretty well in VS2013, even in VS2012:

I'm sorry, I meant array initializers. There's a few gotchas with 2013 that were all cleaned up in 2015.

It's reasonable in my mind to say GEOS only supports C++11 -compliant compilers from version X.xx going forward. GDAL is also starting to have this discussion more seriously, and it is a matter of time before some of the foundational libraries like GDAL and GEOS jump toward C++11.

Right, I gotcha.

Thank you Sandro, thanks to All involved for the feedback.

I marked RFC 5 <https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/RFC5>
as Accepted.

I'm going to work towards implementation of the C++11 mode,
including CI builds coverage using on Travis CI and AppVeyor,
using minimal required versions of compilers.

FYI, RFC 4 <https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/wiki/RFC4> proposal
has been dropped due to lack of consensus:

- no PSC or community wide feedback received.

- only feedback provided was by Sandro;
Sandro clearly stated his objection to any style reformatting of the current
codebase (eg. due to log clutter and post-reformat svn/git blame issues).

- it is preferred to cultivate the status quo, apparently

 It looks to me things are ready for the long jump. Next stop: turn SVN as

Subject: [geos-devel] Ready to switch from SVN to GIT ?
Message-ID: <20170404100317.GA6598@localhost>

I think we're finally ready to move the official repository
from SVN to GIT, after dealing with the known issues in
ticket https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/792

What would need to be done next is:

 - Set SVN repository as read-only
 - Ask developers to push new changes to "the" GIT repo

NOTE that only the code repository would change, while issues
milestone and wiki will still be kept under trac, which is
already giving read access to a GIT repository (currently
being a mirror) and is parsing the git commit logs to automatically
comment or close tickets.

* So now which GIT repo ? *

At the moment the GIT repository tracked by Trac is the one
managed by Gogs.

Gogs does not read group permissions from LDAP, but provides an
UI for organization owners to add/remove members from the team.

At this moment the "Owners" team of the "geos" organization
is composed by me and Regina (of PSC) and Mateusz. Owners have
full access to all repositories in the organization (we have 6
of them right now, some of which are private). Another team
is the "php-geos-developers" one composed by myself and "darkpanda"
who have write access to the php-geos repository.

In order to move the official code under Gogs we'll need to reflect
current roles in the project, which means getting all PSC members
in the owners team and giving committers push access to the repository,
but this can be done only once the users actually log into the system
at least once.

I'll give some time to PSC members to react to this and state whether
they agree on the move or what alternative they suggest.

I'm not a PSC member, but I have done a bit of recent porting from JTS.

I would also prefer hosting with GitHub.

Especially lately, it is difficult to create an OSGeo account and I think
this may discourage participation.

Indeed.

Alternatives like gogs/gitea are either close-to-inactive very young projects.
Feature-wise, as long as GitHub is there, it is no-brainer choice for an OSS.
IMHO, reasonable alternative is GitLab, seems it didn't catch much
appreciation in OSGeo due to, AFAIU, its not-so-kosher open core model.

Mat,

Can you state things you like about github over gogs.  I feel like I don't commit enough to have authority on the matter and so your opinion should matter more.

I don't know why it bugs me so much about reliance on GitHub, but it does.  Perhaps because I feel it's a free lunch that may not be so free in the future
And also I don't like that policies may be pushed down on us that we don't necessarily want and that the incentive structure of GitHub is not necessarily aligned with our own and may even change based on environmental economics.

Then again I understand that maintaining an infrastructure like Gogs requires someone willing to do it or get paid for it, so that's even less of a free lunch but does give us more control over 
our destiny and how we integrate with other pieces of our infrastructure.

Just my 2 cents.

Thanks,
Regina

Dan,

 

Thanks for your input.  Those are good concerns to consider.

 

Didn't read your note before I replied to Mat's.

 

I'm still bugged by all this github love, but that's perhaps more of an emotional reaction than a pragmatic one.

 

So I'm torn.

 

 

Thanks,

Regina

We have been discussing it over and over countless of times, with
Sandro and some other OSGeo admins, on IRC especially.
I see no point in debating GitHub vs alternatives, listing and ranking
features, detaioling costs, arguing ethics & politics,
down to manpower and resources required for self-hosting as well as
in-house development of gogs/gitea extras, etc.
Polluting this thread with round N of such debate does not sound interesting.

I just suggested to use GitHub and indicated my judgement is purely
based on features, services, integrations
and overall completeness of software development hosting.
As long as GitHub is alive, online and freely available for OSS, it is
hard to practically and economically justify any alternative.

If GitHub dies, then you can migrate wherever you desire.
Meanwhile, doomsday prep is still only for the super-rich.

At the moment, do you really need more control?

Fact is, GEOS (OSGeo projects, 21 in 22 [1] projects) has already put
its roots down the GitHub ecosystem
that if anything dies (like Travis CI or AppVeyor), it will require
lots of work to migrate/replicate.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not GitHub advocate. I love/hate GitHub (tm [1]).
At the same time, I admit, I can't comprehend the resistance.
we use 90% of the surrounding services, but we die hard to not to say
the final "Yes, I do" :-)

I'm also a contrarian.  The main reason for being a contrarian is if everyone is going one way, it's always nice to have someone go the other way, just in case there is a wolf on the other side. :)

So when Github  or AppVeyor or Travis CI fails (which I think there is a good chance of at least one failing),  you'll have an infrastructure ready for you to migrate to or augment what you have.
I don't think that's a bad thing.  The only question is if anyone is willing to put in that effort.  I think strk is.

So that said, if strk is willing to support Gogs, I'm still a + 1 for Gogs, and just mirror to GitHub similar to what PostgreSQL group does.
That will also satisfy some purists who don't want to use GitHub.

As a core maintainer, does it really matter so much to you whether you make your commits to Gogs or Github? In the end, it's git all the way down.
Only thing is accepting pull requests, but much of that is just the testing which mirroring takes care of anyway and I'm old-fashioned. 
I always like to test things locally before I accept a pull.

If Gogs fails I think it's more trivial of an exercise to migrate to GitHub than the other way around.  


Thanks,
Regina

Those are good reasons.  Basically, I think Free Software projects
should have hosting provided by a charitable organization with Free
Software among its missions.

I am really unclear on the troubles with people getting osgeo accounts
(have had one for years), but it seems that if that's a reason to use a
proprietary hosting service then it's better to fix the problem.

You need to get a mantra (request a token from an admin) to create an
account, this is a significant barrier for users who want to contribute
to OSGeo projects, especially when it's just a simple patch or bug report.

And, as one of mantra requests processing admins, I can only confirm users
do get annoyed and often share comments how annoying it is.

Greg, most OSGeo projects have de facto switched to GitHub:

8 in 22 use OSGeo SVN
6 in 22 use OSGeo Track
21 in 22 use GitHub

It somewhat indicates preferences among OSGeo​ developers. Reasons are
unclear to me, or they are purely based on my interpretation of the facts.

We already have mirrors both on github.com and gitlab.com, this should
be enough to not keep away any contributor (and indeed we do are merging
pull requests opened on those infrastructure).

I'm willing to support Gogs (and probbaly Gitea in the future, which
is quickly advancing feature and stability wise).

Or to GitLab (one of the GitLab Inc. engeneers is part of the Gitea
development team...).

Hi,

What is the benefit of having own GitHub organization?

In the spirit of community re-integration, wouldn't it be better to merge
into github.com/OSGeo/GEOS ?

As long as my github user can still force-push to the `geos` and `php-geos`
repositories I don't have a problem with that, other than the effort of
updating all the remotes (can github do this by itself?) and the wiki page
(can github keep a redirect?).

If you can do all of the above transparently, please go ahead.

Note that for its nature, the mirror repository needs to have issues
and ideally wiki off (not sure this is possible, on github).

AFAIK, it's not possible.

I have created new team to manage access privs:

Next, I'd like to transfer

https://github.com/libgeos/libgeos -> https://github.com/OSGeo/geos

Do we agree?

Then, the mirror updating scripts will need to be updated.

Could you do that Sandro?

AFAIU, the answer is yes.

After a repository transfer [1]:

- If the transferred repository has any forks, then those forks will
remain associated with the repository after the transfer is complete.
- All links to the previous repository location are automatically
redirected to the new location.

After repository rename [2]:

- In addition to redirecting web traffic, all git clone, git fetch, or
git push operations targeting the previous location will continue to
function as if made on the new location.
- However (...) we strongly recommend updating any existing local
clones to point to the new repository URL.

 I'm a bit confused, are we going to import Trac to gogs tickets and start
 tracking bugs with gogs?

This was the plan since February 2016:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2016-February/007404.html

I actually think it's much less pain this way as:

 1) We don't have to migrate all tickets
 2) We don't have to migrate wiki
 3) I can keep replying to trac tickets by mail
    (https://strk.kbt.io/blog/2015/11/11/trac-from-mutt/)
 4) We get proper notifications upon ticket comments
    (Gogs is still short on features with this)
 5) We get spam filtering (lacking in Gogs)

A plan rolling for year(s) is a plan to be ignored/forgotten about.

Is that an obstacle really?
You have already written a tool, haven't you?

>  2) We don't have to migrate wiki

The whole Wiki should be moved to reST/Markdown file sin /docs folder,
easily to browse and read w/ Web,
easy to update (commit or pull request if one doesn't have access).

We already have to maintain README.md and Wiki...

Grr! I had been proposing switch to GitHub to save us a lot of time,
and things actually done/working .

Well, I hadn't forgotten. It's easy to upvote a proposal, not as easy
to put it in practice. It took that much time for me.

I did, but it looses references to actors doing the changes
unless they all already logged at least once in Gogs.

I suggest looking for a Trac plugin to make that possible to do
incrementally. Or you could contribute to the 
migration tool to also import wiki:
http://strk.kbt.io/projects/go/trac2gogs/

You can save a lot of time by not doing any migration
(as we're doing now). Let me know what makes you waste
time while working with Trac, so maybe we can improve that.

As you know, I am going to try automate the process.
Hence my request in https://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo/ticket/1903

No, I don't plan to import/export Wiki.
The Wiki needs to be moved manually into flat files as docs.
In terms of collaborative writing, there is no difference between Wiki vs Git.
In terms of docs disintegration, the difference is clear. Wiki should go
or be used exclusively as scratchpad.

Once that is done, we can think of re-building GEOS website
with proper docs, etc. (see PROJ.4, PDAL as examples).

The GitHub vs others debate is a waste of time,
we choose the latter gaining zero technological advantage.

Anyhow, I am going to use GitHub (and PRs) as the primary
channel for commits, to allow myself the advantage of pre-factum CI..

Pre-factum CI is currently also available via Gogs, although more
convoluted (it takes explicitly adding your fork to the drone install,
and then to link the badge to the PR summary).

NOTE: I know your answer to the above question will likely be NO, because
you prefer to use external working infrastructure, but I'll keep asking
everyone in the hope to find somebody willing to help with improving the
available infrastructural free software out there :)

We are, however, turning away bug reports from users of this
infrastructure.  I wonder if we should keep the "Issues" channel open until
the OSGeo account registration system is functional.

GEOS trac system has currently 124 open tickets.
I don't think we are lacking bug reports.
Fixes are welcome, and easy to provide on all channels
(trac, github, gitlab, gogs, mailing list).

List of open tickets:
https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/report/1

PS: OSGeo account registration *is* functional, just takes some human
    interaction, which may be seen as an obstacle by those who want
    to file a complain and forget about it but might not be so bad for
    those who intend to followup until the issue is addressed.

Why do you see wiki destruction is neede to start GEOS website ?
I think it's a great idea to build that website now, are you
volunteering for a first draft ?

Convoluted, indeed.

Drone is rather an interesting addition, not something to rely on, from my POV.
It does not support builds on Windows. I'm not even sure it supports
builds on OS X.
(I mean 'guest' OS, not host).

If I had more/too much time/money, I might have considered it.
Tiny projects like GEOS, non-profits like OSGeo simply
can not afford investment in developing its infrastructure at low-level.
What's next, burning our own CPUs because Intel and AMD are proprietary?

I'll repeat myself, GitHub-based ecosystem is the only cost-effective solution
available for not-so-rich non-profits.
IMHO, GitLab with GitLab CI with its shared runners is the only
sensible alternative.
but still it will require lots of admin investment.

We have Jenkins building GEOS on Windows, that's another research topic.
There is a Jenkins Gogs plugin which wasn't installed last time I checked.

I asked you in particular, and I'll keep asking each developer
partecipating in a free software project community. It's something
some people enjoy doing, because maybe they think they could use
the investiment they make in the future (effectively using the software
or just the skills built improving it).

It really depends on what's the effect you want to obtain.
And what is the problem you're seeking a solution for.
This mailing list is about development of GEOS. Do you think we
have an infrastructural problem *blocking* the development ?
Honestly, I don't think that's the case.
There are currently 6 pending pull requests on github:
https://github.com/OSGeo/geos/pulls
One of them has a green CI and is pending since April 11, 2015.

> IMHO, GitLab with GitLab CI with its shared runners is the only

We don't need to pick one, as you can see.
We're using all of them: github.com, gitlab.com, git.osgeo.org/gitlab
and git.osgeo.org/gogs. Decide where to focus and invest your time !

Here are my thoughts mostly in-line with strk and speaking from my selfish point of view.

Drone is just one option of many and we don't need to choose just one.

>From my POV, I'm a windows packager and I like to have the packages (test builds) built automatically with each run of PostGIS / pgRouting GEOS / eventually GDAL (though this I just build at the end except on debbie which tests each change).

Github won't do this for me.  This is getting to why I need more control than what github provides and support the Jenkins buildbots.  Those do more than testing, they make builds.
As I recall I think QGIS has similar needs.  I'm not sure how they handle that currently.  And if you are going to make an experimental build, it's kind of part of the process you end up testing what you are building.

Yap that's the next step.

I think the problem to focus on here, is why we don't have more investment in OSGeo to support this and other things if so many companies are relying on our work.
Should we hit up on Amazon for example, who from what I learned on PostgreSQL conference provides buildbots to PostgreSQL project.  Since PostGIS now is a big selling point for Amazon (and now Google PostgreSQL also supports PostGIS) and PostGIS relies on GEOS and GDAL, sounds like we can get some bite there for first PostGIS then GEOS and GDAL.

Rather than accepting the status quo and saying we're too poor let's just use GitHub. Let's ask how can we be better at marketing and asking for money or infrastructure?
We are too focused on doing software development on a shoe-string budget and not asking enough of WHY DO WE HAVE TO WORK THIS WAY? 

As I already mentioned GitHub doesn't satisfy all my needs.  I'd like to for example test on other OS like FreeBSD, CentOS
And I even have dreams of having pre-compiled builds for these people to increase the number of people testing things out for us.

This is not something I see GitHub or Travis or AppVeyor doing for us.  They are simply for testing not for creating builds that brave users who don't know how to compile
can start using and stress testing.

I concur with strk.  For my purposes making sure things are ready at time I need to distribute is most important to me.  The more environments we have for testing the better.

Does it have multiple Visual Studio versions (2013, 2015, 2017), MinGW?
Is it configurable it with single file in git repo?

Those should be considered side interests, outside of GEOS (OSGeo et al) scope.

Yes, and I apologies the discussion overlaps general OSGeo,
but in this particular case both are very tightly coupled.

Inconveniences, even small, non-blocking ones, can easily become PITA.
Again, I do, kind of, speak up my opinion in the general OSGeo scope.

I will risk opinion it might have been merged sooner, if git was there earlier.

Since PostGIS now is a big selling point for Amazon (and now Google PostgreSQL also supports PostGIS) and PostGIS relies on GEOS and GDAL, sounds like we can get some bite there for first PostGIS then GEOS and GDAL.

This is a great idea. Asking them to donate build services would be
a good start.

I don't know how easy it would be to setup Jenkins slave (I think I
asked in the past) nor I know if they can be for testing on
FreeBSD/OpenBSD/Hurd/Solaris/etc.

For Drone setting up a slave is pretty much running a docker container,
but that implies having a single setup being tested. But on the other hand
a (set of) drone slaves would be up to run/test any project (and PR)
registered on Gogs/OSGeo.

Having them provide my beloved and missed Buildbot would be even better !

Do you have a contact there for asking ?

Shortly, because OSGeo projects do not need it: GitHub+CIs work for them well.
The projects even don't bother to analyse their needs and consider
simple question: "What are pros/cons of OSGeo infrastructure, shall we
stay?".
We've been trying for, correct me if I'm wrong, years now, asking
question: "What you need, how can we make you happ(y|ier)?" and nobody
comes back with answers!
They simply move their processes outside, quietly.

OSGeo sponsors are needed to scale up on GitHub, Travis CI and
AppVeyor, negotiate discounts and pay for the deals.
If GitHub+CIs dies, then shift money to NKOTB. If none available, then
consider self-hosting. Before that happens, we are YAGNI'ing, wasting
efforts and money.

It's not "poor? go to GitHub". I'm certain, OSGeo would have to start
paying, but I'm fairly sure the monies, even if bigger would deliver
better experience.
"If OSGeo offered you access to paid {GitHub|BitBucket}+{Travis
CI|BitBucket Pipelines}+AppVeyor , would it make your project
happier?" - Shall we poll OSGeo folks :-)

Another problem w/ maintaining OSGeo-hosted infrastructure is lack of
admins even remotely interested in getting a contract.
Year ago Sandro, if I'm correct, pioneered sysadmins contracting for
OSGeo (https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/sac/2016-May/007032.html).
Year later... I have expected there would be more (actually, a lot)
people within OSGeo community interested in hugging 5000 EUR for 50
hours job.
Sandro has done great job, he's also shown the value of sysadmins,
capacity of OSGeo budget in action, but we need Sandro x 5 at least.

Nobody has come forward really. Why? I think we know :-)

Travis CI and Docker can do it for you.

Again, no problem (eg. https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/packagecloud/)
Those services are usually referred as CI, but they cover CD (cont.
depoyment/delivery) too.

OK.
As I mentioned, I also found my way through.

As a side project, sure, great.
As a large non-profit org, that is unnecessary distraction.

The only reason I keep arguing about external infrastructure is because,
from POV of development workflow and practice, no arguments have ever been
presented, here or OSGeo lists, that prove self-hosting is an
advantage for OSGeo.
I'd love to see one, so I can finally shut my mouth up :-)

At this very moment "Dronie" is the only green badge we have here:
https://trac.osgeo.org/geos/

But as Travis is also green in the README.md of trunk maybe the
wiki suffered by the move of GitHub URL.
Could you please fix that ?

This is the first I'm hearing of this.  So my reason would be not lack of interest but because it wasn't offered as an option.
How many people in OSGeo community even know about such an offer?

I'm not sure how many others are in the same boat.

That said I only work for free on projects I contribute to and/or am emotionally attached to.  If it helps OSGeo that's good. 
If I'm getting paid for it to ensure it helps OSGeo, then I'd happily do it.

Thanks,
Regina

I would find it to be a peculiar request if a project asked my company for
financial resources so that they could attempt to replicate infrastructure
that is already offered to the project in-kind by other organizations.

I support asking commercial users to assist the project and the foundation,
but I think that assistance would be best directed at the core mission of
the project, which is to offer the complete functionality of JTS in C++.
As you pointed out, GEOS has many open bug reports.  Corporate sponsorship,
either in the form of sponsored bug fixes or donated developer time, could
be very beneficial in reducing this.

It was offered on the SAC list to give SAC members priority on taking
the offer (due to the voluntary service they gave to OSGeo already).

Given the lack of response (it was proposed 2 times and both times I
was the only candidate) next time it could be *also* offered on the
wider osgeo-discuss list.

Note that even sending out the call-for-interest requires an effort,
and I also happened to have taken that effort for those 2 cases.
If you want to lead the next call, I'm really looking forward to it
because there are some critical things that would be great to see
addressed (like making the Wiki use the LDAP accounts rather than
having its own users database, completing the last infrastructure
transition etc.)

I suggest you join the SAC mailing list and state your interest in
the activities. I'd really love to see the SAC team grow !

Subject: [geos-devel] Breeding .editorconfig is bad
Message-ID: <CABUeae_R38me9ZZ98nT_du+JSLP2EEdV+WAhjGywaMpAuDi4Gg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Recently, I've been arguing with Sandro, that breeding .editorconfig
file per folder is a bad idea.

The rationale was this:
- if files in a directory use different (en)coding style than the one
specified in .editorconfig,
- then, create .editorconfig in such directory with settings matching
the style of directory.
Purpose of that was to automate cultivation of the current mixture of
code formatting/styles.

I objected this practice and tried to avoid the multitude of .editorconfig's
Often, single file contains bits in styles and such scoped .editorconfig
will lead to commits mixing actual (logic/behaviour) code change
with code formatting changes. Unacceptable!

See the problem in action here:

https://github.com/OSGeo/geos/pull/81/files

My call, again, is to stop it and get rid of any spaces/indentation settings
in .editorconfig for as long as we don't get the code reformatted into
desired style.
Alternatively, please, make your editors ignore .editorconfig completely
and manually align with coding style as presented in actual file being edited.
That's what I'm going to do.

Best regards,

Sandro, we certainly are free to activate ourselves in whatever areas
we like, but,
approach based on suggesting/requesting to join SAC and join admin efforts
or join gogs/gitea and contribute, whenever someone expresses interest or
makes a feature request to SAC is not an acceptable policy.

Although I perfectly understand (and often agree with) your motivation,
such attitude will make more harm than good.
It certainly won't help to justify self-hosted OSGeo infrastructure to
the Community.

Why not ?
OSGeo is a non-profit organization walking on the legs of its members.
I find it perfectly acceptable to stimulate partecipation.

Of course self-hosted means more responsibility in maintainance (either
in form of dedicated time or money). I've no intention to hide that.

Note that the Gogs service and the associated Drone deploys have been
setup by myself in my own time, as a volunteer. No OSGeo budget was
used for that. Can it be sustainable in the long run ? It depends on
how many more people will want to help keeping the service going. As
I'd really like for that service to continue, I campaign for growing
the volunteers base. I think this is perfectably acceptable.

I agree it is unacceptable to mix logic and style changes in
the same commit.

Also and I think we should minimize style changes as much as possible,
which was the rationale for my adding per-directory .editorconfig.

Could you briefly explain the problem we're seeing there ?
Is it the removal of trailing blank spaces ?

The way I've been addressing those cases has been first committing
removal of trailing blank spaces and then committing a separate
funtional change.

If the problem is the one I described above there's no "pre-existing
coding style" to be preserved. It's just that someone added too many
blanks at the end of lines.

Note that `git diff --check` can do the trailing blanks check for you
before it's committed.

Please do not ignore .editorconfig as it's aimed to *reducing* the
proliferation of code styles. I've run a check under src/ and include/
some days ago and found that only a single file is not using tabs
(namely the CLocalizer class files introduced by Sean Gillies in 2008)

Because the stimulation has already reached level of annoyance.

If developers of OSGeo projects are being pulled down every time they
pass trenches of SAC,
they will quickly change routes and solve their admin problems
differently (eg. moving out).

Majority of the community members are perfectly aware who and what drives OSGeo
and if anyone has time, experience/knowledge and will to volunteer,
they do/will help. If nobody shows up, despite the clear advertisement
(ei. foundation/about.html, foundation_faq.html, wiki/Volunteers_Needed),
it means nobody can or want to help.

> As I'd really like for that service to continue, I campaign for growing
> the volunteers base.
> I think this is perfectably acceptable.

Forgive me, but it's long no longer a campaign, but delegating and
setting obstacles.
Starting with mantra case, I have received at least 4-5
close-to-unpleasant comments like
you want me to read the instructions? First, stop making it so
difficult to submit a bug report.
Second case, where is the Trac XML RPC plug-in I asked to install, I
asked who to ask,
next I'm going to ask who to found a bounty, shall I?
Mind you, I need the plug-in to actually do **volunteer** for OSGeo?
Mind you, no coordinators, SAC PSC members, nobody answered even
basic: Sorry, no manpower, can't be done.
That is Catch 22!

If there is nobody to admin OSGeo infrastructure, then OSGeo should
not run any infrastructure.

Keeping to annoy people won't solve anything for us.

I've tried removing all trailing blanks from .cpp and .h files
across the whole geos codebase, to get a feel of what it would
take.

The change summary is:

 753 files changed, 3219 insertions(+), 3219 deletions(-)

That's over a total of 156972 lines in 839 files, so 2% of the lines
in 90% of the files have trailing blanks.

Full change stats: http://strk.kbt.io/tmp/trailing-blanks.txt

I think 2% might be an acceptable loss for git-blame, what do you
think ? And we could then add a step in "make check" to make sure
no trailing blanks get back in the codebase.

Opinions ?

Mind you, I did not apply any of the style changes.
The .editorconfig-driven editor did.

Are you being serious?
I rename a variable, editor reformats 100-s of LOCs on save, then you ask to
stash/revert-fiddle with my change, commit the style, then re-apply my change
and make separate commit?

First, tell me it's a joke.
Second, despite your objection to the RFC4, you do agree to apply big reformats.

No, it's just there was freedom of styles from day one.
You also fiddled with 4 spaces, 2 spaces, then switched to tabs.
The current style is mixture.

You do not listen. The code styles has been proliferating for decade+,
it is there.

I understand you refuse to use clang-format, but I can't understand why
you agree on .editorconfig to sneak style reformats.
Let's leave things as they are, do nothing.

Addendum: removing trailing *tabs* the numbers raised to:

   753 files changed, 3676 insertions(+), 3676 deletions(-)

That's still 2% lines in 90% of files though.

Yes I know. It's annoying for me too, see separate thread
for a proposed solution.

My objections were regarding possibility to *maintain* the style.
In the separate thread you see the "big" reformat is actually only
touching 2% of the lines.

> Let's leave things as they are, do nothing.

This is another possibility, yes. We could drop the
removal of trailing spaces. But I've ready the 2% reformat
and the hook on "make check" to ensure they are not re-introduced.

Uhm, then I guess I need better tools to detect.
Tabs are not being a problem on editorconfig-aware editors, right ?

 Only attempt to fix self-intersection between multiple components

 Doing this reduces the likelyhood of entering an infinite recursion
 whereas UnaryUnion (meant to fix that) would enter the self-intersection
 attempt again. Fixes #615 for which a test is added.

 This also gives us back an exception with the input of ticket #488,
 which is the same behavior JTS exposes. The (bogus) test for it
 is disabled by this commit.

 Only attempt to fix self-intersection between multiple components

 Doing this reduces the likelyhood of entering an infinite recursion
 whereas UnaryUnion (meant to fix that) would enter the self-intersection
 attempt again. Fixes #615 for which a test is added.

 This also gives us back an exception with the input of ticket #488,
 which is the same behavior JTS exposes. The (bogus) test for it
 is disabled by this commit.

 Only attempt to fix self-intersection between multiple components

 Doing this reduces the likelyhood of entering an infinite recursion
 whereas UnaryUnion (meant to fix that) would enter the self-intersection
 attempt again. Fixes #615 for which a test is added.

 This also gives us back an exception with the input of ticket #488,
 which is the same behavior JTS exposes. The (bogus) test for it
 is disabled by this commit.

Subject: [geos-devel] Porting polylabel to GEOS and PostGIS
Message-ID: <B46DF2B9-D6B8-461E-8732-1A08A9971EB5@gmail.com>

Hello!

I’d like to make a port of polylabel function (https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel <https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel>) to PostGIS. My goal is to have an ST_PoleOfInaccessibility function in PostGIS, that acts a lot like ST_Centroid or ST_PointOnSurface, but finds the visual center of a polygon.
Since it has a C++ version and GEOS is a major PostGIS dependency, I guess it’s a good fit to port it here.
The problem is this hpp has some dependencies on mapbox bits: geometry.hpp (https://github.com/mapbox/geometry.hpp <https://github.com/mapbox/geometry.hpp>) and variant, which I hope could be substituted with GEOS types.
I haven’t ever looked into GEOS code yet and I’m not perfect at C++ either, so I guess this relatively simple task is a good point to start.
Can someone please provide guides on where to start with this port. 
Is it reasonable to have this code in GEOS, or this has to be done with just plpgsql without touching any dependencies?
Any feedback on this topic is appreciated.

Cheers,
Nick

Hi Nikolai,
I think it's reasonable to have the code in GEOS.

The C++ would could go under src/operation/polylabel
and include/geos/operation/polylabel, with unit tests
under tests/unit/operation/polylabel.

Then you'd expose the functionality in the C-API in
capi/geos_c.h.in (both reentrant and non-reentrant versions,
to ease PostGIS connector) with tests in
tests/unit/capi/GEOSPolylabelTest.cpp (assuming that matches
the C-API function name).

You can check out src/algorithm/CentroidArea.cpp for inspiration,
and you'll have to mark each line with the "Last port: original work"
tag (see src/operation/sharedpaths/SharedPathsOp.cpp for example).

You can publish in-progress code in a pull request in the official
code repository [1] or any mirror to have the state of your work checked
by automated build bots.

It's recommended to file a trac ticket to plan inclusion of the new
code in next version (and reference the trac ticket number in the final
commit log or pull request title).

Feel free to ask more specific question as you move on.

 strk,

 Now that GEOS is on gogs and  we have gogs webhook installed on debbie's
 jenkins,  can we as a firs step, change GEOS jobs to use Gogs web hook.

 Right now it's using polling for running the jobs.

 If that passes, then we can with PostGIS and GEOS investigate testing pull
 requests as well.

 I'm not sure how web-hooks are setup on Gogs so not sure where to start.

 I actually like 5min polling....helps in the odd case where you forget to
 add a new file and then commit again right away.

Comment (by strk):

 To account for the "forgot" case, my own mirroring script waits
 a configurable amount of seconds before starting the mirroring
 process, maybe the jenkins build configuration allows for something
 like that too ? I know for sure Buildbot did have support for that
 kind of building (ie: not all commits, but at a minimum time distance).

 Anyway, it's also useful to test each and every commit
 (and reduce the number of commits by running "make check" locally)

 Seeing this with llvm fuzzing with ASAN and geos 3.5.0.

 Am I doing something wrong with the API or is this a bug with WKTReader
 not cleaning up in the case of an exception?

Comment (by goatbar):

 Sadly, no, https://github.com/OSGeo/geos/pull/83 does not fix the issue.


 source:trunk/src/io/WKTReader.cpp at 4052#L422

 `new vector' is leaked  if there is a throw before return.  I am not sure
 what shape the fix should be.  If this were C++11, putting it in a
 unique_ptr would make sure it was deleted as the stack unwound.  A closer
 class with a delete in the destructor would work too.  Or simplest might
 be to try / catch the exception.  I'm not very experienced with
 exceptions, so I haven't tried catch the exception yet.

 {{{#!c++
 MultiPolygon* WKTReader::readMultiPolygonText(StringTokenizer *tokenizer)
 {
         string nextToken=getNextEmptyOrOpener(tokenizer);
         if (nextToken=="EMPTY") {
                 return geometryFactory->createMultiPolygon(NULL);
         }
         vector<Geometry *> *polygons=new vector<Geometry *>();  // <---
 This is leaked.
         Polygon *polygon=readPolygonText(tokenizer);
         polygons->push_back(polygon);
         nextToken=getNextCloserOrComma(tokenizer);
         while(nextToken==",") {
                 Polygon *polygon=readPolygonText(tokenizer);
                 polygons->push_back(polygon);
                 nextToken=getNextCloserOrComma(tokenizer);
         }
         MultiPolygon *ret = geometryFactory->createMultiPolygon(polygons);
         //for (int i=0; i<polygons->size(); i++) delete (*polygons)[i];
         //delete polygons;
         return ret;
 }
 }}}

 I would guess that every other read method with a new will also leak.

Comment (by mloskot):

 Kurt, this is classic lack of RAII in GEOS which. Switch to C++11 should
 help, replacing auto_ptr with unique_ptr and using unique_ptr in as many
 places as possible.

 In this particular case, `vector<Geometry *> *polygons=new vector<Geometry
 *>(` could be replaced with intermediate vector on stack, once fully
 created, allocate new on heap and move `polygons` data into it before
 passing to `createMultiPolygon`.

 This however is partial fix: it will avoid leaking `polygons = new
 vector<Geometry *>` but won't avoid leaking heap-allocated items of
 `polygons`.

 Long term solution could be switching away from heap-allocated vectors to
 use of rvalues with move semantic.

Comment (by goatbar):

 Working on a proposed simple patch of this form.  I'll have it ready in
 the next day.
 {{{#!c++
         Polygon *polygon = NULL;
         try {
                 polygon=readPolygonText(tokenizer);
         } catch (ParseException const& e) {
                 delete polygons;
                 throw ParseException(e.what());
         }
 }}}
 This happens a number of locations, e.g. multilinestring too.

 mloskot: Agreed, the whole move semantics world will make this a lot
 simple in the long run.

Comment (by goatbar):

 My proposed solution is in https://github.com/OSGeo/geos/pull/84

 It's similar to other methods in the class.  Catching `...` is especially
 important as not all exceptions are `geos::io::ParseException`.   e.g. I
 got a `geos::util::IllegalArgumentException` for a malformed `LinearRing`
 inside a `GeometryCollection`.

 Since changeset:f825b410/git

 It's odd, because the appveyor report on the corresponding PR was fine:

 Any idea, Mat ?

Subject: [geos-devel] Building a small/core version of geos
Message-ID: <CACmBxyvjm8Kw=ULnjX7RSVT+0qT1iwrUnFVZtq6agq2qkK07fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

First off, I'm doing this with bazel as the build system, so I'm not
worried about making sure I don't break the CMake or autoconf builds.

I'm looking to see if I can build a subset of geos with the goal of being
able to just use the io WKT portion of geos with the least amount of the
rest of geos brought in with the core lib.  I then will add the rest of the
geos lib that depends on the core.  Anyone tried that before or have
thoughts on how hard it would be to do that?  e.g. some code would only
need the geometry representation of WKT source and it would be best to pull
in the least amount of other code with it.  That would also make testing of
things like io as light as possible.

I'm going to see what I can remove while still being able to run my tests
that are here:

https://github.com/schwehr/gdal-autotest2/tree/master/cpp/third_party/geos
/io

Thoughts?

Comment (by strk):

 Can you try to add a test under tests/unit/linearref exposing a bad
 consequence of that always-false comparison ? It would be great to
 have the need-for-fix clearly shown and the later fix secured.

Comment (by nila):

 I cannot see the always-false comparison would introduce any bad
 conseqence as such. The code is a pretty straightforward port from JTS
 with the exception of componentIndex and segmentIndex being unsigned here,
 while they are signed in JTS. In JTS the comparisons are needed, but here
 they are redundant. The LinearLocation::normalize can therefore be reduced
 by 11 lines and 2 lines in LinearLocation::isValid can be shortened (and 4
 Clang warnings can be silenced).

Thanks Martin (replying to the list so it's on the record)

Bottom line: it is still fine to port code from JTS to GEOS.
