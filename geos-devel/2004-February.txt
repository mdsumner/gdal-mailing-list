  I have changed the declaration for the
     static const int DEFAULT_QUADRANT_SEGMENTS =6 and two other variables.
It is working fine.

Thanks Hervé

I work with large datasets > 1'000'000 recs in a PostGIS DB. For direct use
with ArcView we need to export these data to ESRI shapefiles with ogr2ogr.
This export works automatically and nightly very stable. Now I'm faced with
the problem that this export doesn't create spatial indexes. Working with
this data in ArcView is very slow. My solution today, I create this indexes
by hand with ArcView every day. 
 
Now I'm looking for a better solution to automate the shape index creation.
I'm appreciative for every hint.

Message-ID: <00e401c3f206$45881e60$e600a8c0@ws02>

Hi, I just downloaded geos tar.gz file and I want to install it into my
RedHat 7.3 box with gcc-2.96.
Anybody kindly can give me step by step instructions to do that? Poor me,
because I don't really familiar with development environment in Linux box.
But, I do really need geos. :(

I have tried these steps:
#aclocal (w/o arguments)
#automake (w/o arguments)
#autoconf (w/o arguments)
#libtool (I'm stuck here.. because I don't know what should I give to it as
arguments)

I try to skip the libtool step and run ./configure and I got this error.
Unfortunately, I absolutely don't understand what the error try to tell me.
:(

I try not to upgrade my RedHat because of hardware limitation and a lot of

Dr. D?ster,

I am unaware of any public definition of the Shapefile index formats.  I took
a peek at it once, and it wasn't completely trivial though I imagine it could
be worked out with sufficient effort.

I think reverse engineering the ESRI spatial index format would be an
interesting project for some geo-programmer with time on their hands, and
access to ArcView.  However, that isn't me at this time, and this list might
not be the best place to try and find such a person.

Isn't there a way of launching ArcView scripts "in batch" as part of your
whole transfer process?

Best regards,

Thank you very much for your response. You are right to mention that this is
not the right place for this subject. I thought that perhaps somebody
reading this list has some experience or ideas for a solution.

So I will take a further look at ESRI ArcView lists.

No answer available. Shape index files are proprietary and no published 
format exists. I do not think anyone has bothered to try and reverse 
engineer them.

Roy, download the RPMs from postgis.refractions.net/rpms
If you do not feel comfortable with compiling, that is by far the best

What version of ArcView are you targetting?

One of the more powerful ways I've found (for external scripting of 
Arcview3) may be to use the AvPython product.
http://avpython.sourceforge.net/ 

Many have confirmed that for Arc9, rudimentary python scripting support 
will be available and bundled with ArcMap!

Darren H. and Tyler
 
Thank you for yor response. I work with ArcView 3.x and tru64 UNIX and I
need index creation on the shape column only.
 
I tried to configure ArcView with a startup script to start the index
creation. After creation of the indexes the script shut down ArcView by
itself. I works from the command promt with av <proj>.apr. The problem, when
I start ArcView form a cronjob without a display, ArcView isn't able to
start up, because it is looking out for a display without success. 
 
I'm not shure if there exists ArcObjects for tru64 UNIX.

Hello Dr. D?ster, 

What operating system and version of ArcView are you using (ArcGIS ArcView
8.x or ArcView 3.x)? 

Do you also need an index built on any of the attribute columns? 

I'm not sure, but I assume something could easily be programmed using
ArcObjects. Get back to me, and if I have time/need a break from dreary
research paper writing, I'll look for a solution.

Thank you, 

Darren H.

What's the SRID handling logic that goes on when I embed functions like:
buffer( box3d ( wkb_geometry ) )
If I'm comparing this with other geometries that initially had the same 
SRID, I find I have to add:
setsrid(buffer( box3d ( wkb_geometry ) ),nnnnnn)
to make it work.  Yet if I only use Buffer or box3d I don't get this 
problem. 

I know my example is a bit weird but bear with me...

Box3d's dont have an SRID.  When they get converted to geometries, they 
have an SRID of -1.  If you do an envelope(<geometry>), you'll get 
something with the same SRID.

The confusing part is that postgis/postgresql will auto-convert types 
for you so you have to be careful.

  buffer( box3d ( wkb_geometry ) )

is probably converting WKB to GEOMETRY to BOX3D to GEOMETRY.

Problem found and "solved".
The version of ltmain in the CVS archive did not match the libtool on 
the build box.
Now that they match, 'make dist' creates a much nicer result, one that 
creates .so files.

Happened with me on Cygwin also. It was the Feb. 10 24:00 MST (Alberta) CVS
check-out.

I have not updated my GEOS on my Linux systems in a while, so I'll do that right
now and get back on that.

This is the corrext behaviour Cygwin should DLLs 
should *not* be adding a .so extension

i.e. Cygwin uses the Win32 DLL mechanisms not the Unix ones

Cheers

This is probably the case as a dll will not be made if there are any undefined
symbols at dll creation time

I tweak the scripts to make dlls for my system but all systems are not setup
the same and I don't have the time or motive to maintain 'official' cygwin packages

I will however continue to support the OpenSource packages I use to the
extent that they work on Cygwin for as long as I continue to use Cygwin
but only through the project's list so that all can benefit

Cheers

Norman

FYI here is a script that can be run from the top proj4 dir to 
create a dll.  note you will have to manually install the resultant
files appropriately

     however THIS IS UNSUPPORTED by me
So don't even bother to ask questions about how to use this
unless you are willing to pay a consultants fee

if you don't understand it search the Cygwin project's lists
or ask your questions there

i.e.
    You are on your own  --  < but this works >

Note you can do similar things with any static library however
you must insure that all references are imported ala the 
-Wl --archive,  -Wl --whole-archive linker directives appropriately
 see the architecture specific man pages for 'ld'

hopefully libtool support for gcc on Win32 will improve in the future
and this will be automated some day

=== cut ===
gcc -shared -o cygproj.dll \
	-Wl,--out-implib=libproj.dll.a \
	-Wl,--export-all-symbols \
	-Wl,--enable-auto-import \
	-Wl,--whole-archive ./src/.libs/libproj.a \
	-Wl,--no-whole-archive /lib/libcygwin.a

Subject: [geos-devel] Memory leak in Polygon::getArea()?
Message-ID: <s03f1261.048@correo.dap.es>

Hi all!

I've downloaded geos-cvs this week and I've found what seems a memory leak. Currently Polygon::getArea() calls LineString::getCoordinates() but that memory is never deleted.

I've changed Polygon::getArea() in the following way

/**
*  Returns the area of this <code>Polygon</code>
*
*@return the area of the polygon
*/
double Polygon::getArea() const {
	double area=0.0;
	CoordinateList *s=shell->getCoordinates();
	area+=fabs(CGAlgorithms::signedArea(s));
	delete s;
	for(unsigned int i=0;i<holes->size();i++) {
	CoordinateList *h=(*holes)[i]->getCoordinates();
                area-=fabs(CGAlgorithms::signedArea(h));
	delete h;
	}
	return area;
}

and it works correctly for me.

Do people here think Geometry should define getCoordinatesRO() returning
a const *CoordinateList which does not need to be deleted even if this
would be slower then the corresponsing explicit copy of getCoordinates()
for anything other then LineString* ? Or instead change Polygon::holes
to a LinearRing vector ? Martin ?

For LineStrings and descendents there is a getCoordinatesRO() function
which returns an read-only pointer to internal structure.
I've changed CGAlgorithms::signedArea signature to accept a
const *CoordinateList and used a call to shell->getCoordinatesRO().

For the holes, this is a bit tricky, because the holes elment of the
polygon object is a vector of Geometry, not LinearRing (even if this
is always the case), and Geometries do not define a getCoordinatesRO()
function. I used your version here ...

Subject: [geos-devel] Ring winding?
In-Reply-To: <20040227183833.A983@freek.keybit.net>
Message-ID: <01e401c3fd77$d7e9dfb0$f400fe0a@TOPP2>


I have a somewhat general question about how GEOS stores its polygons.

In the 'old' GIS style, ala ESRI Shapefile, the polygon consists of a single
set of points, where the exterior ring has a counter-clockwise winding, and
the interior rings have a clockwise winding.  Each ring is also closed
(first point is duplicated as the last) so that mathematically, the entire
set of points can be rendered as a single polygon without knowledge of rings
at all.

In the 'new' OGC style of separate rings, ala JTS/GEOS:
  1. Do the exterior and interior rings still differ in winding?  Or are
they all the same winding?
  2. Is each ring closed with a redundant point?

-Ben
