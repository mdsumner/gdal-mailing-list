Paul,

The CAG seminar slot are listed at
http://csr.uvic.ca/~wendym/cag/f02talks.html

The SEG colloquium is typically on Fridays. The slots for September are
still all open. (http://www.cs.UVic.CA/~sweng/)

Please select dates and I will arrange it with the department.

Jens

It seems to me that our robustness problems in JTS are not exactly in the domain of the Combinatorial Algorithms Group, since they're focussed on combinatorial algorithms rather than Computational Geometry.   Should we check with someone in the group first to see if they're interested in such a talk, and whether there's going to be any potential for collaborative work?

Hausi might have some insight into this, since he's a Comp Geom guy...

Martin,

Let me talk with the group about this.
Don't overestimate the significance of the name "CAG" though.
This group has grown from  historically fairly narrow focus to becoming now
the "theory" group in our department. They do have Computational Geometry
researchers. Maybe you can provide me with an abstract of your application
and I will probe interest and expertise on our side.

(Hausi is on vacation right now.)

Yury, can you give me a call sometime?  I'm having problems building GEOS...

Also, I think it would be a good idea if we can mirror the original package directory structure for the C source code.  Does this make sense to you?

Yury (All):

I am away on holidays until August 19th.  I'm not sure I will be able to check my email during this time, but I will try.  However, that will only be once or twice during the period.

A backup contact for JTS issues is Jon Aquino here at Vivid (385-6040).
