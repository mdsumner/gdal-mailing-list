I'ld like to follow up on these comments from a month or two back.  I've
been looking into the use of curves in polygon operations a bit since then,
for my own purposes. Here's what I've learned.

Most packages use quadratic and cubic Beziers as their basic primitive, but
not higher orders.  More complex curves are usually approximated by
stitching together cubic curves into a path.

Quadratic curves can be easily converted into cubic curves if you don't
want to duplicate code by implementing both quadratic and cubic curves
everywhere.  Some operations that are mathematically exact when done with
quadratic curves cannot be done exactly with cubic curves.

Several operations on cubic curves cannot be done mathematically exactly,
*but* the approximations available are so close that they are acceptable in
almost all real-world circumstances.

Circles and arcs can be represented very accurately by Bezier
approximations.  Consequently so can ellipses.

Any single Bezier curve can be easily split into two adjoining Bezier
curves.

Flattening a curve to line segments (or even individual pixels on a raster
display) is trivial.  Reversing a flattened curve, even after
transformations and clipping, back to its Bezier representation, is
doable.  But most (not all) transformations can be done simply by
transforming the Bezier control points.  The main exception is offsetting,
where the exact mathematical solution is not tractable, but very good
approximations are available.

All the polygon and geometry operations that we do with line segments are
doable with curves.  Any that cannot be done optimally at a high level can
be approximated by flattening the curve to line segments and unflattening
the results back to Beziers.

Just about every operation that GEOS might need to implement in order to
add curves is well documented and implementations exist, although commonly
in Javascript rather than C or C++ - the packages paper.js and bezierjs are
two very good places to start.
http://paperjs.org/ and http://pomax.github.io/bezierjs/ (or WIP
https://pomax.github.io/BezierInfo-2/ ) I have bookmarks now for a *lot* of
other relevant pages.

The two packages above go hand-in-hand with SVG graphics but are not
synonymous with SVG.  Most (if not all - I haven't found a counterexample
yet) SVG implementations delay many of their operations until they get to
the bitmap rendering stage - a good polygon package ought to be able to do
everything that supports SVG but at the data structure level.

For the moment, for my own benefit, I've added loading and saving of SVG
files to the interface layer that I've built on top of LibGEOS.

What I am currently working on is a hack to add curves to GEOS - I will
flatten any curves from SVG paths on loading, work with the large
straight-line paths using GEOS, but reconstitute and write out Bezier
curves from the results as I save back to SVG files.  (I've got
proof-of-concept code for the re-constitution of Bezier curves from
flattened paths but have not yet built that back into SVG data
structures).  My hope is that if I can get a demonstration working of a
GEOS with curves by using this approximation, it might serve as a starting
point for adding curves (and the corresponding operations) to GEOS properly
within the data structure.

regards,

Graham

As others have said on this thread, adding curve support to GEOS is likely
to be a big effort.

My opinion is that to consider an extension of this magnitude, there needs
to be evidence that this initiative is feasible and sustainable over the
long term (at least 10 years). A good way to demonstrate this is a separate
project that extends GEOS with support for representing curves, and
implementing a *significant* set of *native* operations on curves.  That
project should have at least two developers contributing algorithmic code
to it, to show that there is ability and desire to maintain such complex
code over the long term.

This seems a bit excessive. How much of GEOS has two developers involved in

Over the 20 year lifetime of GEOS there have been at least 6 developers
involved at a deep algorithmic level (fixing bugs and design issues and
contributing new and improved algorithms).  And now that GEOS is so mature
and widely used, I'd say the bar is higher.

Anyway, the key point is: let's see some real code for GEOS curves, and
then the cost/benefit tradeoff will be clearer.

You may find it surprising, but I do appreciate this point of view, and
agree in as much as if I am the only person advocating for it, it's not
going to happen as frankly I'm not "one of us" - I'm not a geographer and
my interest in GEOS is primarily in how far I can stretch it in the
direction of being a generic domain-independent polygon package that could
be used in CAD and other fields. This may not be something you're
interested in and there may not be enough interest in adding curves to the
package from programmers working in the geography field.

And also I agree that a concrete demonstration in terms of a fork or pull
request is a precondition to a more significant effort by the current
maintainers; and I'd be happy to start that myself *if* I were a C++
programmer, but at the age of 65 I honestly do not have the enthusiasm to
learn another language to the depth that I know C, which I think is a
pre-requisite for working on a released codebase in any language.

So I'll continue to potter on working on an interface layered on top of
your package (which is pretty good - the best of all the ones I've looked
at, that support calling from C) and if any of the GEOS developers find
anything I'm working on useful in the future then maybe you'll revisit the
suggestion of adding curves.  I'll drop in infrequently with status updates
- and if they're not welcome or irrelevant, do say so and I'll stop. I'm
pretty thick skinned and won't take offence.

Incidentally I got the code to do the inverse flattening working relatively
well last night.  I thought at first it was producing more Bezier segments
than were needed until I worked out the math that showed that the
elliptical arcs I was reconstituting were literally not possible with a
single Bezier curve. So, progress.

Regards,

Graham

Graham,

 

Please do keep us posted on this with your trials and share your code.

As a fellow member of the ?not one of us? crowd, I am interested in pushing GEOS beyond the very confined geography domain.

 

Thanks,

I commented on the ticket.  It seems fine to preserve the type of the
input.

This might just be an artifact of using OverlayNG under the covers.

In 3.11.2 vs 3.11.1 I find new files installed

ERROR: The following files are in /tmp/work/geography/geos/work/.destdir/usr/pkg but not in the PLIST:
ERROR:         /tmp/work/geography/geos/work/.destdir/usr/pkg/include/geos/algorithm/PolygonNodeTopology.h
ERROR:         /tmp/work/geography/geos/work/.destdir/usr/pkg/include/geos/triangulate/polygon/PolygonNoder.h

and do not immediately see adding new interfaces in NEWS, so I wanted to
check that this is intended/correct before I push the update to pkgsrc.

I? confirm that 3.11.3 build shows two new header files, called 
PolygonNoder.h and PolygonNodeTopology.h

 ? --Brian M Hamlin??? /? MAPLABS? /? OSGeoLive PSC

This is expected, they came along for the backport of 

  - Fix handling of odd cases in PolygonHoleJoiner (JTS-946, Paul Ramsey, Martin Davis)
