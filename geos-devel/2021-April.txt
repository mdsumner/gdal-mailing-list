#1111: BUG: C API: ownership of passed-in geometry not always transferred prior to
exception
--------------------------+--------------------------
 Reporter:  Brendan Ward  |      Owner:  geos-devel@?
     Type:  defect        |     Status:  new
 Priority:  major         |  Milestone:  3.10.0
Component:  Default       |    Version:  3.9.0
 Severity:  Unassigned    |   Keywords:
--------------------------+--------------------------
 In general, the create* functions that take other geometries as inputs
 (e.g., GEOSGeom_createPolygon_r) and take ownership of the passed-in
 geometries on success are supposed to clean them up on failure.

 However, in exception cases (which return NULL for the geometry to be
 created), this isn't handled consistently, which can lead to memory leaks
 because the caller assumes that those geometries are automatically cleaned
 up on failure.  For the cases where the ownership is transferred
 immediately, the caller will segfault if it tries to clean them up.

 If the geometry inputs need to be validated before ultimately using them
 to construct the returned geometry, those should be destroyed before
 returning NULL.

 I haven't done a full review of these create* functions, but
 GEOSGeom_createPolygon_r looks problematic.

 It looks like ownership is transferred early for
 GEOSGeom_createLinearRing_r and GEOSGeom_createLineString_r, so those are
 probably OK.

 (this was discussed a bit on IRC)

I'd like to do a release of 3.8.2, there is a shockingly large backlog and

Subject: [geos-devel] PR for new GeometryFixer API
Message-ID: <CAK2ens1JgPNRG69VSsPbDzhyvNBng4ZzhE0iZt_ajRSqVvrTQA@mail.gmail.com>

JTS recently had a class called GeometryFixer added.  The class provides
functionality to accept any invalid geometry and convert it to a valid
one.  This plugs a noticeable gap in the JTS API!

Paul R has ported this to GEOS:  https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/433

It performs a similar function to the existing GEOS MakeValid (which was a
port of the PostGIS ST_MakeValid).  But it has some differences in
semantics which are simpler and (hopefully) a useful alternative.

See the PR for links to documentation of the functionality of GeometryFixer
(and there will be more docs and images coming soon).

Feedback is welcome, as always.

Important question for downstream maintainers: how wedded are you to
current 'makevalid' output? If you have tests of 'makevalid' right now, and
we replaced the default behaviour with the GeometryFixer, you'd get
different looking (valid) results.

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/433#issuecomment-821597724

However different looking, they are in many cases "more right" looking (in
some cases there's no obviously "right" answer, but in many there are ones
with more rightnesss). In general the processing in geometryfixer should be
faster too (fewer big overlay ops in total).

But still: different. All those unit tests.

What's your tradeoff?

Hi Paul,

no impact for GDAL test suite. It tests MakeValid() in a very light way 
(using mostly the "hourglass" looking invalid polygon)

I've changed the CAPI, this kind of follows Dan's suggestion for an optional signature that can encompass all the behaviours, while leaving the no-parameters default in place. 

https://github.com/libgeos/geos/pull/433/files#diff-cbedc388a4d6d798494e26f51269040e8131b7c3e610b4fb4a792aee4b27e83eR1247-R1289

I still think the default should probably be changed to the new algorithm, but by merging this and then exposing similar switches in PostGIS we can easily try out both and people can see the benefits / drawbacks of the new approach. Since we're still developing, we can also take in feedback ot make the new approach even better.
