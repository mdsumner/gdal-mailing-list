	LinearLocation.java]
Message-ID: <4756995F.5070809@loskot.net>

Folks,

Perhaps some of us have been wondering if this bug applies to GEOS too.
I can confirm it does not. The linearref subpackage of JTS has not been
ported to GEOS yet.

Cheers
Mateusz

Subject: [jts-devel] Strange comparison in LinearLocation.java

Hi,

I've come across a comparison I'm having trouble understanding, and
hope someone can look at it with me.

In src/com/vividsolutions/jts/linearref/LinearLocation.java, on lines
267 and 269, the field 'segmentIndex' is compared to a LineString
instance's getNumGeometries() result. As far as I can tell,
'segmentIndex' represents the vertex in the LineString which starts
the segment which the LinearLocation is bound to, and so this should
be getCoordinateN() instead of getNumGeometries().

Am I missing something?

thanks,
codekaizen

Subject: [geos-devel] Geometry.isRectangle access difference with JTS
Message-ID: <475874F2.8080505@refractions.net>

Fellow GEOSites:
In my pursuit of porting the lastest and greatest changes from JTS 1.9, 
I've run into a minor issue that I'd like to get some opinions on from 
the earlier porters.

In geom::Geometry, isRectangle() is protected. 
In JTS (at least for the past few versions) this function is public. 

Is there any special reason why the GEOS version is protected?

Ben,

I don't know exact rationale but my understanding is that
isRectangle *was* specific to interface of Polygon class only.
However, existence of default implementation (return false) suggests
that the function is supposed to be available for all geometry types.
>From this point, Geometry::isRectangle as protected is just a design bug.

Hi,

I was hoping to get the current version of your code but I am 
experiencing a small problem. The configure script does not appear to be 
being checked out when I try to get your code.

I believe am using the command as stated on your website.  I have 
attached a file which shows the command and the results.

I would appreciate any suggestions as to what I can do differently.

Thanks,

Hugh

Hugh,

I believe you are expected to run the autogen.sh script in the geos
directory to generate configure and related derived files.

You may need reasonably modern versions of autoconf and automake installed
on your system for this to work.

Hugh,

I'm not sure why you mention this.  But if you aren't a programmer you might
consider working from a "packaged source tarball" instead of subversion which
is mostly for developers.  Unless of course you desperately need a particular
recent fix, or wish to contribute to documentation or other aspects.

Best regards,

Then it's a good idea to download and use GEOS packages from the website
instead of use SVN version.

Message-ID: <ae9185aa0712120554q45f26fd9i6845aae736d557ea@mail.gmail.com>

I am trying to build Geos 3.0.0 RC 4 on OS X 10.5.  HCoordinate.cpp
fails because finite() is not defined. Changing it to the FINITE()
macro fixes the problem. I notice that Revision 1.19 switched it from
the macro to the function.

I tried to post a bug report in Trac, but my OSGeo account seems to be
completely foobar.

Hmm, now the build is failing on:

XMLTester.cpp: In function 'void tolower(std::string&)':
XMLTester.cpp:75: error: 'std::tolower' is not a valid template
argument for type 'int ()(int)' because function 'int tolower(int)'

I ran into this problem a couple months ago, and so did mateusz who  
filed a bug and fixed it in SVN.

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/162

You can either grab SVN source, or apply the fix, as I did.

As always, thanks! I'll grab SVN and see if that happens to resolve my
XMLTester.cpp also.

Sorry, missed the part that it's failing on a different problem.  I  
didn't have any problems in XMLTester.cpp.

Did you download and try to compile the whole SVN source, or just  
patch the finite() bug?  Maybe there's a new bug in SVN.

Richard,

This issue has been reported to the Trac and already fixed:

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/162

If you have troubles with your OSGeo account, please follow the section
about updating, perhaps it will help:

Please, try to apply the fix I explained here:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/geos-devel/2007-November/003125.html

It's been also reported as ticket, but I've not applied this fix to the
SVN yet:

Since there's been a lot of people hitting a bug fixed since rc4, I  
tossed out an rc5 based on trunk.

Which brings up again the question "what to do before final 3.0.0?"
There are some outstanding tickets...

http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/report/1

And I don't know that this problem was ever tracked down:

Also useful information regarding 3.0.0 is that Ben@Refractions has  
been working through getting GEOS synched with JTS again, so there is  
a major update waiting in the wings. It might be wise to get 3.0.0  
branched before dropping that into trunk.

I am wondering why you did not have a problem with XMLTester.cpp and I
did. This is very much a long shot, but I am using the "Unix"

I'm not sure what you mean by unix vs developer environments, unless  
you mean configure-make-install in a Terminal and Xcode.app?  (They're  
both technically "developer" and use the same GCC tools.)

I created an Xcode project to build my framework version of GEOS, and  
I forgot that I skip the XMLTester tool (since it's in the tests  
subdir), so I don't have that particular problem.

When you install the xcode  tools from the DVD, custom install, there
are options "Developer Tools Essentials"  which are installed under
/Developer and another option "Unix Development Support" which
<quote>Installs a duplicate of the GCC compiler and command line tools
included with the core Xcode developer tools package into the boot
volume.</quote> I am using only the latter. But it sounds like you
have the real answer below.

Is it possible the fixes are in your sandbox, Mat and not committed?  
I snapped that release off of trunk.

Hello GEOSers,

I'm quite encouraged to see that the latest JTS stuff is headed towards GEOS land, that is very good news.

In terms of GEOS 3, I believe that at Safe we have received and verified some reports of buffering problems that work in JTS but not in GEOS.  I didn't see anything like this mentioned on the bug list that Paul pointed to, so I will try to get someone here to retest and if these are problems we'll look into them further and if needed submit them (or ideally just provide a fix, but I can't promise).

Anyone else out there know of buffering failures in GEOS, and have nice duplicable cases?

Dale

Dale,

Once they are confirmed as issues still, please do submit them, so we  
have a record of them in trac no matter what happens.  If you fix  
them, we can simply close out the issues.

Thanks,

Paul

Yes, but my super-duper application deployment script points at the

Shame on me. I fixed these issues in tickets only.
I patched GEOS in SVN today, so now these two problems should be gone:

Paul,

Great news!

Is Ben going to cover new features with unit tests (geos\tests\unit) ?
It would help a lot, as we've not collected good tests coverage still.

Paul, could you put the snapshot in a directory that we could browse
into? That way we could check the timestamp to be sure things are working.

The timestamp was correct, it was generated last night, it just  
didn't have the right content...

It may seem precipitate to talk about 3.1 when we've spend over a  
year in 3.0.0rcX, but Ben's work on the JTS upgrade and  
PreparedGeometry are ready to see the light of day, and it makes

a branch. And probably be released "officially". Discussion?

Paul,

I concur.  I'm +1 on making current trunk a 3.0 final release (or even
promoting 3.0.0rc5 to be 3.0).

I presume trunk will be copied to /branches/3.0?

How much time will it take to merge Ben's work?  How significant are the 
changes?  How much time until they are "production" ready?

Depending on those answers, I could be fine with just merging Ben's 
changes in, stabilizing trunk, and then calling it 3.0.

Obviously in the general case branching off 3.0 would make sense.  But 
in this case, will anyone actually use that branch?  Will anyone 
maintain it (seems unlikely since there hasn't been resources to wrap it 
up an release it).  So maybe its not worth the bother.

Charlie

+1.  Let's go final with what's in trunk (RC5 + a few small OSX  
Leopard tweaks).

Ben's done all his work on VC++ (imagine!) so when he merges in,  
trunk will be broken until we clean it up a bit. I think that's a  
good enough reason to branch 3.0.  I concur with your concerns about  
maintenance, but I don't know how much appetite there is for a  
maintained, but semi-stable version versus a relatively static but  
stable version. People used 2.2.x for a very long time, just because  
it was a known-stable, even though most all the development time was  
going into 3.0 at that point.

+1 for releasing 3.0.0rc5 as 3.0.0 and copying to branches/3.0.0

Are we going to keep fixing bugs in branches/3.0.0, following similar
procedure as GDAL does?

Mateusz,

Charlie seems to doubt the need for this, but I think it is good for us to
treat 3.0 as a stable branch so we can put out a 3.0.1 if we fine some
significant errors in the next few months before Ben's (3.1) work is complete.

GEOS is a bedrock component for a lot of packages so I think at least some
degree of maintenance of a stable branch is called for.

IMHO.

Its not that I doubt its a good idea.  Its that I doubt there are the 
people to actually maintain the branch.  If there are, then by all means 
  there should be a branch.

Charlie,

I guess I'm optimistic that the osgeo transition will also correspond with
a broader and more "enabled" developer community.  But honestly, it does not
seem likely there will be a lot of activity in the stable branch.

For what is worth, +1 for 3.0.0 stable and branch.

I second Frank's opinion. After a few months of branch-based GDAL
maintenance, I can say it's not a hassle at all to submit fixes to trunk
and to stable branch, if a fix is dedicated to stable branch.

The only thing that needs to be kept in mind is to remember to review
ticket and set milestone properly in Trac, to avoid ambiguities.

Short example of the process:

- a bug has been reported for 3.0.0
- review if fix is safe for stable branch to target 3.0.1
-- then set mileston to 3.0.1 (stable branch) or to new release
   (3.1.0 or may be 4.0.0, depending on versioning scheme)
- if it is safe:
-- commit to both trunk and branches/3.0.0
- if not safe (ie. because changeset is too huge, etc.)
-- commit to trunk only and set


$ cd trunk
$ svn ci -m "Fix for #"
Revision 12
$ cd ../branches/3.0.0
$ svn merge -r 11:12 http://svn.osgeo.org/geos/trunk/
$ svn ci -m "Ported fix for # to stable branch"
Revision 13

Sounds good to me. Given that it's been nearly a year since RC4 and RC5,
and the fact that a RC should be pretty much the final product, I'd say
go for a branch and release. At this stage in the game, I don't think
it's fair to all those people who have tested/built against RCs to turn
around and say "sorry folks, even though we got to RC we're not going to
release, and by the way we're going to make the tree unstable again for
several weeks while we merge in new features and change the API
again...".

I would say though that it's worth spending a day going through the
bugtracker and fixing any low-hanging fruit, with a particular emphasis
on build fixes so we can be reasonably sure that trunk builds on
everything *before* branching and merging in the changes (esp. since if
Ben has been working with VC++, there are likely to be things in the
merge that will break other compilers such as gcc).


ATB,

Mark.

Mark,

After Ben commits his work, we can observe how it builds on GCC in
buildbot: http://buildbot.osgeo.org:8506/
I build GEOS every day using Visual C++ and GCC, so I assume we will
clean gcc/vc++ issues pretty fast.

The changes I've made are minimal to the existing codebase. I added a 
couple of functions, changed one or two to virtual, and modified the 
namespace of one class.  Otherwise, pretty much everything I did is new 
code. 

Right now the code builds just fine (in VC++), passes all the tests I've 
put to it, and leaks a bit of memory.

I've also modified the XMLTester. to allow it to test only predicates, 
and use that to check that the prepared geometry predicates give the 
same answer as the normal versions.

I'm encountering a problem with the 3.0 release candidate that blocks a

I don't understand why the install-pkgpythonPYTHON target is attempted

Hmm, its been a while since strk and I went through all the autoconf 
settings.  I remember it like you do - you have to ask for the swig 
bindings to be built - but maybe that isn't the case.

You can probably just disable them though by --disable-python --disable-ruby

Thinking about this more, I think the way this was setup is to run SWIG 
if the bindings file (*.cxx) is older than any changes to the SWIG 
interface files (*.i).

That should not be the case unless you've modified the interface files, 
or they've somehow been modified in SVN since the generation of the 
*.cxx files.

I wonder then if I'm experiencing an unintended side effect. I've not
enabled swig python or ruby and swig is not run to produce wrappers
(good), but the machine still steps into swig/python/Makefile and
executes targets therein, even attempting to byte compile nonexistant
modules.

IMO, unless swig/python is explicitly enabled, make should skip that
branch of the tree. Or am I overlooking something?

Same here.

The mkinstalldirs script appears to be buggy on this particular
platform. One shift too many. Strangely, the 3.0rc builds fine on
another Ubuntu 6.10 i686 of mine. Same bash version even.

I suppose I could try to fix mkinstalldirs, but it seems like it should
be simpler and more foolproof for the build to ignore swig/python
alltogether unless it is explicitly enabled.

The release version 
(http://geos.refractions.net/downloads/geos-3.0.0.tar.bz2) seems to work 
OK for me w/o the python SWIG bindings.  My system is 64bit RHEL 5.

By the way what is the status of the python bindings at 3.0?  I couldn't 
get them to compile and recall that they were not actively maintained. 
Can someone confirm?

Thanks!

It was released? Did I miss something?

Well - the Ruby and Python bindings share about 90% of the same SWIG 
interface files.  So in theory they should work.  And last time I 
checked they did.  But since they are not actively used as far as I can 
tell, some issues could have slipped through.

What specifically isn't working?

It would be good to know what is going wrong.  Strk and I did (and Mark 
a bit) did spend some time trying to make sure this works, and it seems 
like you've found some bug in the code or our logic.

I'd like to implement the solution at

http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Conditional-Subdirectories.html

It appears trivial. Was there really a 3.0 final made on the 21st as
appears in the downloads directory? If not, I'd really like to make this
fix ASAP.

Hi Sean,

Having looked at Makefile.am in the SWIG directory, the mkinstalldir
target appears to be generated automatically by autotools. So while I
don't object to applying a conditional subdirectory fix, the fact that
it works on another box of yours with the same configuration means that
there is something else somewhere on your box which is causing the build
to fail. In other words, applying a patch for this is just masquerading
another problem on the box in question.

(FWIW it builds fine here on 32-bit Ubuntu 6.06)


Kind regards,

Mark.

Maybe it does in this case, but making the builds conditional also heads
off any number of future problems of this sort. If you look in
swig/python/Makefile.am, you'll see that conditional building has
already been implemented, but in a less robust fashion.

It was trivial. See the patch on http://trac.osgeo.org/geos/ticket/168.

Can you also spend a bit of time and track down the underlying issue? 
Would be good to now what is broken and why.

+1. Since myself & Charlie re-wrote a lot of the autoconf logic, it
wouldn't surprise me if something had managed to slip through. A good
place to start might be to look at which packages are installed, whether
they are hand-compiled or installed using a package manager, and also
the output at the end of configure.


Kind regards,

Mark.
