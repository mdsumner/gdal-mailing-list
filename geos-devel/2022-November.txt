Hi,

Not for the first time, I've been testing some code changes that work in
all of our CI environments except for Visual Studio 2015. We recently
removed support for gcc 4.8 and I'm wondering if we should consider
removing support for MSVC 2015 in the same release. Like gcc 4.8, MSVC 2015
lacks 100% C++11 support. It also requires us to maintain an AppVeyor CI
setup solely for this compiler. Is there any particular interest in this
compiler, or can we remove it and save some effort implementing workarounds?

I vote for drop for GEOS 3.12+

I guess technically we can?t drop for 3.11 and below since those would be considered breaking changes.

 

I personally don?t have an interest in MSVC in general and I only have MSVC 2019 installed if I cared to use MSVC for anything.  So dropping MSVC2015 is fine with me.

 

FWIW MS changed their policy of visual studio redistributable, so the latest redistributable covers 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022

 

https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170

 

So dropping the MSVC2015 I see only as an inconvenience to developers who for whatever reason choose to stick with 2015, of those they probably don?t need to run newer GEOS either.  MSVC2015 main support ended 2 years ago and is now on extended life support. https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2015

 

Thanks,

Regina

I have no skin in the game, so I'm OK for dropping MSVC 2015 going forward... for what that's worth (nothing).

for what it's worth, neither GDAL nor PROJ have VS2015 testing any 
longer, partly because maintaining a specific AppVeyor setup for that 
was too painful.

Hi Dan, ok to remove MSVC 2015 (likely the minimum should be MSVC 2019 
today).

thanks,
