 We've been trying to get GEOS 3.3.0 to compile udner my mingw-64 on a
 Windows 2008 64-bit box.  I get the same issue using the mingw-64/32 bit
 version and with several different builds as well.

 I have been successful compiling PostgreSQL under mingw-64, but to I know
 Andrew Dunstan went thru a great deal of pain making this possible.  I
 fear the road to glory may be paved with rocks.

 Of course this is all so I can get PostGIS to run under 64-bit PostgreSQL.
 BTW now that geos 3.3.0 is now released, don't  you think you should add
 it to the version list.

 I have attached our build log and configure log.  for reference this is
 the mingw64 build we are using --

Comment(by robe):

 I should add.  I tried CMake, but no success there.  Do I need a 64-bit
 version of Cmake.  All the windows binaries of Cmake I could find are
 32-bit.  It got halted at couldn't find gcc compile CL .  I'll have to
 revisit that.  I treid poitning it at my mingw-64..g++.exe one, but it
 didn't seem to enjoy that too much.

 There is no need for CMake 64-bit to build software using 64-bit
 toolchain.
 CMake is just an executor, it can run nearly any compiler it can find in
 the system.

 unless someone commits to fix this there's no point in targetting a real

I took a look at the JTS code, and it's certainly possible to add a
short-circuit to the Validation code for detecting self-intersections.
?That would avoid memory explosion in cases like this, so it would be
nice to do. ?However, it involves some fairly delicate refactoring, so
it's not a half-hour fix.
It might be worth filing this as a GEOS bug (although for my part the
preferred approach would be to solve this in JTS first, and then port
the changes to GEOS).

Subject: [geos-devel] Building Multipolygons from Rings
Message-ID: <4E0060CF.10907@remote.org>

Hi,

    I have one broad and one specific question regarding the 
construction of polygons from linework. They arise from an algorithm 
that I have written to generate proper multipolygons from OpenStreetMap 
data.

The broad question is:

Suppose you have a number of linestrings which, if all is well, 
constitute the linework for a multipolygon, but there might also be 
errors like a gap in a ring, and you'll frequently have touching inner 
rings. You don't know in advance how many rings there are and which are 
the inner and outer bits. Even if there are geometry errors you want to 
salvage as much as possible because your only other option is to discard 
the whole thing. Does somebody have a relatively robust way to make a 
proper multipolygon from that? I cannot use the standard polygonizer 
because it is not resilient enough; it will often produce invalid 
geometries.

My current algorithm is along the lines of (1) try to assemble linework 
into rings, discard dangling bits; (2) fix trivial self-intersections 
and small gaps in each ring individually; (3) build a "hierarchy" of 
rings by checking which ring contains which other ring; (4) merge 
touching rings; (5) build polygons from outer/inner ring groups; (6) 
build multipolygon.

This works ok even though the auto-fix bits in (2) leave much to be 
desired at the moment (I have not yet found a good way to fix rings with 
more than one self-intersection sensibly).

The specific question is:

My above algorithm needs to create a matrix that determines which ring 
is inside which other ring. I have recently encountered a polygon in 
OpenStreetMap that had a very complex (100,000 node) outer ring and very 
many (about 10,000), relatively simple, inner rings. (A forest area in 
Japan, if you want to know.) My algorithm took several hours to build 
the "what contains what" matrix. The matrix is rather large but the 
small polygons were usually not the problem; the problem were the 
roughly 10,000 "does this 100k node polygon contains this little 
polygon" tests. Even when I reduced this from polygon.contains(polygon) 
to polygon.contains(random single vertex of polygon) it hardly went any 
faster.

Is there a way how I can somehow pre-process my 100k node polygon to 
make the "contains" queries go faster? I have the impression that 
"contains" must do some preprocessing internally, and that maybe the 
same preprocessing is repeated unnecessarily if I do 10,000 "contains" 
checks for the same polygon?

Bye

Take a look at the Prepared geometry interfaces.

Switched to a PreparedPolygon and its "containsProperly" method, and 
processing time for my complex test case is now down from > 2 hours to 
10 seconds. Thanks a lot!

Subject: [geos-devel] compiling 3.3.0 on 64-bit RHEL 6
Message-ID: <4E021609.6030200@noaa.gov>

Hello All,

I'm getting an XMLTester error during "make check" after a successful
compile (see below). Platform is 64-bit RHEL 6.1.  No options provided
to configure.  Any ideas as to the problem?  Does this test failure
suggest a severity that would prevent me from using the library?

Thanks!

Which compiler are you using ?
I have the impression I already read about such an issue.
Did you search on the trac instance ?

Subject: [geos-devel] Diff between "self-intersect" and "ring self-intersect"
Message-ID: <BANLkTimtvcF6BRmWaTsz3qN_pHxRWLp8RQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm using the spatialite to do some spatials elaboration.
Spatialite will use the Geos . try-ing the test of validity on the
geometries I'm having some warning message .

Substantially there are three kind of message but I dont know the real
difference between the two type of message.

the message are:

"GEOS warning: Ring Self-intersection at or near point ..."

the other is :

"GEOS warning: Self-intersection at or near point ..."

and the third is

"GEOS: warning: Hole lies outside shell at or near point ..."

Thx,

Further investigation suggests that a single test is failing on RHEL6:

[jcc@lynx xmltester]$ ./XMLTester -v ./tests/general/TestWithinDistance.xml
lt-XMLTester: GeometryComponentFilter.cpp:35: virtual void
geos::geom::GeometryComponentFilter::filter_ro(const
geos::geom::Geometry*): Assertion `0' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)

Test fails on both 3.2.0 and 3.3.0 under RHEL6; both succeed under RHEL5.

Thanks for any suggestions!

Subject: [geos-devel] ffi-geos for Ruby 0.0.1 release
Message-ID: <BANLkTinO1R1Cy8DWCFrSvQ6R5qXA6cDfKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hey list.

I finally got around to a "stable" release for ffi-geos on Ruby.
Featuring the staggering version number of 0.0.1, this release appears
to be pretty stable and "Good To Go". We've been using the extension
in production for a while now at work and things look pretty good, so
I figured that it was time for an official stable release.

Thanks to Daniel Azuma for the help with all the testing and the JRuby
fixes, and thanks to all you guys for GEOS.

Without further ado, some linkage:

https://rubygems.org/gems/ffi-geos
https://github.com/dark-panda/ffi-geos

Cheers!

 Just compiled trunk and if I'm not mistaken.  Well at least under mingw,
 this is generating a libgeos-3-3-0.dll.  Shouldn't this be
 libgeos-3-3-1.dll.  Is this only happening to me?
