Hi gdal-developers,
can someone help me understand how to modify
and
create images using the gdal and gdalnumeric python modules?

I have no trouble reading the files in, but am a bit confused about how to
save changes and close the image.

For example, under gdalnumeric, you can use:

from Numeric import *
import gdalnumeric

array=gdalnumeric.LoadFile("/some/image.tiff")
array2=array*-1

but now I am unsure how to save array2 to a new tiff, but keep or copy the
projection information from "/some/image.tiff".
If I use SaveArray(array2,'/some/newimage.tiff') it doesn't have the same
projection information as image.tiff, and I am not sure how to copy that
information across.

It would be great if someone could fill the last few lines in for me.

Thanks,
Robert

Robert,

The problem is that the raw arrays in numpy don't have information like
georeferencing or projections associated with them. The following script
demonstrates how to create a GDAL Dataset object associated with an array
and to assign the projection and georeferencing to it, and then write to an
output file. I hope it makes things clearer.

Best regards,
