Hi, 

There is no such thing as ogr_spatialref.cpp. Most of the OGRSpatialReference
implementation is in ogrspatialreference.cpp, but a few methods are in other
files. All the files are in gdal/ogr. 

Are you wanting to separate out the OGRSpatialReference stuff from GDAL to 
use in a project?

Folks, 

I have checked in support for writing Erdas Imagine files. The Erdas
Imagine reader has also been upgraded to support projections and a few other
items too. 

This new feature brought to you by letters P, C and I.

Hi all,

Just downloaded the latest from CVS and compiled, then tried to
test GDAL from Python (I am using 2.0). I got an "undefined symbol"
problem:

Python 2.0 (#1, Oct 19 2000, 00:29:59)
[GCC 2.95.2 19991024 (release)] on linux2
Type "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

import _gdal
ImportError: /usr/local/lib/python2.0/site-packages/_gdalmodule.so:
undefined symbol: OSRSetStatePlane

This symbol is also not in libgdal.1.1.so, and that's the only
GDAL-specific library
_gdalmodule.so depends on.

Am I missing something?

Thanks
Aleksey

Aleksey,

Sorry about that. I neglected to commit gdal/ogr/ogr_fromepsg.cpp changes.
Please do a cvs update and make again. You shouldn't need to do a clean build
or anything like that. 

Note that I have never tried the GDAL python bindings with Python 2.0. I 
would appreciate hearing if it works or not.

Hi,
I am interested in using the gdal library, and thought I would get
started by having a look at some examples, like gdal_translate. I can
only seem to get this to work for GTiff formats, though I know you
have done lots of work on other formats. Ideally I would like to be
able to translate from img to say AIGrid and the reverse. But when I
try anything other than the default, I get 

0.ERROR 6: GDALDriver::Create() ... no create method implemented for
this format.


I called it like this:
gdal_translate -of HFA -b 1 irvine2.img irvine3.img

Perhaps someone could explain my problem?

Regards,
Robert Denham

Robert, 

Only some of the formats support creation of output files. The high level
formats list, and the individual format descriptions should (in theory) address
what is possible. 

http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/formats_list.html

What version of GDAL are you using? The last source release predates the
addition of Erdas Imagine write support, even though the online documentation
(and code in CVS) supports this. 

You should be able to translate to formats such as JPEG, MFF, PCI .aux, and
PNG (with various limitations) using the release version of GDAL. If you
are intersted in Erdas Imagine .img support, I would suggest building GDAL
from CVS.

Yes, I think it is a version problem. I am using gdal-1.1.1, and I see
that the img writing stuff is very recent. Unfortunately I am having
trouble using cvs through our network system. I tried browsing the cvs
from the web page and grabbing what I needed, but this didn't work. I
think I will have to wait until an new version is zipped up. 


Thanks,

Robert,

I have prepared a semi-official 1.1.2 release. You can get it from:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal-1.1.2.tar.gz

I would appreciate any feedback on the Imagine read or write support.

I went through functions/methods in gdal.py, they work just fine,
with only 2 exceptions (and they don't look 2.0 specific):

1.
class Band:
def GetRasterColorTable(self):
_ct = _gdal.GDALGetRasterColorTable( self._o )
if _ct is None:
return None
else:
return gdal.GDALColorTable( _ct )
Should be: return _gdal.GDALColorTable( _ct )

2. Band.GetNoDataValue:
>>> aBand.GetNoDataValue()
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in ?
File "/usr/local/lib/python2.0/site-packages/gdal.py", line 323, in
GetNoDataValue
return _gdal.GDALGetRasterNoDataValue(self._o)
AttributeError: GDALGetRasterNoDataValue


Still have to check osr.py...

Best regards,
Aleksey

Message-ID: <39FD2C7E.D01201F8@a...>

Hi all,

I am having a hard time trying to read a '.bil' file. The file came with a
corresponding
'.hdr' file, so I assume that it's an ESRI .hdr Labelled file (EHdr driver).

Here's the content of the .hdr file:
byteorder M
layout bil
nbands 1
nbits 32
ncols 304
nrows 364
ulxmap -115.717083
ulymap 43.449583
xdim 0.033333
ydim 0.033333

I tried to read it with a simple C++ code borrowed from API tutorial (the exect
code
used is included below). Here's the output I get upon running:

Driver: EHdr/ESRI .hdr Labelled
Block=304x1 Type=UInt32, ColorInterp=Undefined
Min=0.000000, Max=4294967295.000000
Computing min/max...
Min=0.000000, Max=0.000000

Here the last line is supposed to show the actual values, since I force
GDALComputeRasterMinMax() to recompute and take all numbers into account.

I can't understand why I get all zeroes (I get the same in OpenEv - obviously,
it's based on GDAL)! I used Python to read the .bil file pixel by pixel and I know

that there are real numbers there...

I then thought that it't the byte order that's screwing things up (indeed, the
numbers as read in Python were unrealistically huge). So I converted
the original 'cbw00003.bil' to another one, reversing the bytes with
pack() and unpack() from the struct module. Now the numbers are
within the range 0 - 3611 (and 2147483648, must indicate no data or
something...).

So I have this new '.bil' file and the corresponding '.hdr' file (I tried it both
with "byteorder M" line and without it) and I still get only zeroes!

What am I doing wrong? Any clue would be appreciated...

Thanks
Aleksey

P.S. I use the latest GDAL from CVS (as of 2-3 days ago...)

Aleksey,

I am not quite sure why this isn't working. The gdal/frmts/raw/ehdrdatsaet.cpp
code does include code to look at the byteorder flag, and swap data if 
required. Could you send me your dataset? What platform are you working on?
Could you send you gdal/port/cpl_config.h file?

Fixed.

You are right, these were not 2.0 specific issues.

Alexsey,

I have determined that the problem is your selecting the header file to
open instead of the data file. I know this, because I made the same 
mistake. :-)

I have fixed the EHdr user documentation in frmt_various.html, and will
modify the driver to emit a reasonable error if the user does this. 

Best regards,

Thanks, Frank! It works now... very stupid of me :-)

I have another question - about WKT, well known text format
for geometry. OGR has methods to deal with WKT in several classes,
like OGRPolygon::importFromWkt(). I can see what they do, but is
there a formal description of the WKT format somewhere? I am looking
in the current "OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for OLE/COM"
document, but see no description of WKT, only WKB. Where should
I look?

BTW, what does OGR stand for (Open GIS ?...)? It's easier to
remember this way... :-)

Thanks
Aleksey

Aleksey, 

Questions about OGR are better sent on the sfcom-dev@egroups.com list, though
the line between OGR and GDAL is a bit blurry.

There are a two well known text formats. One for coordinate systems (used
through GDAL to represent projections), and one for vector geometry (used
only with the OGRGeometry derived classes). 

As far as I know the well known text for geometry is defined only within the
OGC Simple Features for SQL standard. 

When I started OGR presumptuously stood for "Open GIS Reference" as I hoped
it might become a reference implementation of the some of the simple features
specifications. Now it just stands for OGR, and the full name for the OGR
portion of GDAL is the "OGR Simple Features Library". 

Best regards,

Thank you for clarifying this for me, Frank. I'll send further questions to
sfcom-devel...
