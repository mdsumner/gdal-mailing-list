April,

I have incorporated your change, though taken the liberty of just calling
the method GetBand(). I haven't documented it as I am not convinced I want
to popularize it.

PS. Would you like CVS access to the GDAL tree?

PPS. Will the LAS driver be committed to CVS soon?

Subject: djvu: interesting?
Message-ID: <a5pv1k+po01@eGroups.com>

DjVuLibre (http://djvu.sourceforge.net/) is a GPL'd document
compression system. It includes: 
c44: a wavelet-based continuous-tone image encoder (a la JPEG-2000)
which is built around the library included in the package (as is
djview, the sample viewer).

I did some testing with USGS TIFF-format DOQs (I used the images
available from PASDA http://www.pasda.psu.edu).

I tried several of these images and found no degradation.
Representative compression was:
33130126 braddock_pa_sw.tif (ZIP-compressed GeoTIFF)
45946667 braddock_pa_sw.tif (uncompressed GeoTIFF)
5552480 braddock_pa_sw.djv (DjVu IW44 compressed, default options)

Is this interesting at all?

Derrick,

The fact that this includes continous tone image support does make it fairly
interesting for inclusion in GDAL. The fact that well integrated web plugins
are available for browsers might make it very interesting for UMN MapServer.

I have been planning to incorporate the JasPer JPEG2000
compressor/decompressor in GDAL. DjVu might be nice too.

Best regards,

Also, the use of the GPL and not LGPL makes it not suitable for commercial
applications
where GDAL is likely to find room.

Subject: Error when opening an SDTS Vector Dataset -- patch attached
Message-ID: <1015312386.9429.60.camel@sarvis>


Frank W.:

Forgive the cross-posting... it wasn't clear which list this was most
appropriate to.

I ran into a problem with GDAL when using OpenEV's reference application
(openev.py). I was attempting to load an SDTS Vector dataset without
success, with the application (actually gdal) complaining (more or less)
that yes, it can see that this is an SDTS dataset, but that the dataset
has no cell layers. So I went poking around in the code a bit and found
that the problem is with the GDAL SDTS driver treating this as an
"error" condition, and so the application looks no further and never
loops into the OGR SDTS driver.

Applying the patch (basically a one-liner) attached to this e-mail
solves the problem.

I don't think I would quite call this a "bug", when considered strictly
in a GDAL context. However, in a combined GDAL/OGR scenario, the
handling of this exception is somewhat problematic. It's not clear what
side effects this patch might have on other applications, but I thought
I'd give you a heads up that you might be getting other similar reports
due to the problem. I leave you with determining the real fix.

Best regards.


(By the way, your code is a delight to work with. Thanks for your many
contributions to the open source community.)

Hi-

I'm just starting to poke around with the GDAL toolkit, and I am
getting a warning on every OGRFeature(Area) when running s57dump on some ENC
data from NOAA. The message is:

Warning 1: Polygon assembly has failed for feature FIDN=136123493,FIDS=1224.
Geometry may be missing or incomplete.

I looked at one of the polygons, and it, although large and convoluted,
was a complete, enclosed polygon. I'm a real newbie to ENC, GIS, and this
toolkit - is there something fundamental I'm missing here? 

Thanks,

Eric,

First please verify that you have Revision 1.4 of
gdal/ogr/ograssemblepolygon.cpp if you have been working from CVS. There was
a problem in CVS briefly due to quirks in my new "tolerance" support in the
polygon assembly code.

If that is OK, then perhaps you could forward me a dataset so I could check
out why assembly is failing.

Note that my code for assembling S-57 polygons ignores the built-in information
about arc direction and connectivity, and just tries to assemble the arcs
by connecting end points. While I haven't noticed any problems with well
behaved geometry before, it is possible this fails in some sort of weird
case of self intersecting rings.

Best regards,

Thanks, that was it. I had the 1.1.1.1 revision of ograssemblepolygon. :)



On another note, the viewer fails to build due to an unsupported function call:
GDALCreateProjDef. I found this:

void *GDALCreateProjDef( const char * pszDef )
{
CPLDebug( "GDAL", "GDALCreateProjDef no longer supported." );
return NULL;
}

and assume there is replacement code somewhere and a viewer rewrite is in the
works. Is this a correct assumption? Is there anything I can do to assist in
getting the viewer to build?

Thanks,
-Eric.

Eric,

The viewer is a defunct effort. I now use OpenEV (openev.sf.net) as my
viewer for most purposes. It includes support for reading using GDAL/OGR.

Well, there's a problem with zlib:

http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2002-026.html

and the zlib source is included in the GDAL tree. I have grabbed the patch
from the RedHat SRPM, and attached it here for simplicity. Just save the
attached file and do a 'patch .../gdal/frmts/zlib/infblock.c infblock.patch'
and rebuild.

I was curious to find this though. Why is zlib source included in this tree,
instead of required and dynamically linked?

Happy patching!
-Eric.

Eric,

I have applied the patch.

GDAL includes the zlib source because I prefer to have as much of the code
required for GDAL as possible within the source tree. Previously attempting
to build against installed zlibs resulted in lots of version issues.
However, it is still possible to configure GDAL to use the system zlib -
in fact, I think that is what configure does by default.

Subject: Analyzing data using GDAL
Message-ID: <OF17D3EE6B.9AF923CD-ON88256B8A.00053BC6@LocalDomain>

Howdy,
I wrote an old program that recursively looks through folders on a given
drive, searching for various types of data. I would like to this using
GDAL and OGR instead (because I know ANYTHING has to be faster than ArcInfo
AML which I used!). Initially I've been trying to use Perl, but I find I
resort to system() calls which I bet is very efficient. I basically take
every folder or file and want to find out whether or not it matchs GDAL/OGR
supported data types. To date I just used gdalinfo/ogrinfo to see if the
output gives me an error or not - I know this is probably very lame. Do I
have to jump into Python to do more, or can I get at stuff via Perl or
simple bash? I see all the docs point to python or c++ right? I'm not
confident at either so I'm looking for something easy to use :)
Any suggestions?
I should say that my application basically makes inserts into a database
that catalogues of all the spatial data on a given drive. I'm using
GDAL/OGR in order to make it portable and open source, but need some help
getting going.

Tyler

Subject: CVS, Cygwin and TIFF error
Message-ID: <OF33D156A5.296773C6-ON88256B8A.005EE941@LocalDomain>

Can anyone help me work around this notice I get whenever I run "gdalinfo"?
The message box appears with the title: "gdalinfo.exe -Entry Point Not
Found"
The message is:
"The procedure entry point TIFFComputeStrip could not be located in the
dynamic link library cygtiff3.dll"
I compiled it with internal tiff, so I'm a little confused. I also have
the source, though, for libtiff on my system. I had similar errors pop up
before I turned off png support.
Any comments?
