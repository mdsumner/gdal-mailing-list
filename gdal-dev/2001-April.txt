Tyler, 

I too am interested in supporting ECW support. The licensing terms on 
the ecw library seem reasonable, albiet not free software in the source
available sense. For the time being it appears it would only be supported
by GDAL on Windows.

Folks, 

I have made a prelinary attempt to add ECW support to GDAL with some success.
The implementation is in gdal/frmts/ecw, and to build it in you need to 
uncomment the ECW definitions, and correct the ECWDIR definition.

Of course, you also need to download and install the ECW SDK from Ermapper
(www.ermapper.com). 

Issues:
o The ECW SDK seems to have some sorts of threading issues. I am not to
Windows savvy, but I think I am currently building with default C libraries
on Windows, when I should be using multithreaded libraries. 

o It seems that exit() isn't working properly for applications using GDAL
if the ECW driver gets called. In particular exit() hangs on WinNT, and
you need to terminate the task with the Task Manager. I imagine this 
relates to the above multi-threading problems. 

o Overall performance is disappointing in OpenEV. I am not sure why, but
the "set view" call in the ECW SDK seems pretty expensive, and I am making
one for every tile request. 

o Performance is terribly bad for stuff like gdal_translate because a set
view is done for each scanline. I can, and will likely improve on this
in the future by keeping "view state" across multiple RasterIO calls. 

o On the up side, GDAL is taking advantage of the ECW SDK support for 
extracting overviews efficiently, and the GDAL ECW driver reports support
for "arbitrary overviews" to the application. A GDAL RasterIO method is
implemented for ECW allowing maximum efficiency extracting tiles and
different resolutions. Note, I believe this results in skipping the
GDAL tile cache entirely which may be good or bad depending on your 
view point, and circumstances. 

o The ECW file open function (NCScbmOpenFileView()) is crashing for me 
sometimes when called with non-ECW files. For the time being I only
try to open files if they have the ecw extention, meaning that support
for the ecw-over-the-net urls doesn't work now. This could be changed
in the future. 

If there is sufficient interest I could try and prepare a current OpenEV
build with ECW support, though I don't have the where-with-all to build 
the fancy installer, so it would just be a zip file of the install tree.

Hi Frank,
I am very interested in a windows build on openev with this functionality.
Particularly interested in using it for some 3d viewing if possible.
Currenltly I am uncompressing/converting to JPEG.
Now ECW is pretty neat because it only display what you can see at a
particular scale - how do you account for this in gdal and/or openev. As
you zoom in you should see more detail right?

Tyler, 

Right. 

OpenEV has a concept of asking files (via GDAL) for reduced resolution
overviews when displaying at overview levels, and then if the user zooms
in, each of the tiles is updated with full resolution imagery as time
permits. 

In most file formats extracting overviews is only efficient if extra overview
levels have been built. In the case of ECW the overviews can (apparently)
be extracted especially efficiently because of the nature of wavelets. 

I will try to prepare a new OpenEV distribution sometime this week. Bug
me Friday if you haven't heard anything more.

Okay, that makes sense.
I am really interested in open source GIS, can you recommend any
established or up and coming projects that will help me do analysis? I
think I heard your name on the Fmaps list once, right? I'll definitely
harass you on Friday ;) I'm just starting to get into Linux development on
a PC at home, but on windows I'm pretty daft in compiling anything. Are
you using GCC on windows to build?
Are you in Toronto? Working independently? I'm in central interior of
B.C. at a sawmill. We've got lots of data to play with.

Message-ID: <OF5E98CF2A.94643DF5-ON88256A24.0055729B@l...>

I noticed in a technical document about OPENev that it utilizes the GIMP
tool kit.
Does this mean that it could be easily integrated with GIMP through a
plug-in as well?
GIMP already has so many tools, I wonder if a set of plug-ins could be
developed to allow image classification, and maybe even vector area totals,
overlays and unions, etc.
Has there been any discussion around this already?

Most curiously yours,

Tyler, 

This question really belongs on openev-discuss. 

The GIMP Tool Kit is "GTK+", the GUI library used for GIMP and OpenEV. 
As such it doesn't really do much to make it easy to integrate components
of OpenEV within GIMP.

Message-ID: <Pine.OSF.4.20.0104100754270.7560-100000@e...>

I am keen to experiment with the python bindings linking gdal with
Numeric, and have a question about creating new images. 

If I use:

from Numeric import *
import gdalnumeric

array = gdalnumeric.LoadFile( "/some/image/test.tif")
array2 = some manipulation of (array)

I am unsure about how to save array2 to a new image. I tried using
SaveArray, which works, but I am not
sure how to have the same projection and geotransform as the original
image. Do I have to reopen the original and the new image, and copy the
projection and geotransform information across?

It would be great if you could give a quick example showing how to save
array2 as a new image with the same projection and geotransform
information as "/some/image/test.tif".

Thanks

Folks, 

I have implemented ECW write support, and it seems to be working well, 
at least for my one test image :-), with the caveat from before that for
some reason any application that uses the ECW SDK hangs on exit.

Subject: Stuck trying to translate ArcGrid Binary Data
Message-ID: <9cdl17+4e2q@eGroups.com>

Hello,
I am looking to translate some binary ArcGrid data to a form such as 
Ascii ArcGrid or tiff to use in a tool such as Teragen or GenesisII.

When I run gdalinfo on the data i get the following:

C:\Downloads\gdal-114-ntbin\gdal114\bin>gdalinfo gx25dem
Driver: AIG/Arc/Info Binary Grid
Size is 928, 918
Coordinate System is `'
Origin = (2722695.925926,6228446.759259)
Pixel Size = (25.000000,-25.000000)
Corner Coordinates:
Upper Left ( 2722695.926, 6228446.759)
Lower Left ( 2722695.926, 6205496.759)
Upper Right ( 2745895.926, 6228446.759)
Lower Right ( 2745895.926, 6205496.759)
Center ( 2734295.926, 6216971.759)
Band 1 Block=256x4 Type=Int32, ColorInterp=Undefined
Min=700.000/1, Max=2797.000/1

Now I want to convert this into something else like a jpeg so that I 
can use this as height data image.

What exactly do I do within gdal_translate? I have tried such things 
as this:

C:\Downloads\gdal-114-ntbin\gdal114\bin>gdal_translate -of AIG 
gx25dem test.tif

With this response...

Size is 928, 918
0.ERROR 6: GDALDriver::Create() ... no create method implemented for 
this format
.

What am I doing wrong? 

Thanks
Rupert

Rupert, 

The "-of AIG" flag indicates the output format is AIG (ArcInfo Binary
Grid) but writing this format is not supported. If you want to translate
to GeoTIFF format use the "-of GTiff" flag or leave it off since GeoTIFF
is the default output format.

Because the source data is seen as type "Int32" an Int32 GeoTIFF file
will be produced. Most software cannot read Int32 GeoTIFF files so you
may need to use a gdal_translate option to alter the output type. Depending
on the range of data, and the program consuming the result appropriate
values might be "-ot UInt16" or "-ot Byte". 

Good luck,
