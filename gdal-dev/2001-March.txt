Simon, 

Correct, there are no arbitrary user defined fields. Embedding 
within something like the description is likely the best.

I often do it on close, but it can depend on the format.

Well, currently the metadata is usually just used for display to the
user. You are correct, meaningful use of the metadata would require
a deeper knowledge of the source.

Well, I could always use "TIFFTAG_%d" as the name, but that would be a
hack.

Things like the image description in TIFF have to be written before any 
image data is written. Essentially this would have to be done in the
Crystalize() method, with is the last opportunity to stuff in the 
directory. 

TIFF is a hairy case. 

Feel free to update the GeoTIFF driver, but let me know when you have
committed your changes so I can look them over.

Hi,

I've just CVS committed support for the FITS format in GDAL. The meat of
it is in the frmts/fits directory. From the documentation:

--

FITS -- Flexible Image Transport System

FITS is a format used mainly by astronomers, but it is a relatively
simple format that supports arbitrary image types and multi-spectral
images, and so has found its way into GDAL. FITS support is implemented
in terms of the standard CFITSIO library, which you must have on your
system in order for FITS support to be enabled. Both reading and writing
of FITS files is supported. At the current time, no support for a
georeferencing system is implemented, but WCS (World Coordinate System)
support is possible in the future. 

NOTE: Implemented as gdal/frmts/fits/fitsdataset.cpp.

--

configure looks for cfitsio on your system, and disables FITS support if
you don't have it.

If you get a chance to use the module and find it doesn't work quite as
advertized, please send bug reports to me. Frank, is there a way of
making Bugzilla do this?

One extra thing I hope to add in the very near future is a way of
reading and _writing_ arbitrary meta information from/to the FITS file
header.


It was a pleasure adding a module to such a well designed piece of
software. Thanks to Frank for making it all possible!


Cheers,

Sy

Hi, you can pick up some FITS images from:

http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~simes/tmp/los_alamos.fits.gz
http://nis-www.lanl.gov/~simes/tmp/specular_water.small.float.fits.gz

The first is a 1000x1000x4 byte image. 
The second is a 479x235x3 float image.

I submitted a small bug fix yesterday, and I'll be upgrading the header
info support later today hopefully.

Cheers,

Sy

Message-ID: <3AA83A58.E23834A4@l...>

Hi,

I have just checked in an update on the GDAL FITS driver that allows the
reading and writing of metadata to FITS files. From the ChangeLog:

Upon opening a FITS file, all non trivial headers are read from
the file and stored in the metadata store. Upon closing the FITS
file, any metadata associated with a name that is 8 characters or
less long, is written to the FITS file. The driver attempts to
guess the type of the metadata (double, long, logical or string)
and calls the appropriate fits update functions.

As far as I can tell this is the first driver which attempts to write
metadata to the file (rather than just read it), so I'd be interested in
any comments/criticisms on how I chose to do it. I'll probably add
something to GeoTIFF to do something similar with respect to the
standard tags that it stores in metadata. This functionality is required
for the application in which I'm using GDAL.

Cheers,

Sy

Ben, 

I have added read-only support for Arc/Info ascii grid files. Is that
sufficient? There are limitations in the .prj support (originating in
gdal/ogr/ogr_srs_esri.cpp, but I am willing to improve if it you give me
problematic .prj files. It does work with albers. 

I was impressed with the software and other material available at VTerrain.org
and I hope you will keep make further suggestions for cooperation and 
cross-fertilization. 

Note that GDAL itself isn't a projections tool. The OGRSpatialReference and
related C++ classes are loosely part of GDAL and are used for manipulating
projections using a normalized from based on OpenGIS Well Known Text format.
The PROJ.4 library is used for underlying reprojection of locations.

That is sufficient, particularly if it reads those Yukon DEMs.

Definitely. The VTP software is embarassingly weak in areas which GDAL
appears to be very strong, so it looks like a natural match.

Today i was able to download and build GDAL. It produced three (?) outputs,
gdal.lib (>6 MB!)
gdal_i.lib (117K)
gdal11.dll (2 MB)

I did not find a Readme to explain these. I presume that the _i is the link
library for the the DLL, and that gdal.lib is the static library?

It would be preferable to use a binary distribution, so that my users don't
each have to compile GDAL themselves, so i looked at the "Binaries of the
GDAL" from the site. It appears to contain a DLL and sample executables,
but not the headers, so people can't build their apps to use the DLL (?).

Thanks,
Ben

Ben, 

Charting is a weak point for me. I never seem interested enough to learn to
use a charting tool well. 

Briefly:

o OpenEV always uses GDAL for all raster access.
o OpenEV always can load shapefiles using shapelib.
o OpenEV can sometimes load any other OGR format, if built appropriately 
though it expects OGR to come from the GDAL shared library.
o OpenEV always uses OGRSpatialReference to manipulate projections, and
uses OGC WKT as the internal projection description format. 
o OpenEV always uses OGRCoordinateTransform for reprojection services, but
can mostly operate even if that doesn't work (if PROJ.4 isn't available).

o OGRSpatialReference, OGRCoordinateTransformation, OGR vectors and GDAL 
raster formats are all from the same source tree (in CVS) and can all be
compiled into one shared library (gdal11.dll or libgdal.1.1.so) 

o GDAL provides raster read/write services - the ogr stuff isn't considered
to be part of GDAL proper.
o GDAL utilizes various auxilary library (libjpeg, libtiff, libgeotiff, 
cfitslib, libpng, etc) for access to selected formats. Many of these can
be compiled into the dll from source in the GDAL tree, or dynamically
linked from pre-installed libraries on the system depending on how things
are configured. 
o Many GDAL formats uses OGRSpatialReference internally to prepare WKT
projection strings, so GDAL depends on having the OGRSpatialReference
class built-in.

o "OGR" is normally thought of as being the simple features portion of the
code under gdal/ogr, though the OGR projection services might be 
considered part of OGR as well. 
o OGR the vector library includes support for a variety of formats, including
Shapefiles, NTF, SDTS, Tiger, S-57, dgn and Mapinfo. 
o The OGR Mapinfo driver is a thin layer on top of MITAB. MITAB actually uses
some many OGR core classes internally, and the version of MITAB distributed
by Daniel include much of gdal/ogr/*.cpp. 
o OGR also depends on the OGRSpatialReference, and related projection classes.
o OGR can be utilized from an static library, but more commonly now is used
directly from an all-inclusive GDAL shared library. 

o OGRSpatialReference is just used for manipulating projection descriptions,
and transforming between different representations (WKT, PROJ.4, ESRI .prj, 
EPSG). The internal data model is that of OGC WKT. 
o OGRCoordinateTransformation supplies reprojection/datum shifting services, 
and internally uses PROJ.4. 
o OGRCoordinateTransformation dynamically loads PROJ.4 at run time, but
applications can link with it success (though reprojection will fail at run
time) even if PROJ.4 is not available. 

o PROJ.4 is PROJ.4, and is normally kept as a separate .dll/.so rather than
being linked into GDAL, or OpenEV. 

In case you didn't notice, I _do_ like point form.

OK, i have attempted to draw a quick chart, following your description.
Since i have not spent time the code itself, i'm sure it is inaccurate:
http://vterrain.org/Misc/Chart1.png

The big dotted box for GDAL is everthing that i'll expect to find in GDAL,
i.e. what you mention is in the same CVS tree, can be built into a single
library. The dashed lines to Shapelib and around OGR indicate that they are
optional.

One particular point is MITAB. I have drawn it as: The MapInfo part of OGR
uses MITAB, MITAB in turn calls parts of OGR. Is it so? Must MITAB be
built as a separate library? Is a version of it included with OGR, or with
GDAL?

> In case you didn't notice, I _do_ like point form.

Then i guess you'll like vterrain.org, it's 200 pages of hand-edited point
form notes - although the point form is trying to maintain a sense of
structure, when there often isn't one :-)

Just a very minor point: the FITS support in GDAL is built on top of
libcfitsio, not cfitslib!

Folks, 

I have prepared a 1.1.4 release of GDAL. Significant changes include:

o Addition of FITS format support. 
o Addition of Arc/Info ASCII Grid read.
o Added Envisat read support. 
o Improvements to gdal-config script.
o Fixed up python related install problems on Unix.
o Fixed GIF bugs on Windows. 
o Added ESRI .prj support for binary grids. 
o Added the DitherRGB2PCT and ComputeMedianCut algorithms in gdal/alg. 
o Added magnitude preserving averaging for overview computation. 
o Various other bug fixes. 

Source:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal-1.1.4.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal114.zip

I have also (uncharacteristically) prepare a windows binary distribution
right away, and in fact added a script so I can prepare them easily in 
the future (mk_win_bin_dist.sh). This distribution includes supporting csv
files, libraries include files and of course the dll and exe files. 

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal-114-winnt.zip

I would especially appreciate feedback on the windows binary distribution
and suggestions to improve it. Hopefully I will have linux and other
binaries soon as well as an RPM.

Ben, 

All the required MITAB source can be found within the GDAL source tree
(in gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/mitab), so no, MITAB need not be built separately.

The chart is nice ... what tool did you use for it? Unfortunately it doesn't
really express everything I would like. I always try to put too much into 
charts.

Indeed. Good only for prospective developers to get a rough idea of what's

Mark,

Thank you very much! With a minimum of reformatting I have applied your
code to CVS.

Best regards,

First, thanks for preparing a Win32 release. It looks like exactly what i'm
looking for, library and header.

I don't see "gdal-114-winnt.zip" on the server, but i do see these:

gdal-114-ntbin.zip (2 MB)
gdal-1142-ntbin.zip (5.6 MB)

The difference apparently is that "1142" has some newer files, and the file
"gdal.lib" is much larger. I suspect that "1142" is the one to use.

I added gdal1142/bin to my path, and tested it on an ArcInfo Binary Grid.
It appears to not find the projection/location information correctly, nor
the band type:

> gdalinfo 115h_90m.grd

Driver: EHdr/ESRI .hdr Labelled
Size is 1270, 1321
Coordinate System is `'
Origin = (0.000000,1.000000)
Pixel Size = (1.000000,-1.000000)
Corner Coordinates:
Upper Left ( 0.0000000, 1.0000000)
Lower Left ( 0.000, -1320.000)
Upper Right ( 1270.000, 1.000)
Lower Right ( 1270.000, -1320.000)
Center ( 635.000, -659.500)
Band 1 Block=1270x1 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Min=0.000/0, Max=255.000/0

I can uploaded the test file here i used, if needed.

Thanks,
Ben

Sorry about that. Yes, 1142 is the most up to date, though 114 isn't
far off. I don't really understand why the one .lib file is so different
in size from the other.

How sure are you that this is a binary grid, and not (as gdalinfo reports)
an ESRI labelled BIL? If you send me the file I will see what I can do
to get georeferencing support working properly. Just drop it in 
ftp://gdal.velocet.ca/pub/incoming and let me know. 

Thanks,

Ben,

I am sure the files were created with Arc/Info Grid, but their aren't
in ascii or binary grid formats. They are in a strange form of ESRI labelled
BIL but with lots of differences (presumably because they come out of Grid). 

I have done a bunch of work fixing up the ESRI BIL driver to support this
variations, and can now load and display the data in OpenEV with no problem,
including processing the projection. 

I would also note that the NODATA value is carried through GDAL in case
you want that. 

Best regards,

Fascinating. Great to hear that GDAL can now handle them.

Indeed, that is very useful - i currently allow the user to load multiple
overlapping elevation rasters, display with the NODATA masked out, then
merge them and patch up NODATA areas, so that's an important feature.

Message-ID: <9a378g+haoj@eGroups.com>

Greetings, I'm new to the list but was wondering what needs to take 
place to include additional image formats. Has anyone been looking 
at ERMapper's ECW format? We are using it quite extensively and I am 
trying out OpenEV and since it depends on gdal I thought I'd ask 
about it here.
Would love to know your thoughts. I've never developed image 
reading/writing code before, but I know that there is a SDK available 
for this format, how hard could it be to integrate to gdal?
