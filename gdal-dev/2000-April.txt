Folks,

I have worked up a very simple GDAL API tutorial. I am also hoping to develop
a "how to write a GDAL driver" tutorial in the near future. The existing
tutorial can be found at:

http://gdal.velocet.ca/gdal/html/gdal_tutorial.html

I have also checked a bunch of code in this week for building overviews on a
dataset, including a convenient way of adding external overviews in a TIFF file
associated with other formats so that most drivers can easily have a form
of overview support if desired.

Best regards,
