Hi all,
thanks for a great library of code, I am looking forward to some
fun programming. 

My problem is with reading Arc/Info Binary Grids, and more specifically
with getting prjection information from them.

to get started I used code from the tutorial page to open and get
information on the coverage, but can't seem to get projection information.

The relevant bi of code is :
if (GDALGetProjectionRef (hDataset) != NULL)
printf ("Projection is `%s'\n", GDALGetProjectionRef (hDataset));

if (GDALGetGeoTransform (hDataset, adfGeoTransform) == CE_None)
{
printf ("Origin = (%.6f,%.6f)\n",
adfGeoTransform[0], adfGeoTransform[3]);

printf ("Pixel Size = (%.6f,%.6f)\n",
adfGeoTransform[1], adfGeoTransform[5]);
}

and the output is :
f2 [gdal]> ./test farah
Driver: AIGrid/Arc/Info Binary Grid
Size is 2895x2689x1
Projection is `'
Block=256x4 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Undefined
Min=78.000, Max=238.000


So you can see DALGetProjectionRef (hDataset) returns an empty string, and
GDALGetGeoTransform (hDataset, adfGeoTransform) returns CE_failure.

Behaviour on imagine files seems ok:

f2 [gdal]> ./test /p11/riparian/dtms/coverages/64676964grdll.img
Driver: HFA/Erdas Imagine Images (.img)
Size is 967x1001x1
Projection is `PROJCS["UTM",GEOGCS["WGS 84",DATUM["WGS 84",SPHEROID["WGS
84",6378137,298.257223563002],TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]],PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],PARAMETER["central_meridian",153],PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],PARAMETER["false_northing",10000000],UNIT["Meter",1]]'
Origin = (466999.500000,6965000.500000)
Pixel Size = (1.000000,-1.000000)
Block=64x64 Type=Float32, ColorInterp=Undefined
Min=0.000, Max=132.455
Band has 3 overviews.

Can anyone suggest what the problem might be?

Robert,

There is no problem with your code. The Arc/Info grid reader just doesn't
do any translation of projection information. In my experience relatively
few binary grid coverages have .prj files, and implementing good translation
of .prj to OpenGIS WKT is not a trivial job. However, once done it could
be useful in other contexts as well, so I am interested it doing it eventually.
Perhaps it would be a good idea to do some simple translation now.

What does your .prj file look like in your grid coverage?

Best regards,

Frank,
the projection information is in a file prj.adf, and looks like:
f2 [64676964grd1l]> cat prj.adf
PROJECTION UTM
UNITS meters
SPHEROID WGS84
DATUM WGS84
PARAMETERS
153 0 0
-40 0 0

Most of the grid files we deal with here have prj.adf file.

Robert,

I have added limited support for parsing prj.adf files to the AIGrid reader
(most of the code is in OGRSpatialReference::importFromESRI() in 
gdal/ogr/ogr_srs_esri.cpp). However, your file will not work. How is the
zone supposed to be established from your prj.adf file? Why does a UTM
projection have parameters in the parameters list?

Best regards,

Chak,

This seems to be some sort of difference between the version of zlib you
have installed, and the includes files GDAL is using (from gdal/frmts/zlib).
I would suggest rerunning configure with --with-libz=internal.

eg.
% configure --with-libz=internal

Frank,
it appears there are two ways to specifiy the projection information
for UTM here. The one you might be more familiar with looks like this:

f2 [site1biggrd2m]> cat prj.adf
Projection UTM 
Zone 56 
Zunits NO 
Units METERS 
Spheroid AUSTRALIANNATIONAL 
Xshift 0.0000000000 
Yshift -10000000.0000000000 
Parameters 

This contain no parameters, and zone information etc is referenced
directly. The other:

> > f2 [64676964grd1l]> cat prj.adf
> > PROJECTION UTM
> > UNITS meters
> > SPHEROID WGS84
> > DATUM WGS84
> > PARAMETERS
> > 153 0 0
> > -40 0 0
is actually the result of exporting an imagine .img file to a grid. It
seems that enough information is there to set the zone and offset ok (for
example the central meridian of zone 56 is 153, and presumably -40 is
equivalent to a y offset of -10000000. 

I think I will try to use native arc/info grids, rather than the converted
ones from imagine, but this might be something to think about in future.

thanks for you help.

Robert

Dear gdal-dev,
I am a bit confused reading data from an ERDAS Imagine
File. Using the tutorial as a guide I wrote a test program which just
prints out the values of the image in col/row order, just like the imagine
pixel->ascii function. Unfortunately it doesn't quite match up with the
imagine equivalent, but seems to duplicate the final pixel in each line.

let me show you:
The tree columns on the left are my results, the three on the right are
imagine results.
first line is fine, but the first value on the second line is the same as
the last value on he line above, which puts everything out.

hBand = GDALGetRasterBand (hDataset, 1);
nXSize = GDALGetRasterBandXSize (hBand);
nYSize = GDALGetRasterBandYSize (hBand);
pafScanline = (float *) CPLMalloc (sizeof (float) * nXSize * nYSize);
GDALRasterIO (hBand, GF_Read, 0, 0, nXSize, nYSize,
pafScanline, nXSize, nYSize, GDT_Float32, 0, 0);

for(col=0;col<nXSize;col++) {
printf("%d %d %f\n",col,row, pafScanline[row*nYSize+col]);
}
}

This might be a simple programming error but I'm not too proud to have the
obvious pointed out to me.

Thanks fro any suggestions,

Actually I solved my problem by using a multidimensional array, which has
the advantage of being able to reference any pixel by scanline[row][col]. 

On another point, I have been having some difficulties working with img
files that have been created under windows. I am working on solaris
unix. If I open these img files under unix imageine and save them as
something else he problem disappears. Anyone have any suggestions as to
what migh be happening here?

G?nter,

The error message is coming from the GXF Grid reader. After the

is presumably working), it calls GDALOpen() to reopen the file for read
access. 

GDALOpen() calls all the drivers in order, but unfortunately the GXF 
driver occationally recognises a file improperly as GXF and tries to read
it. If later, it finds the file is missing important information (ie. 
the #GRID directive) it produces an error which terminates open as GXF
_and also stops GDALOpen() to going on to the next driver_! This is
intentional, so that error messages about corrupt files can be reported
to the user. 

The real problem then is that the GXF drivers "test" for GXFishness is
weak, and one of the particular jpeg files you wrote was mistakenly 
recognised as GXF. In fact I have run into this once or twice myself
but I didn't really understand what had gone wrong.

I have taken the following steps to correct the problem:

o I have moved GXF near the bottom of the driver list in GDALAllRegister()
so it won't generally be called till all other drivers have been tried. 

o I have modified gxfdataset.cpp::Open() so that a "zero" character anywhere
in the header is recognised as invalidating the file as being GXF. This
will likely eliminate any problems for JPEG. 

Are you working with the current source of GDAL from CVS, or a copy from
last year? If you are working with an old copy, and are not eager to upgrade
to the current code I would suggest just removing the GDALRegister_GXF()
call from GDALAllRegister() for now. 

> Thanks a lot (and greetings from Arno Sch?pe, eCognition Group)

My best regards to everyone. I tried the focuServer, and it looks cool. 
Are you interested in support for generating progressive JPEGs for this? 
I could see this being a useful improvement, though it seems fast and smooth
enough to me now.

PS. I have taken the liberty of cc:ing this message to the GDAL mailing list.
I hope you don't mind, but others might run into related problems.

Best regards,

Robert,

I have added support for using the Yshift to detect UTM in the
southern hemisphere.

I have added support for this formulation as well. I am assuming that any
negative value for the second parameter indicates southern hemisphere, and
otherwise using northern hemisphere.

Robert,

I would appreciate it if you could provide me an example Imagine file created
under windows that doesn't work under unix. Perhaps you could drop a 
relatively small example in pub/incoming on gdal.velocet.ca for me to test
with.

Thanks,

Message-ID: <3A1ED5DC.FAAC972C@p...>

Folks, 

I have done a bunch of work on the libgeotiff library (in CVS) to make it
easy to build as a shared library. GDAL's configure has been changed so it
can easily use pre-installed libtiff.so and libgeotiff.so files though this
can be overridden to use the internal code to the true using 
--with-libtiff=internal and/or --with-geotiff=internal. 

Let me know if you encounter any problems.

Hi Gdal Developers,

when building the gdal rpm, I noticed that the --exec-prefix
flag to gdal's configure did not work.

Therefore I have send a patch to Frank, which should be in the CVS now.
(A second one will follow, with minor cosmetic changes.)

Keep it in mind an check the path for the install directories 
in your next gdal build from cvs.

Best Regards,
Bernhard

Hi,

the Intevation GmbH created the first test gdal rpm for i386
to be included in the next FreeGIS-CD release.

You can get it from:

ftp://intevation.de/freegis/gnu-linux-i586/updates/

Let us know if it works fine.

Subject: Future of OGR within GDAL
Message-ID: <NEBBIENNGLHJFNCDFBGEMECOCAAA.awaxman@s...>

Hi,

I have been playing around with GDAL a little bit the last few days and like
what I see.
I was wondering what the future of OGR is since I am developing tools that
display both use vector and raster.

Also I see that there are no C wrappers around most of the OGR pieces as
there is for raster. Is this intended for the future? It sounds like a
good place where I could start to contribute.

Thanks,

Andy

Andy, 

I am continuing to develop OGR. A DGN reader (and perhaps eventually writer)
is underway at this time. I am doing work to track recent developments in
the area of OGC coordinate transforms (projections) efforts.

I haven't done C bindings for the OGRFeature/OGRGeometry/OGRLayer family of
stuff (though I have for the OGRSpatialReference classes). You are welcome
to implement them. 

Best regards,

Subject: gdal_merage.py
Message-ID: <3A256A88.CCC8DFF7@p...>

Folks, 

I have implemented a relatively simple Python script for merging many GDAL
datasets into one. It can be found in gdal/pymod, and called gdal_merge.py.

Usage: gdal_merge.py [-o out_filename] [-f out_format] [-v]
[-ps pixelsize_x pixelsize_y]
[-ul_lr ulx uly lrx lry] input_files


For instance the following would create a TIFF file called test.tif, with the
extents 138-139Longitude, 34-35Latitude from all the "*.mem" files. The -v
flag indicates verbose output. The pixel size in this case is defaulted based
on the pixel size of the first input file. 

gdal_merge.py -v -ul_lr 138 35 139 34 -o test.tif *.mem

The output format, and pixel size can also be overriden with commandline 
switches. By default the extents of the whole file set are used. 

This utility does not:
o Have any knowledge of "background values". The last file copied in always
overwrites anything underneath the area of the output file it overlaps. 

o Have any knowledge of the projection, nor does it set the projection 
information on the output file. In particular, it won't reproject files
in different projections to a common output projection. It is assumed that
all input files are in the same effective coordinate systems. 

o Handle auxilary information like colortables and so forth. 

o It does not provide control of the pixel type of the output file. It is
set to be the same as the first input file. 

Note the output file can be pre-existing in which case projection, pixel type
and other information could have been set more carefully ahead of time by some
other mechanism. 

I would like to thank Atlantis Scientific (http://www.atlsci.com/) who funded
this work, as well as the recent addition of Japanese DEM format to GDAL.

Best regards,

Justin, 

The problem is (I think) that the pngdataset.cpp file is compiled based
on the png include files distributed with gdal, but tries to link against
the installed png (by default). This is intended to make it easier to link
against a pre-installed libpng even if you didn't install the corresponding
development package. However, in practice there seems to be enough variation
in the actual libpng.so's people have installed to make this a bad idea. 

You can get around this problem with the configure switch --with-png=internal
to compile and link in the png code distributed with gdal. I should likely
move the png code, and include files into a subdirectory, and avoid including
the include files in the include path when using external libpng; however, 
I am hesitant to do that. 

I am changing the AC_CHECK_LIB() call in configure.in to look for png_set_IHDR
instead of the old function it was looking for. Hopefully this will make it
easier to segregate out the version of libpng to link against. Perhaps you
could cvs update, and reconfigure with my new configure to see if this test
successfully switches things to "internal" png mode?

Also, could you provide an "ls -l /usr/lib/libpng*" report, and any other
information on the version of libpng you have installed?

Note, the same sorts of issues can arise with libtiff, and libjpeg. The 
build information on the GDAL page does briefly address the need to use 
internal versions of libraries in some cases.
