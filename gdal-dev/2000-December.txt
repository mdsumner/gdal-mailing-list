Vasilakos, 

There are a number of possible header formats, but I prefer PCI .aux. The
full description is at:

http://www.pcigeomatics.com/cgi-bin/pcihlp/GDB|Supported+File+Formats|Raw+Binary+Image+Format+(RAW)|Raw+.aux+Format

But in short, to describe a 1000x1000x5 band BIP eight bit file called avhrr.raw 
you would need to write out a file called avhrr.aux looking like this:

AuxilaryTarget: avhrr.raw
RawDefinition: 1000 1000 5
ChanDefinition-1: 8U 0 5 5000
ChanDefinition-2: 8U 1 5 5000
ChanDefinition-3: 8U 2 5 5000
ChanDefinition-4: 8U 3 5 5000
ChanDefinition-5: 8U 4 5 5000

To access the file in GDAL use the name of the raw file, avhrr.raw, and GDAL
will check for a corresponding .aux file. 

Once this is written you should be able to use gdal_translate.exe to
convert the dataset to other formats:

eg.

C:> gdal_translate -of GTiff avhrr.raw avhrr.tif
C:> gdal_translate -of JPEG avhrr.raw avhrr.jpg

Let me know if you need more information. 

Best regards,

Doug, 

Could you provide me a sample.

The JPEG reader does not support .jwf files. In fact, I only added .tfw 
support for the TIFF reader today! I will put .jwf files on my todo list.

Do you really mean .twf? I have always seen these as .tfw (or a few times in
the old days .tifw on Unix). 

As for a few of your other notes:

o There are no plans for MrSID support in GDAL at this time. The last time
I talked with the MrSID people they has fairly restrictive requirements
to do anything with their libraries. 
o There is no support for arc/info coverages in OGR at this time, but there
are plans to add them, as well as e00 files. There is arc/info binary
grid support already. 

Note, that the issues you raise are predominately related to GDAL, though the
upsidedown lat/long thing is an OpenEV issue.
