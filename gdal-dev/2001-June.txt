Folks, 

I have written up a tutorial on how to implement drivers for GDAL. It can
be found at:

Petri, 

I tried under cygwin just now, and ran into the same problem. 

I would advise you to use the internal versions of a few libraries:

./configure --with-libtiff=internal --with-geotiff=internal --with-jpeg=internal

This works for me now, though I had a few problems in the mitab code as well.
If you run into this either add "--without-ogr" to the configure, or update
to the latest GDAL code from CVS. 

Note, that configure on Cygwin doesn't know how to build a shared library,
so the results are going to be of limited value anyways. If you want to
build your own application against GDAL do it the way that gdalinfo does
in gdal/apps/GNUmakefile. This is a "static" link rather than trying to
link against gdal.1.1.so like the rest of the tools.

Finally, cygwin isn't exactly a supported environment for GDAL but if there
are simple things I can do to fix up gdal to work under Cygwin I will. 

Best regards,

Ok, I managed to compile GDAL almost completely, the compilation stopped in 
the apps-directory, when linking 'gdal_translate', as might be expected 
because it tries to link with the shared lib. Please note that I really 
only need the support for TIFF-files, or rather, GeoTIFF-files. So I 
modified the GDALmake.opt to include only TIFF-format, because all my 
raster files are in that format.

However, now I'm wondering, that why I need to link with ogr.a eventhough I 
have set in GDALmake.opt:
OGR_ENABLED = no

I don't think that I need to have OGR for anything, as I use shapelib to 
read in ESRI Shapefiles. My application doesn't have to be prepared to read 
all possible formats, only ESRI Shapefile and GeoTIFF are needed.

In my own makefile, I link with:
GDALFILES = $(gdaldir)/gdal.a $(gdaldir)/cpl.a $(gdaldir)/gdal.a 
$(gdaldir)/ogr.a

I'm a bit confused also for having to include gdal.a twice on that line, 
otherwise the linking fails.

But then something more frustrating:

------------

You can see that -lm is missing, i guess that causes the above errors. BUT, 
when I link with -lm, the linking succeeds, but my program hangs on 
startup. Even if I try to print something from the beginning of 
main-function, nothing is printed. It seems as if my main program hangs 
already in some library initialisation code. If I remove all references to 
GDAL in my code and remove the linking of the .a-files, then my program works.

Any ideas?

PS. Note that I had to define -Dunix=1 to avoid some ifdef:ed INT64-stuff 
in GDAL-code.
