Subject: GDAL 1.1.1 Release
Message-ID: <39D00894.A037032E@h...>


Folks, 

I have prepared a new GDAL source release, hereby dubbed 1.1.1.

The release files may be found at:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal-1.1.1.tar.gz
ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal111.zip

Unfortunately I don't keep good ChangeLog records for GDAL yet, so
I can't really tell you whats changed, but changes include:

o Support for reading GRASS raster layers (via libgrass5).

o Improved GeoTIFF support, including auto-translation of 1bit files,
YCbCr and some other odd files into RGBA format on read. 

o Addition of OGDI Raster Support (not in default builds because of
conflicts between OGDI PROJ.4 version and the current one). 

o Added projection, and georeferencing support for PCI .aux format,
and Erdas Imagine format.

o Added Supported Formats documentation.

o Made some improvements for building. It mostly builds ok out of
the box with Cygwin, though the shared library stuff doesn't seem
to work properly. 

There is also a build of linux binaries available with the following 
information in the README:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/gdal-1.1.1_linux_bin.tar.gz

This build should be suitable for use with the new r.in.gdal I have been
working on for GRASS. 


GDAL Linux Binary Distribution
==============================

It is suggested that libgdal.1.1.so, libgrass5.so, and libproj.so go somewhere 
in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, perhaps /usr/local/lib, and that gdalinfo, 
gdal_translate and gdaladdo go somewhere in the regular path, such as 
/usr/local/bin. 

libgdal.1.1.so depends on the C++ runtime library. If you don't have a
compatible version installed, you should be able to copy 
libstdc++-libc6.1-2.so.3 to the same place as the libgdal-1.1.so. 

Documentation on supported formats can be found at:

http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/formats_list.html

This release include builtin support for JPEG, and PNG (doesn't require
separate libraries) as well as GRASS support. OGDI support is not included.

This release does include all of OGR built into the library (as per the
--with-ogr configure flag), including the OGRSpatialReference services 
(partially dependent on libproj.so, and having the EPSG CVS files installed 
-- not included).

Subject: ChangeLog
Message-ID: <39D23D59.AB662F4E@h...>

Folks, 

After resisting for a long time, I have finally added a ChangeLog in the gdal
root directory. Please add a note in the usual format if you make any non
trivial fix, or improvement to GDAL, port, or a GDAL format driver. For now
we won't include OGR changes unless they are likely to affect other aspects. 

BTW, I have rolled out an r.in.gdal command in GRASS that uses GDAL to import
raster data into GRASS format. With luck some folks in the GRASS community 
may start to extend GDAL as a way of adding importers to GRASS. 

Best regards,

Subject: OpenEV 0.9.0 Release
Message-ID: <39D407DE.60DFB005@h...>

Folks,

I am pleased to announce the 0.9.0 release of OpenEV. Binaries are available
for Windows 98/NT/2000, Linux, Solaris and Irix. Source, further details, 
mailing lists and so forth are available at:

http://openev.sourceforge.net/

OpenEV is an application for viewing and analysing raster and vector geospatial data. 

Objectives - OpenEV will: 
Run on popular platforms (Linux, Windows, Solaris, IRIX). 
Handle raster and vector data. 
Support 2d and 3d display. 
Gracefully handle very large (gigabyte) raster datasets. 
Support multi-channel, and complex raster datasets. 
Understand and interpret georeferencing information, and provide on-the-fly 
reprojection of datasets. 
Provide view manipulation functions (pan, zoom, rotate) at interactive frame rates. 
Provide a powerful image analysis tool. 
Serve as a component in a variety of image analysis applications. 

OpenEV utilizes OpenGL, Python, Gtk+, GDAL, and PROJ.4 technologies.

I believe OpenEV's current strengths are:
o High performance display of even very large images. 
o Support for 16bit, floating point and complex raster display with
sensible scaling, and display access to the underlying raster values. 
o Highly customizable, and extendible since the GUI is written in Python. 
o 3D support.

I think that OpenEV can grow into:
o similar uses as IDL due to integration of GDAL, OpenEV and Numerical Python.
o Sophisicated GIS vector display as improvements are made to rendering, and
integration with OGR (my vector library) tightens up. 
o As a display front end for GRASS, as GDAL is upgraded to use libgrass, and 
some level of integration with GRASS commands is achieved. 
o As a data translator, and transformer as GDAL export capabilities are 
more fully utilized. 
o A very projection savvy environment, once a user projection definition
dialog is implemented, and vector on-the-fly reprojection is implemented. 

Areas I think OpenEV is currently weaker than it could be:
o It's dependence on OpenGL can cause a substantial performance hit on 
unaccelerated platforms, especially doing 3D viewing, and vector editing
operations. Many of the difficult to fix, and reproduce bugs also seem
to be OpenGL related.
o It depends on quite a few packages, which can make it a bit of a job
to build completely from source. 
o Programmer documentation is not up to the desired level. 
o Very limited image analysis tools available. 
o Vector integration isn't up to what you would expect of a vector 
focused package (which OpenEV is not). 

I believe OpenEV can be a very useful package as it stands today, and I 
encourage folks looking for a comfortable, customizable, extendable 
raster, and vector viewing environment to considering downloading and trying
it out. 

I, and the OpenEV team are also keen on finding other developers interested
in improving and extending OpenEV. 

Note, I have sent this to a number of lists, and newsgroups. I appologise
to those getting this message multiple times.

Best regards,

Subject: Problems with TIFF CCITT T.6
Message-ID: <39D49F82.BCFCB12B@c...>

Hi Gurus,
downloaded OpenEV 0.9.0 this morning.
Nice, very nice ...
only ( ? ) TIFF CCITT T.6 are not working. At loading such an image
I get a Box from the system ( Windows NT 4.0 SP 6 ) wich tell me, that there
is an unhandled exception ( 0xC0000005:Access Violation ).
I love bugs, about that I have searched for it. Then I'm smiling ...
I have only debugged GDAL 1.1.1.
Unfortenly it is a little bit complicated. About that more then one line:

GDALOpen is called from _GV!011cffc6 ( don't know what it is )
with the eAccess GA_Update, this is mapped in GTiffDataset::Open to
"r+".
TIFFClientOpen maps this to O_RDWR.
Some lines later TIFFClientOpen calls ... -> ... -> InitCCITTFax3.
There is allocated a Fax3EncodeState because the mode is not O_RDONLY
( we know, it is O_RDWR ). Some lines later the structure is initialisized -
with values for encoding, not decoding.
Later TIFFReadRGBAStrip is called which calls ...->...-> Fax3PreDecode.
There is a cast from tif->tif_data to Fax3DecodeState *.
The access to sp->refruns[0] raises then the exception because the value is not
null, but also not a valid pointer.

OK, where is the bug. May be it is philosophic.
Is it not allowed to open a file with r+ if we would read the image ( then
the bug is in GDAL or OpenEV).
Or is it not allowed to detect the read/write state at the file open mode
( then the bug is in libtiff ). In libtiff ( tif_fax3.c ) there are more than one
if (tif->tif_mode == O_RDONLY)
may be a little bit difficult to change it.
Frank will be happy ( i like his comments in tif_fax3.c )
libtiff is not able to update an TIFF file, about that r+ makes no sense (or ??).
Or is the bug to click on a TIFF CCITT T.6 ?

Good that Frank manages both libs ...

Klaus

Klaus, 

I have had no problem reproducing this bug. :-) A few points:

o OpenEV tries to open files with update access, and if that fails falls
back to read-only access. 

o GDAL trusts TIFFOpen() to fail if the underlying file really can't be
accessed in update mode. 

o I did some hacks to libtiff over the last year or so to allow 
"sort of update access" in some cases that it wouldn't otherwise be 
practical. Amoung other things this is important if you want to add
overviews to an existing file. I think I will have to trace through
some of the compression schemes and see how they determine their mode.
I think libtiff needs a concept of compressed files with read-only
access to existing imagery but update access to the file as a whole. 

I am entering your report into the libtiff bug database, and will fix it as
soon as I can. 

Finally, the OpenEV 0.9.0 uses a version of GDAL that doesn't work sensibly
with bitonal images anyways. I modified GDAL recently to translate odd
photometric interpretations, and images with < 8 bits/sample into RGBA format
on the fly. With a little luck there will be an OpenEV 1.0.0 release within
a few weeks that incorporates the updated GDAL.
