Subject: Borland C++ compiler patch and makefiles
Message-ID: <200102220448.MAA13247@m...>


Hi!

I like Borland C/C++ Compiler and I prepared a number Makefiles for gdal (and some patches also to make sourece compile).

Is it possible to include it in next distribution?

Some words on the patch:

1. makefile.b32 in each directory is similar as makefile and makefile.vc, but without variable OBJ (that contains object code file names). The .obj files connected by means of included objlist.make file (for each directory). So, to reduce redundand data (.obj list files) I can reform all makefile.vc to include objlist.mak in them. So when project file list is changed it vould be possible to correct onli objlist.mak file to make changes actual for both vc and bcc compilers.

2. 2 files (shapeopen.c and one of jpeg library) didn't want to compile, I corrected accordingli (see patch)

3. OGR's OLE do not compile at all as I have no MIDL compiler. Is it possible to include results of MIDL in the distribution?
So, not all test??.exe is compiled.


Sincerely,

Evegny Cherkashin

Folks, 

For now it is of rather specialized interest, but Envisat read support
has been incorporated into GDAL. This file format will be used for
distribution products from the Envisat radar satellite to be lanched this
summer. 

Best regards,

Subject: Random questions about GDAL file formats
Message-ID: <3A9B0E68.9F58D334@l...>

Hi,

(1) For a while I've been looking for a non-proprietary image format
that supports multi-spectral imagery in a standard way. In theory TIFF
would seem like a good candidate since it allows the samplesPerPixel tag
to be set to an aribtrary number. I think GDAL supports this (from
looking at the source code - haven't tried it yet), but I have yet to
find any other packages, including GIS / image processing systems that
recognize this tag. Does anyone know which standard image processing/GIS
packages support multispectral TIFF? Or is there some other
non-proprietary multispectral format that is more widely understood?
Multispectral PNG anyone?

(2) When using TIFF with GDAL, what compression is used as standard? Is
there any way of adjusting this?

(3) I've written a couple of remote-sensing image applications that use
FITS as a multispectral file format. FITS is really an astronomy format,
but it's simple, non-proprietary, reasonably easy to find tools for, and
supports multispectral images as standard. I'd like to start using GDAL
to support more standard formats, but I'd also like to preserve support
for FITS for backward compatibility. Would anyone be interested in a
GDAL driver for FITS based on the standard cfitsio library?


Cheers,

Sy

Simon, 

I am reasonably sure that PCI, Erdas and Intergraph all have some degree
of support for SamplerPerPixel other than 1. In part this is driven by
USGS DEMs and Space Imaging data distributed as sixteen bits per pixel. 

I am also pretty sure that PCI, Intergraph and Erdas support an arbitrary
number of bands in TIFF.

None compression is standard. The COMPESS=[JPEG,LZW,PACKBITS,DEFLATE,NONE]
option can be used to set the compression. I think I normally build without
LZW support enabled. 

On the gdal_translate command line this would be accomplished with the
-co (create option) commandline switch. 

ie. 
gdal_translate -co "COMPRESS=JPEG" irvine.tif irvine_jpeg.tif

The creation options are all visible on the TIFF help page at:

http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/frmt_gtiff.html

I would be pleased to have FITS support in GDAL, but I see the cfitsio
library is a substantial chunk of code. Would you approach this by
adding something to configure to search for libcfitsio.a, and determine
based on that whether to configure in fits support? 

Would you like some help setting up a code skeleton for fits support
that you could glue the detailed calls into? 

Best regards,
