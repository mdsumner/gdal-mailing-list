Folks, 

It seems like a simple thing, but I finally added a list of GDAL supported 
formats and some details off the GDAL web page. 

See: http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/formats_list.html

The pszHelpTopic field of the various drivers has also been set, so it should,
in theory, be possible to automatically display the help topic for a format. 

Best regards,
