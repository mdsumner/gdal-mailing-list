Pierre,

In the released code there is no way to do this; however, I have just added
the QUALITY=n option in the code in CVS. I also wrote a brief web page
documenting the JPEG driver, at:

http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/frmt_jpeg.html

I have also prepared a new release of the code which I have dubbed 1.1.1.
It can be found in ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal

Let me know if this does the trick.

Best regards,

Pierre,

The comment lines were confusing my driver. I have updated it. This fix 
should be in the new source distribution on ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal.

Hi all,

I would like to know how to use the Dataset's Method : BuildOverviews.

I don't know what to set for :
- panOverviewList
- pfnProgress
- pProgressData

My aim is to use it for making small image of the main one. (~10 x
smaller ).

Wich format does support to build such Overviews inside.(I know TIFF
can, but others ? )

Thanks for all.

Pierre

Hi,

It's possible to read multiple Directories of a TIFF image with the GDAL
?
And palette color images ?

Best regards,

Pierre.

Pierre,

Palette color TIFF files should be supported properly. You can use the
GDALGetRasterColorTable() to fetch back the color table, and there is an 
API for getting the color entries back from that. Let me know if you encounter
any problems with this.

There is not currently any user accessable support for reading additional
directories in the TIFF file as separate images, though GDAL does know how
to build reduced resolution images for TIFF files (as additional directories)
and how to use them. 

If you really need access to multi-page TIFF files let me know, and I can 
enable it via a special encoding of the directory number in the filename. I
have done this in the past in a couple of other systems. 

Best regards,

List of overview reduction factors. For instance {2, 4, 8} on a base image
of 1024x1024 would give a 512x512, 256x256 and 128x128 overview. 

> - pfnProgress

I have added documentation this morning. See GDALDummyProgress() on the
gdal.h page:

http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/gdal.h.html

> My aim is to use it for making small image of the main one. (~10 x

You should be able to pass panOverviewList={10} to get a 10x10 reduction.
Do you want this to be a separate file, or do you just want it for
accelerated loads with RasterIO()? 

> Wich format does support to build such Overviews inside.(I know TIFF
> can, but others ? )

The SAR_CEOS, CEOS, JPEG, PNG, EFF, ESRI BIL, MFF, and PCI .aux formats 
currently support external overviews (build in a .ovr file).

Keep the questions coming, and I will try to update the documentation as
things come up.

In fact both of them could interest me.
First I need a separate file for having a look over a huge image.
But accelerating loads with RasterIO could be interesting for me too.

Thanks,

Pierre.

Subject: NumPy Integration
Message-ID: <39762D8E.C3D7C981@h...>

Folks, 

Preliminary integration of GDAL and OpenEV with NumPy is now checked in.
The following shows a simple example of loading a GDAL supported file 
into a NumPy array (using the gdalnumeric.LoadFile() function), manipulating
it to produce a new array, and then opening them both as GDAL datasets for
display in OpenEV.

from Numeric import *
import gdalnumeric

array = gdalnumeric.LoadFile( "/u/data/mff/test.hdr" )
array2 = array * -1
app.file_open_by_name(gdalnumeric.GetArrayFilename(array))
app.file_open_by_name(gdalnumeric.GetArrayFilename(array))

Details on the methods available are currently only available in 
gdal.py, and gdalnumeric.py. Some issues are:

o The LoadFile(), and ReadAsArray() methods on the gdal.Dataset, and gdal.Band
currently make an intermediate binary string copy of the data read from the
GDAL file, before turning it into a NumPy array. This is potentially is
somewhat less efficient than creating the NumPy array directly but avoids
us needing to link directly against NumPy shared libraries. 

o GDAL supports NumPy arrays as a special format. The filename passed to the
gdal.Open() call should be "NUMPY:::0xhhhhhhhh" with the h's containing the
hex pointer value of the python array object. The 
gdalnumeric.GetArrayFilename() function can be used to create this for any
array. 

o GDAL adds a reference to the opened array, and releases it when the file
is closed. This should prevent memory leaks, or unexpected crashes, 
assuming the gdal handle gets closed properly.

o GDAL supports almost all the types of numeric python arrays, including 
float32, float64, int32, and complex types. It does not include int64,
float128, int8, "object" arrays, or char arrays. If this is a problem, 
I could have the OpenArray() method cast these other types, or event cast
the numeric ones in C. 

o GDAL support for numpy arrays doesn't involve any duplication of data. 
The gdal access is to the same underlying memory. It is possible to
update numpy arrays in-place with some (all?) ufuncs, which should be
reflected in the next read from GDAL. However, GDAL doesn't know when 
the data has changed, and neither does the application. OpenEV will tend
to cache data in the GvRaster, and won't realize if this has been 
invalidated. 

o I have been careful to make it so that numpy support in GDAL can be built 
without numeric python actually having to be installed on the build system,
or the system the binary is run on. However, attempting to load gdalnumeric,
or call numpy related methods on gdal.Dataset, or gdal.Band without having
numpy installed will result in a python exception at the point where
the attempt to "import Numeric" is made. 

I don't have any immediate plans for more work on numpy integration with 
GDAL. The next stage is integrating a python command tool in OpenEV, which
is tentatively Steve's job. However, even now it should be practical for 
anyone interested to try writing numpy scripts for image manipulation loading
and saving through GDAL. I would be happy to provide support to anyone wanting
to try.

Subject: GDAL/OGR Build Changes for Windows
Message-ID: <39770FD3.99B3BCA4@h...>

Folks, 

I have made a few reorganizations in order to facilitate inclusion of OGR in
gdal11.dll. In particular, the SDTS and ISO8211 object files are no longer
dumped into gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/ogrsf_frmts.lib, but are now put in a
separate gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/ogrsf_frmts_sup.lib file.

I have also changed the high level gdal makefile.vc to build all the OGR
formats into gdal11.dll (and gdal.lib) by default though this can be
modified with commenting and uncommenting some lines in the gdal/makefile.vc.

Anyone working from cvs is encouraged to do a cvs update, and clean build 
when they have a chance (and a bit of time to deal with possible headaches).
