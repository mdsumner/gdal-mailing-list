Hi,

You can do what Even suggested in
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2016-November/045615.html:
download and save GetCapabilities on the disk, edit, and read the edited
GetCapabilities with GDAL.

You're right of course about 'layers' not accepting a string if you try to
specify a single layer, i noticed that mistake in my code later on as well.
Its not affecting the behavior i'm experiencing. I work in the Jupyter
Notebook and that moves you away from the console where the GDAL warnings
are printed, which is why i didn't noticed it right away. GDAL prints a nice
'ERROR 1: Couldn't fetch requested layer 'a'!' warning which makes the
sliced string obvious.

Good to know that it should work like that, i started off with something
similar. 

After some more trial and error i think I've found whats wrong. I was first
really focused on the keyword options, hence trying all access modes etc. 

It turns out that its more a flushing/releasing issue, perhaps in
combination with the Jupyter Notebook (holding a reference to the object?).
If i display the returned dataset, Jupyter displays the string 'repr'. I do
this all the time with GDAL datasets just to confirm i actually have a
dataset, whereas a failed command would result in "None". 

But somehow, in this case, closing the dataset with "ds = None" fails to
release the file handle (and doesnt flush?), but only when let Jupyter
display the dataset (repr).  If i close the dataset right away, it works as
expected. 

Here is a notebook showing what i did:
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/RutgerK/7da186e23b3ec20526c9a1c16c5cf98a

Is the method which doesn't work something that should work, or is it simply
bad practice? I'm pretty sure i do this with the raster utilities all the
time, without any problems.

Rutger

Hi,

Let's say that I have these raster maps with 2048 m and 1024 m pixel sizes
http://kartat.kapsi.fi/files/taustakarttasarja_jhs180/taustakartta_8m/2048m/etrs89/png/Taustakartta_8milj.png

http://kartat.kapsi.fi/files/taustakarttasarja_jhs180/taustakartta_4m/1024m/etrs89/png/Taustakartta_4milj.pgw

Converting the 8milj.png into GeoPackage raster table is easy

gdal_translate -of gpkg -a_srs epsg:3067 Taustakartta_8milj.png overview.gpkg

Image goes to zoom level 2 as reported by gdalinfo:
Metadata:
  IDENTIFIER=overview
  ZOOM_LEVEL=2

But now the hard part: I would like to append the second image 4milj.png to the same layer "overview" as ZOOM_LEVEL=3 because that  map is designed for that resolution. Is it possible to do that by using some parameters of the driver http://www.gdal.org/drv_geopackage_raster.html or with some clever trick?

The following works:

gdal_translate Taustakartta_4milj.png test.gpkg -of gpkg  -a_srs epsg:3067 -expand rgba
gdal_translate Taustakartta_8milj.png Taustakartta_8milj_rgba.tif -expand rgba
gdalwarp Taustakartta_8milj_rgba.tif test.gpkg -doo ZOOM_LEVEL=2

Expension to RGBA wouldn't be strictly needed in theory since your 2 rasters have the same palette,
but in practice you have to do it.

Oh yeah, naturally by polishing with gdalwarp and -doo. I would almost say
"supernaturally". Thanks, I will remember this, and if I won't I can find it
by searching "me+asking+something+tricky".

Hello,
I am converting an .osm file to shapefile, and there is one thing that I do not understand:

What is the difference between: osm_id and osm_way_id fields (keys)?

They are defined in osmconf.ini file, but only for [multipolygons].
Here is an explanation from the osmconf.ini file:

# note: for multipolygons, osm_id=yes instanciates a osm_id field for the id of relations
# and a osm_way_id field for the id of closed ways. Both fields are exclusively set.
Does that mean that osm_way_id will be used to represent the osm id number of a closed way, while osm_id will only be used for to represent the osm id number of relations?

It's a bit confusing concept.

What makes the closed ways so special so that they need to have their own special field (osm_way_id)?
Why wasn't there a separate field for relations instead: like: osm_relation_id, while closed ways would use the osm_id.

Thank you for the reply.

Indeed, OSM data model is a bit confusing concept. You can read about it
from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements. Simple, small polygons
are usually modeled as a one continuous, closed ring. That makes one "way"
and the ID for it is found from way_id. All the other polygons are modeled
as relations which are collections of ways and they have "relation_id" in
the data as you can see

node_id http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/node/389960161
way_id  http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/way/34028339
relation_id http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/125519

IDs are unique only for nodes/ways/relations but not across the elements. I
do not think that renaming osm_id into relation_id (and probably osm_id of
points into node_id, or?) and osm_way_id into way_id to follow the native
model would make things very much more clear.

Hi Jukka,

I was only questioning why can't "osm_way_id" be renamed to "osm_relation_id". The "osm_id" would remain the same.
Of course I am not a developer, I was just thinking out loud, and hopping that somebody might explain to me, why is there the "osm_way_id" key.
I could totally be wrong.

All three examples you've sent me:

http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/node/389960161
http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/way/34028339 http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/125519

Show the id of three different elements: An id of a node, of a way, and of a relation.

What makes it confusing (at least to me) is why did developers of the GDAL OSM driver decided to use a separate key(field) to depict the closed ways?

I understand that and ESRI shapefile can not differentiate between a closed way and a relation (for example: a relation consisted of two closed ways). So they had to "group" both closed ways and relation into a single shapefile geometry type (multi)polygons/polylines. But still, if they wanted to differentiate between these two elements, it's more logical (at least to me) that a relation should have gotten a separate key(field), instead of a close way. A relation is higher in the hierarchy of OSM elements, and can contain different elements (a node and a way, three ways, fours nodes...).

I am just thinking out loud, nothing more.I can definitively be wrong, and I am eager to learn more about the OSM in general.

Hi,

ogr2ogr creates these ids:


-          for point data node_id becomes âosm_idâ

-          for linestrings way_id becomes âosm_idâ

-          for multilinestrings relation_id becomes âosm_idâ

-          for other relations relation_id becomes âosm_idâ

-          for polygons which come from relations relation_id becomes âosm_idâ and osm_way_id is null

-          for polygons which come from ways the way_id becomes osm_way_id and osm_id is null

GDAL cannot write ids of the way polygons and relation polygons into the same ID field because there would be duplicate ids (same numbers coming from way_id and relation_id).

Historically GDAL wrote way polygons into layer named âpolygonsâ and relation polygons into âmultipolygonsâ and both had just âosm_idâ. It was perhaps more clear when it comes to ids but more fuzzy for users to find polygons from two different tables. Remember that in the OSM model a way polygon must be converted into relation polygon if user wants to make a hole into the polygon.

If I understand right you consider that instead of having now in the multipolygon layer relation_id as osm_id and way_id as osm_way_id it would be better to have way_id as osm_id and relation_id as osm_relation_id.  Perhaps yes, but for my mind the difference is not huge.

I guess that when the developer of the OSM driver stopped using the âpolygonsâ layer they made the driver to write also the way polygons into the existing âmultipolygonsâ layer. That layer already had osm_id so a new field osm_way_id was simply added into that layer.

If you can prove that there are some general use cases where renaming the id fields of the multipolygons layer would be a big improvement, please file a feature request.

I understand that and ESRI shapefile can not differentiate between a closed way and a relation (for example: a relation consisted of two closed ways). So they had to "group" both closed ways and relation into a single shapefile geometry type (multi)polygons/polylines. But still, if they wanted to differentiate between these two elements, it's more logical (at least to me) that a relation should have gotten a separate key(field), instead of a close way. A relation is higher in the hierarchy of OSM elements, and can contain different elements (a node and a way, three ways, fours nodes...).

I am just thinking out loud, nothing more.
I can definitively be wrong, and I am eager to learn more about the OSM in general.

Indeed, OSM data model is a bit confusing concept. You can read about it
from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Elements. Simple, small polygons
are usually modeled as a one continuous, closed ring. That makes one "way"
and the ID for it is found from way_id. All the other polygons are modeled
as relations which are collections of ways and they have "relation_id" in
the data as you can see

node_id http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/node/389960161
way_id  http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/way/34028339

relation_id
http://www.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/relation/125519

IDs are unique only for nodes/ways/relations but not across the elements. I
do not think that renaming osm_id into relation_id (and probably osm_id of
points into node_id, or?) and osm_way_id into way_id to follow the native
model would make things very much more clear.

Hi Jukka,

Thank you again for the explanation and information about GDAL history!!


> If I understand right you consider that instead of having now in the multipolygon layer relation_id as osm_id and way_id as osm_way_id it would be better to have way_id as osm_id and relation_id as osm_relation_id.Â  Perhaps yes, but for my mind the difference is not huge. 
Yes.


> I guess that when the developer of the OSM driver stopped using the âpolygonsâ layer they made the driver to write also the way polygons into the existing âmultipolygonsâ layer. That layer already had osm_id so a new field osm_way_id was simply added into that layer.
That perfectly explains my question!!


> If you can prove that there are some general use cases where renaming the id fields of the multipolygons layer would be a big improvement, please file a feature request.

I do not have any big or moderate improvement in mind. Your explanation on OSM driver history cleared why is that so.


Thank you once again Jukka.
I owe you at least a beer for the help you provided for the last couple of weeks!

OK, I managed to reproduce with your above elements. I've pushed a fix so that in that case 
the WGS84BoundingBox is just ignored and the most precise tile matrix used.

Subject: [gdal-dev] GRIB file error: Ran out of file reading SECT0
Message-ID: <CABeE34v58_YfvP=qCnDoPbJp-L3mSUP=LOcAFXh=BUKLdFytVA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,
For the first time I am working with GRIB files and have stumbled across a
problem having GDAL open files. The data source is the Copernicus
Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS <https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/>).
QGIS, ArcGIS and GRIB viewers have no problem opening the file for view,
yet GDAL returns this error using multiple functions, including gdalinfo:

Warning: Inside GRIB2Inventory, Message # 26
ERROR: Ran out of file reading SECT0
There were 72 trailing bytes in the file.

Depending on the file, the reported trailing bytes varies. I should also
mention that no spatial reference system is defined, though my assumption
is that it is WGS 84, based on the data. If I just wanted to view the data,
I would  use any of the aforementioned software to do so, but I would like
to archive selected GRIB datasets in a postGIS database if possible.

Does anyone know the source of this error message? Has anyone found a work
around? I would attach a sample GRIB file, but am not sure as to the
protocol for attachments on this listserv.

kind regards,
Hannah Augustin

QGIS uses GDAL to read GRIB files.

This warning/error doesn't prevent GDAL from opening the file since gdalinfo reports a 
dataset. Does gdal_translate to a GeoTIFF work ? Presumably yes, otherwise QGIS wouldn't 
have displayed the dataset. Then just ignore the warning.

I'm not sure if it is an issue in the degrib library used by GDAL or if the datasets have some 
form of non conformance and degrib is picky about it.

In the below report, there is a SRS reported. Geographic based on a sphere of radius = 
6367470 m. Given the rather low resolution of this dataset, considering this is WGS84 or 
any other datum based on Greenwich is OK

Was a .c file. I've replaced the gotos with exception throwing.

Hello,

When converting an .osm file to .shp files with ogr2ogr.exe, one needs to define a list of required fields (keys) in gdal-data\osmconf.ini file, for each geometry type (points, lines, multipolygons, multilinestrings).Like so (labelled in red color):
[points]#common attributesosm_id=yesosm_version=noosm_timestamp=noosm_uid=noosm_user=noosm_changeset=noÂ #keys to report as OGR fieldsattributes=name,barrier,highway,ref,address,is_in,place,man_made
Why is that so? Why do field names need to be predefined before their extraction from the .osm file?

Why can't only those fields which already exist in the .osm file, be extracted?


Thank you for the reply.

Kind regards,
Djordje Spasic

How could ogr2ogr possibly know what fields are in the file? It would require 
a full parse of the file, and likely give you many more fields than you 
possibly want in any case.

Especially with shapefiles it is also practically impossible with any bigger
datasets.  Dbf file can have only 255 fields, or 254 if fields may contain
NULL values https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/3kfd3hw9(v=vs.80).aspx.
There are 1012 different tags in the Irish OSM data today
http://taginfo.openstreetmap.ie/tags. It means that there are 758 more tags
than it is possible to save as fields into shapefiles.

Hi,

I've just added  in GDAL trunk TILEMATRIX / ZOOM_LEVEL open options and the 
corresponding <TileMatrix> / <ZoomLevel> elements as child of <GDAL_WMTS>

Examples:

gdalinfo WMTSCapabilities_arcgis_usgs.xml -oo tilematrix=14
gdalinfo WMTSCapabilities_arcgis_usgs.xml,tilematrix=14
gdalinfo WMTSCapabilities_arcgis_usgs.xml -oo zoom_level=14 
gdalinfo WMTSCapabilities_arcgis_usgs.xml,zoom_level=14 


<GDAL_WMTS>
  <GetCapabilitiesUrl>/vsimem/nominal.xml</GetCapabilitiesUrl>
  <Layer>lyr1</Layer>
  <Style>style=auto</Style>
  <TileMatrixSet>tms</TileMatrixSet>
  <TileMatrix>tm_0</TileMatrix>
  <!-- or --> <ZoomLevel>0</ZoomLevel>
  <DataWindow>
    <UpperLeftX>-20037508.3428</UpperLeftX>
    <UpperLeftY>20037508.3428</UpperLeftY>
    <LowerRightX>20037508.34278254</LowerRightX>
    <LowerRightY>-20037508.34278254</LowerRightY>
  </DataWindow>
  <BandsCount>4</BandsCount>
  <Cache />
  <UnsafeSSL>true</UnsafeSSL>
  <ZeroBlockHttpCodes>204,404</ZeroBlockHttpCodes>
  <ZeroBlockOnServerException>true</ZeroBlockOnServerException>
</GDAL_WMTS>


The difference between TILEMATRIX and ZOOM_LEVEL is that the first is the value of the 
<ows:Identifier> of the <TileMatrix> in the WMTS GetCapabilities response, while the later is 
the index (starting with 0) of the <TileMatrix> to consider. Sometimes they are the same 
value (but sometimes the TileMatrix identifier is like EPSG:XXXX:zoom_level)

Message-ID: <1808570345.6361644.1480899703991@mail.yahoo.com>

I am using GDAL's ogr2ogr.exe to convert an .osm file to .shp files.

I noticed one thing I do not understand: OSM driver sometimes saves closed ways into both the multipolygons.shp and lines.shp files.
Why is that so?

Why are closed ways (like building footprints) sent to the lines.shp file? Shouldn't all of closed ways representing building footprints be saved to the multipolygons.shp file? Why are they sometimes saved into the lines.shp file as well?

I would be grateful for any kind of reply.

Thank you in advance.

In OSM it is a bit fuzzy what closed linestrings mean. Partly it is based on
known and agreed semantics which may be documented in
wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features. So a closed linestring is a
polygon if is has any building tag, but a closed linestring
"junction=roundabout" is a closed linestring. One can try to make a list
about which closed linestrings are always polygons by sorting the wiki page,
or then you can rely on the previous work. The default rendering style file
has such a list
https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/blob/master/default.style and you
can find it also from the osmconf.ini file



However, users can use the override tag "area=yes/no" for changing the
interpretation. A way with tags highway=service, area=yes means polygon.
Also, as you can read from http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:area, a
way can have one tag that makes it into polygon and another tag that means a
closed linestring at the same time.

For analyzing why you have now some way in both multipolygons and lines
tables you must take the osm_id from the lines or osm_way_id from the
multipolygons and check the data from the native OSM data. I can't show such
example right ahead but you will find examples from your own data. Take the
id and make a query like this



Check all the tags of the feature. If you still do not find a reason why it
goes into both polygon and linestring tables you can mail us the link.
However, the OSM data model differs so much from the traditional GIS model
with simple features and fixed schema that conversion from OSM to GIS tends
to be lossy.

Thank you Jukka!

I wasn't precise enough: particular closed way is not sent to both multipolygons.shp and lines.shp. It is sent to the lines.shp, and I am wondering why hasn't it been sent to the multipolygons.shp.

But your detailed explanation helped me realize that this building footprint does not have the "building" key, only "building:levels". And as "building:levels" is not included in osmconf.ini file's line:
closed_ways_are_polygons=

it seems that this is why OSM driver sent it to the lines.shp.


I will definitively read through the links you gave me Jukka. Thank you.

Until then, do you mind if I ask just for a tiny clarification?

Is this the part of that file that I need to take a look at:
https://github.com/openstreetmap/osm2pgsql/blob/master/default.style#L83-L152


> and you can find it also from the osmconf.ini file

But osmconf.ini file only defines the polygons keys, not linear ones?
This is the line in osmconf.ini which defines polygon keys:

closed_ways_are_polygons=
?

This is the line in osmconf.ini which defines polygon keys:
closed_ways_are_polygons=


Those closed ways which are not defined to be polygons are considered to be linear rings and they go to the lines layer.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Call for discussion on RFC 64: Triangle,
	Polyhedral surface and TIN
Message-ID: <2629554.pVscNPs2f5@even-i700>

Hi,

This is a call to discuss the proposed RFC 64: Triangle, Polyhedral surface and TIN

    https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc64_triangle_polyhedralsurface_tin

~~~~~

Summary:

As of now, the OGRGeometry class (the base class from which all the subtypes are derived) is 
limited to OGRCompoundCurve, OGRCircularString, OGRLinearRing, OGRMultiLineString, 
OGRMultiPoint, OGRMultiPolygon, OGRMultiCurve, OGRSimpleCurve, OGRCurvePolygon and 
OGRPolygon.

This RFC addresses the addition of the following new geometries in OGRGeometry:
* Triangle - A subset of polygons, the fundamental difference is that it is made of 3 nodes 
only (actually 4, with the last one being the repetition of the first one) and ONLY ONE 
exterior boundary and NO interior polygons.
* PolyhedralSurface - A 3D figure made exclusively of Polygons.
* TriangulatedSurface - A subset of PolyhedralSurface; a 3D figure which consists exclusively 
of Triangles. 

~~~~~

I've rebased and extended the work done by Avyav during last GSoc on top of current trunk, 
where it passes our continuous integration tests. I think we should consider  merging it soon 
as it can easily rot if kept longer in a branch (the refresh from my previous branch dating to 
end of August was rather painful)

Thanks Even,

Does a TriangulatedSurface consist of separate Triangles, all with each
three vertices stored explicitly? I.e. is there no shared vertex pool that
primitives use via index?

That seems to be what simple features dictates, but it's unclear to me how
applications should work with it. Is vertex de-duplication to be be done at
each conversion, or is there a way to carry those indexes through?

Cheers, Mike

This is a very welcome change, allowing us to drop a bunch of patches
from the Debian package.

I've forwarded the remaining patches to Bugzilla.

Yes, the TriangulatedSurface is a collection of separate triangles. No smart optimization here. 
We stick to the simple features model.

Apart from shapefile/filegdb triangle strip/fan that could be considered as a kind of vertex 
indexing, the WKT/WKB representation (and thus the exchanges with PostGIS) don't have 
that.

Actually you could retrieve an indexed view of the TIN by using the 
GDALTriangulationCreateDelaunay() API
( http://www.gdal.org/gdal__alg_8h.html#a498205ae5f4f0ec9f43e5c65bb392060 ), although 
it is a bit overkill to recompute a triangulation from a set of triangles... (and the triangulation 
it will return will generally not be the original one)

I am wondering this part:
 
"GEOS methods are still used in some cases, but with the following
limitations - a Triangle is converted to a Polygon with one exterior ring;
Polyhedral Surfaces and Triangulated Surfaces are converted to
MultiPolygons?. (each Triangle in a Triangulated Surface is converted to a
Polygon as described previously)"

Does it mean presenting a TIN with two triangles as something like



As far as I know such multipolygon is not valid accorfing to the Simple
feature specification where "boundaries and may touch at only a finite
number of Points". Valid presentation would probably be to wrap polygons
into GeometryCollection. Is GEOS used in a relaxed way so that shared parts
of boundaries in MultiPolygons do not throw an error?

Thanks Even, I was thinking of preserving an indexed mesh, with (for
example) a constrained triangulation. Simple features will ingest this, but
once it comes back out vertex de-duplication would be enough to restore the
indexing. You'd need some record of vertex identity after they are expanded
out on each triangle, but there's no internal way to ID them in simple fs
(except maybe by using M).

I feel that simple features is not particularly useful in this regard,
though fine as a one-way output from triangulation sources. I think
TopoJSON is similar, in that all vertices are explict, there's no index
-but because they are all integer-scaled in the context of the graph,
there's no numerical difficulties with uniqueness.  Interested to hear
other views, though appreciate that this is pretty off-topic.

Cheers, Mike.

Yes that's indeed a limitation. A function to do the de-duplication and get an indexed 
triangulation could be added later. We don't strictly need to store the ID (unless preserving 
the actual value of the ID is needed ? if so, yes using M could be a workaround). The 
deduplication can be done later by building a map from point coordinates to an integer index 
while iterating over the geometries. The performance should be O(N*log(N)) where N is the 
total number of vertices.
This RFC paves the ground for later functionalities, and in its current state, should already be 
useful for exchanges between formats like PostGIS / GML / Shapefile.

Actually TopoJSON is a bit of mixed topological format. Lines and polygons can use shared 
arcs, but the vertices themselves are repeated among arcs that share the same vertices, so 
you could have inconsistencies and checking for them is not immediate. See

That's a very good remark. Indeed for GEOS purposes, a MultiPolygon with Polygons that 
have shared boundaries is invalid. I've changed that to a GeometryCollection. But anyway, TIN 
& PoyhedralSurface in GEOS world are degraded cases where behaviour will always be 
suboptimal.

Thanks for the feedback.

That's a very good remark. Indeed for GEOS purposes, a MultiPolygon with Polygons that have shared boundaries is invalid. I've changed that to a GeometryCollection. But anyway, TIN & PoyhedralSurface in GEOS world are degraded cases where behaviour will always be suboptimal.



Thanks for the feedback.

Hi all,

I work with gdal-2.1.0 on CentOS

I would like to compil with ECW 5.2.1 so i add in the configure :

--with-ecw=/usr/local/hexagon


but i get the following message when compiling :


libgdal.so : undefined reference to 'NCS::CView::SetTransformList (...)

libgdal.so : undefined reference to 'NCS::CString::Utf8Decode(...)

libgdal.so : undefined reference to 'NCS::CString::utf8_str(...)



Did i miss something?


Thanks a lot.


Regards,

Vincent

Hi Vincent,

You might also review the BuildHints wiki page, that we all try to keep 
uptodate, for ECW at https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ECW  And if you 
notice something missing (like a tip for CentOS users) please definitely 
edit that wiki page and add it.  Hopefully this helps a little. Thanks!

There are lots of things about ecw 2.3.3 which is compiling for me.

But not the 5.2.1 with gcc 5.1.0
it's about link... 
In the 2.3.3 i had :
- libNCSEcwC.so    
- libNCSEcwC.so    
- libNCSEcwC.so

my problem is about link...

In the 2.3.3 i had :
- libNCSEcwC.so
- libNCSEcw.so
- libNCSCnet.so
- libNCSCUtil.so

but in ECW 5.2.1, i only got :
- libNCSEcw.so
- libNCSEcwJNI.so

Is it enough to build it with gdal?

Thanks

Vincent

The issue is actually documented in https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ECW:

"""
Binary ECW SDK and GCC >= 5.2
Since GCC 5.2, GCC uses by default a new C++ ABI for libstdc++, which is incompatible of the 
ECW SDK binaries (at least to this date). The workaround is to build GDAL with CXXFLAGS="-
D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" ./configure [options] 
Note: this trick will not work if you link against other C++ libraries compiler with the new ABI 
(such as likbml, podofo, poppler, cryptopp, etc.. typically coming from your distrution). If you 
also need them, you'll have to recompile them from source with CXXFLAGS="-
D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" 
"""
Even the latest ECW SDK 5.3 uses the old ABI. You'll have to wait that the vendor releases a 
new build with the new C++ ABI for a less awkward solution.

Downgrading jasper to 1.900.5 results in a successful build.

Looking in the jasper of my ubuntu 16.04 (1.900.1-debian1-2.4ubuntu1), I can see:

/usr/include/jasper/jas_config2.h:#define	uchar		unsigned char
/usr/include/jasper/jas_config.h:#define uchar unsigned char
/usr/include/jasper/jas_icc.h:	uchar *ucdata; /* Unicode localizable description */
/usr/include/jasper/jas_icc.h:	uchar macdata[69]; /* Localizable Macintosh description 
*/
/usr/include/jasper/jas_icc.h:extern uchar jas_iccprofdata_srgb[];
/usr/include/jasper/jas_icc.h:extern uchar jas_iccprofdata_sgray[];
/usr/include/jasper/jas_icc.h:jas_iccprof_t *jas_iccprof_createfrombuf(uchar *buf, int len);
/usr/include/jasper/jas_stream.h:	uchar *bufbase_;
/usr/include/jasper/jas_stream.h:	uchar *bufstart_;
/usr/include/jasper/jas_stream.h:	uchar *ptr_;
/usr/include/jasper/jas_stream.h:	uchar tinybuf_[JAS_STREAM_MAXPUTBACK + 1];
/usr/include/jasper/jas_stream.h:	uchar *buf_;
/usr/include/jasper/jas_stream.h:	  jas_stream_flushbuf((stream), (uchar)(c)) : \
/usr/include/jasper/jas_types.h:#if !defined(uchar)
/usr/include/jasper/jas_types.h:#define uchar unsigned char

jasper.h is included by GDAL, which includes in turn jas_config.h and jas_types.h, which both 
provide the #define	uchar		unsigned char

So probably your newer jasper.h has no longer those includes, or something has changed in 
one of the above files.

You could as well replace the JAS_CAST(uchar *, buf); by JAS_CAST(unsigned char*, buf)

Thanks Even, that's helpful.

Whereabouts would I try to make this patch? Not sure what file to look 
for to do this. Sorry!

I have a quick question:  does anyone know if anyone has attempted to build GDAL using MSBuild.  I am planning on writing an MSBuild script for GDAL so it can more easily be built in Jenkins.

Thanks,

Nigel

Nigel,

Try make_gdal.bat, https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/MakeFileProjects

Then, feed MSBuild with .vcxproj file.

The issue is actually documented in https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ECW:



"""

Binary ECW SDK and GCC >= 5.2

Since GCC 5.2, GCC uses by default a new C++ ABI for libstdc++, which is incompatible of the ECW SDK binaries (at least to this date). The workaround is to build GDAL with CXXFLAGS="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0" ./configure [options]

Note: this trick will not work if you link against other C++ libraries compiler with the new ABI (such as likbml, podofo, poppler, cryptopp, etc.. typically coming from your distrution). If you also need them, you'll have to recompile them from source with CXXFLAGS="-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0"

"""

Even the latest ECW SDK 5.3 uses the old ABI. You'll have to wait that the vendor releases a new build with the new C++ ABI for a less awkward solution.

Ah you're right. Looking at
https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc%2B%2B/manual/using_dual_abi.html , it seems the 
version with the new ABI was indeed 5.1. I've fixed the wiki.

Hey,

I want to build java binding for GDAL.
After following "Build Instructions for GDAL/OGR In Java (Windows)", I get
the next error:
*"NMAKE : fatal error U1045: spawn failed : Permission denied"*

Subject: [gdal-dev] Primary keys are ignored in ogr2ogr when converting from
	Sqlite databases
Message-ID: <CA+RzLkbxAP+TaHeFmasTW85OSB5iwpCuN8PWLP4VZnka3JivCg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, I am using ogr2ogr to export data from Spatialite to other formats
(such as PostGIS or a new Spatialite db).

The layers have an integer primary key, but this field is ignored in
the output table, as an OGC_FID field is created which uses
consecutive numbers, ignoring the real values of the primary key in
the original field.

This is quite inconvenient, as the layer is quite useless after loosing the PK.

I'll provide one example to make it clearer.

- Input data:

CREATE TABLE test
(id INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL);
SELECT AddGeometryColumn('test', 'the_geom', 4326, 'POINT', 'XY');

INSERT INTO 'test' (id, name, the_geom) VALUES (1, "row1",
GeomFromText('POINT(1.01 2.02)', 4326));
INSERT INTO 'test' (id, name, the_geom) VALUES (3, "row3",
GeomFromText('POINT(3.03 4.04)', 4326));

Now we export the table using ogr2ogr:
ogr2ogr -f "SQLite" db2.sqlite  db.sqlite test -dsco SPATIALITE=YES

Now compare both layers:
$ ogrinfo -q db.sqlite test

Layer name: test
OGRFeature(test):1
  name (String) = row1
  POINT (1.01 2.02)

OGRFeature(test):3
  name (String) = row3
  POINT (3.03 4.04)

$ ogrinfo -q db2.sqlite test

Layer name: test
OGRFeature(test):1
  name (String) = row1
  POINT (1.01 2.02)

OGRFeature(test):2
  name (String) = row3
  POINT (3.03 4.04)

Is this a bug or is an intended behaviour? Is there any way to workaround it?
I am using GDAL version 1.11.3. It also happens when exporting to a
different format such as PostGIS.

Greetings,

CÃ©sar Martinez

Have you tried to use the *-preserve_fid *qualifier*??

A workaround is to pick the primary key as a normal attribute and let GDAL
to create its own primary key. You can add a unique constraint to ID
afterwards https://www.techonthenet.com/sqlite/unique.php and then it is
almost like a PK for you



Easier way for preventing duplicate values would be to create an unique
index on ID.

Hi,

There have been some good remarks, one regarding integration with GEOS that I've 
taken into account in the implementation, another one regarding the possibility to 
get indexed TIN that I think can be later added if needed.

So I move to adopt RFC 64: Triangle, Polyhedral surface and TIN

Message-ID: <CA+Ei1OdQA7Vur-D6Ma6CfJnShctdn59Xf=qkfTSZ_j4968MdHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am interested how FileGDB subtypes work in GDAL (GDAL should support
them since version 2.0). I have feature class `Silnice` (roads) with
attribute `typ` (type). This attribute is connected with subtype
road_type (1 - highway, 2 - speed road, 3 - ...). ogrinfo detects this
attribute as an integer, eg.

$ ogrinfo Repository/ArcCR500/ArcCR500_v32.gdb Silnice -fid 36843
Had to open data source read-only.
INFO: Open of `Repository/ArcCR500/ArcCR500_v32.gdb'
      using driver `OpenFileGDB' successful.
...
OGRFeature(Silnice):36843
  TRIDA (Integer) = 1
  CISLO_SILNICE (String) = 185
  ...

Is it possible to change this behaviour in the sense of preferring
subtype description, something like:

OGRFeature(Silnice):36843
  TRIDA (String) = 'highway'
  CISLO_SILNICE (String) = 185
  ...

or

OGRFeature(Silnice):36843
  TRIDA (Integer) = 1
  TRIDA_DESC (String) = 'highway'
  CISLO_SILNICE (String) = 185
  ...

?

Is there any difference between OpenFileGDB and FileGDB drivers?

Thanks! Martin

How sub-type works is explained in
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc50_ogr_field_subtype

What you want here is probably related to "expanding" "coded value domains". There is a 
ticket about that:
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/5741

This isn't implemented yet.

Hi all,

Will there be an update of the Sentinel driver that is able to deal with the
new Level 1C product format (as announced here:
https://scihub.copernicus.eu/news/News00124 ) ?

Thanks,

Johan

Hi,

I started working on it here :

https://github.com/jmichel-otb/gdal/tree/sentinel2-new-format-support

But :
- The more I work on it, the more it looks like a bunch of ugly patches,
- I managed to get datasets reporting right, but the reading still fails.

I do not have much time to move it forward at the moment. I would also 
propably need help on the reading part ...

Regards,

Julien

Subject: [gdal-dev] Convert precipitation accumulations from HDF5 to GeoTiff
Message-ID: <CAHNf2YQcQ5k+2c9HzWKLN+ampBEHUMC9oLiUcexRBmwM1-HT+Q@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to use the precipitation accumulations from our national weather
agency: https://data.knmi.nl/datasets/radar_tar_corr_accum_03h/2.0
The data is in HDF5 with two subsets.
I only need one subset and I need the data in WGS84.

I'm using GDAL v2.2 from GisInternals.com
I tried using GDALWarp but then I get an error about missing the
transformation matrix.
Using Google I figured out I need to do GDALTranslate first to set the
georeferenced bounds.

This is the result of GDALInfo:

"test-translate.tif"


This is my GDALWarp command:

gdalwarp -overwrite -s_srs "+proj=stere +lat_0=90 +lon_0=0 +lat_ts=60
+a=6378.14 +b=6356.75 +x_0=0 y_0=0" -t_srs EPSG:3857 -dstnodata 65535
-of GTiff "test-translate.tif" "test-warp.tif"


The warped tif is not where I expect it to be.
I expect a origin around 52 en 5 degrees (The Netherlands)
I'm getting: Origin = (169.559973821725920,89.530840368222059)

I've checked with the data provider and the projectionstring is correct.
What am I doing wrong?

Thanks,

Hey Paul,

If you assign the RD projection with 'a_srs', you should also assign the
'ullr' coordinates in that same projection, not in lat/lon degrees like you
do now.

Rutger

Thanks Rutger,

You are completely right. I assumed the coordinates were in the same
projection as the project string.

Menno van Scheers replied me directly and suggested I should use 0.0,
-3650.000, 800.000, -4415.000 as ullr coordinates.
I tried it and now the GeoTiff is where I expect it to be.

Hey,

Based on the metadata from the file you posted i would guess the
x-coordinate of the right edge (lrx) should be about ~700km or ~700000m.

The column offset is 0, and there are 700 columns in the file which are
slightly over 1km. How would you end up with 800?

You can calculate the other corner coordinates in a similar fashion. 


Regards,
Rutger

Thanks again Rutger for your observation.

The bounding box was sent to me and I was already very happy the tiff is
located in The Netherlands ;)

I did a closer look at the meta data and with your explanation I come up
with this 'formula':

The ul is 0.0, -1 * geographic_geo_row_offset
lr is geographic_geo_number_columns, -1 * (geographic_geo_number_rows +
geographic_geo_row_offset)
Resulting in 0.0 3650 700, -4415

Thanks,

Paul

Hey,

Yes, that looks good. Although instead of using the -1, i think its meant to
be the actual y-resolution as provided in the metadata, but i'm never 100%
sure on those things. Its tempting to ignore it in this case, since its so
close to 1, but imagine what will happen if they increase the resolution
after an upgrade. If you read the number of rows from the data, and use a
hard coded resolution, the geographical extent would change instead of the
resolution.
/
# geographic_geo_pixel_size_x
yres = -1.0000052 # km
xres = 1.0000013

# geographic_geo_column_offset
xoffset = 0
yoffset = 3649.9802

# geographic_geo_number_columns
ncol = 700
nrow = 765

ulx = xoffset * xres
uly = yoffset * yres
lrx = ulx + ncol * xres
lry = uly + nrow * yres
/
Which gives: 
(0.0, -3649.9991798970395, 700.0009100000001, -4415.003157897039)

You can also calculate them by transforming the given lat/lon corner
coordinates to the proj4 projection string given in the metadata. If i do
that as well, i get:
(0.0, -3649.9991119177544, 700.000903671186, -4415.003881997636)

Since both should be similar (there could be some rounding in the provided
corner coordinates), its a good way to check if you did it right.

The last thing to think about it what the coordinates are refering to, the
outer edge of the corner pixel, or the center of the corner pixel. Given
"geographic_geo_pixel_def=LU" in the metadata, i would guess it the actual
outer edge (which is GDAL-style as well).

Here is a Jupyter Notebook which i used (but nbviewer is down right now,
check it later):
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/RutgerK/70fe9d76d72b0fbfdeebda0568753828

And i have to apologize to Even for not using OSR's coordinate conversion in
that example. ;)

Rutger

Sorry, what i said makes no sense at all. You shouldn't multiply the offset
with the y-resolution, although you should take the sign, like you did. Its
a bit strange that they provide the offset as a positive value.

Hi Jukka,

Thanks for the report. Should now be fixed per r36849. This was introduced on Nov 24th. 
Crazy that the hundreds of existing tests didn't catch that, so I added a new one :-)

Message-ID: <CACJ51z3aMH82uCiBGXEX+nnPuM=Hs7MLU2vtpoAgMfGzBihzqA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm passing a WKT CRS into GTIFSetFromOGISDefn().  The WKT is valid in that
it conforms to the OGC representation v1.0 (12-063-r5).  The function
mentioned above parses the WKT into nodes properly, but the code that tries
to interpret the actual WKT can't deal with the new specification.
However, it doesn't error.  Instead, it sets a bunch of value to be
"user-defined" and results in Geotiff keys that don't map to the input CRS.

Is there a reason that a "bad" CRS is mapped as a user-defined value rather
than returning an error?  Is there a plan to update WKT code to handle the
new specification?

Thanks,

GDAL doesn't handle WKT 2 yet (the parsing of the WKT as a OGRSpatialReference object 
happens to work as both WKT 1 and 2 are serialized in similar way), so the current behaviour 
is not surprising. GTIFSetFromOGISDefn() should indeed probably error out if it identifies the 
WKT as WKT v2. Note that we don't want to reject all WKT that we don't recognize entirely, 
since the code can for example handle a WKT (v1) with a projection method it doesn't 
recognize as a ESRI WKT PE string.

> Is there a plan to update WKT code to handle the

Nobody is working on it as far as I know (it has been proposed as a potential subject in past 
GSoC programs), but that would be indeed neat to consider it. The big question is : how ? One 
of the possibilities would be to map WKT v2 as WKT v1 on ingestion, so that only affects a 
single part of the code. Another possibility would be to accept both in all places where GDAL 
handles WKT / OGRSpatialRefrence, but that means updating all drivers that map WKT to 
their own internal representation. None of them are really satisfactory. Or a third one would 
be to make WKT 2 the internal representation and WKT 1 just on import/export borders, but 
that also requires updating various drivers, and there would be some loss of information as 
WKT 1 has for example the TOWGS84 node that doesn't exist in WKT 2.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Question on 0th IFD offset when producing a
 JPEG-Compressed GeoTIFF (GDAL 1.11 vs 2.x)
Message-ID: <CAJaHrDwPP5_1_+oTAi2u=reSYRbjWhb2cKyREXFe0sLfB3XUVQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi List,
I'm investigating on some GeoTIFF data being produced with GDAL 1.11.3.
Basically, when setting COMPRESS=JPEG, the generated GTIFF has the 0th IFD
offset set to some KB.

these are the first 16 bytes of a GeoTIFF being generated like that:
49 49 2A 00 88 44 00 00 *10* 00 00 01 03 00 01

so:
49 49 is the endianness
00 2A is the magic number
00 00 44 88 is the offset of the 0th IFD = (17544 bytes)
Then there are several TAGs (baseline, extended and so on).
However, I think that any TIFF reader will jump to the 00 00 44 88 offset.
Moreover, the offset 00 00 00 08 (referring to the red bolded byte in my
previous sample) seems not referred by any other referencing IFD.

So it seems like that GeoTIFF has some useless bytes right after the first
8s.

I have then tried to use GDAL 2.2.1 and GDAL 2.1.0 and with that version I
see that the GeoTIFF being produced using same exact command is smaller and
the 0th IFD offset is 8 with these recent versions.
(This information is confirmed by AsTIFFTagViewer and TiffInfo too).

When activating CPL_DEBUG on all versions I see this output on GDAL
1.11.3/1.11.4 whilst I don't see it on GDAL 2.x

*GTiff: directory moved during flush in FlushDirectory()*

I have quickly checked some reference in the issue tracker but I was unable
to find anything, especially due to the fact that when searching for "IFD"
it returns hundreds of results related to "IFDefined" :-)

Do you have any feedback or comment on this?
Is it related to any bug in old code or some version update? (is a
different libtiff version somehow involved?)

Please, let me know.
Best Regards,
Daniele

Hi all,


I got some products which have a wrong band ordering in raster but the good one in metadata.

In my c++ application, what are the gdal functions to call  to set the new band ordering ?

Is it possible?


Thanks.

Yes this is an enhancement I did during 2.0 cycle.

I think it is linked to this NEWS item (although it is clearly not obvious), which brings other 
space enhancements:
 * for JPEG-compressed TIFF, avoid quantization tables to be emitted in each strip/tile and 
use optimized Huffman coding by default

Previously we indeed lost space since the IFD was written twice. The handling of JPEG 
quantization tables in libtiff is quite tricky, since they are emitted only when the first pixel is 
encoded, but at that time, you have already had to write a first version of the IFD without the 
tables. So the trick is to generate a in-memory very small JPEG-compressed TIFF with the 
same settings as the real image, extract the JpegTables tag from it, and apply it right away to 
the real IFD. Obvious, isn't it ;-) ?

Vincent,

Are you talking about the order of th band regarding their color interpretation ? You can 
indeed have Band 1 = Blue, Band 2 = Green, Band 3 = Red in some cases. GDAL drivers will not 
reorder them to be in R,G,B order. If you need this, you need to handle that at the application 
level, by for example issuing Dataset RasterIO with the 3,2,1 order. You could also create a 
VRT that reorder the bands.

gdal_translate -b 3 -b 2 -b 1 -of VRT in_bgr.tif out_rgb.vrt

(you can do that with GDALTranslate() API)

it's not clear to me how useful it is to read/write those new geometry

The Simple Feature model clearly doesn't maintain topological relationships. Topological 
consistency must be checked in a later stage with a IsValid() call for example (this also holds 
true for already handled geometry types). And if you look at some drivers that implement 
TIN currenlty like PostGIS or GML, they are based on the Simple Feature model as well. Only 
shapefile/filegdb has something a bit stronger with shared nodes.

I think that support for topological geometries would be a completely different concept to 
be added in OGR. Would require management of nodes, edges and faces, and conversions 
between simple feature geometries and topogeometries. I had some preliminary discussions 
about that with an interested party in the past but they didn't go further.

In the current state of things, the TIN support should be hopefully good enough for 
conversions between PostGIS, GML, DXF and shapefile/filegdb.

Thank you for the clarification. Since those changes are useful by 
themselves then I change my vote to +1

I am wondering if it is possible to perform the shortest path or network analysis inÂ Windows version of GDAL?
I googled and found gnmanalyse page on GDAL website, which seems to be able to do that:
http://www.gdal.org/gnmanalyse.html

But is this gnmanalyse functionality available only through GDAL C#/python binaries?

I can not access it directly by running GDAL Windows .exe files?

Thank you for the reply.

I declare this motion passed with +1 from JukkaR, DanielM, HowardB and myself.

I will proceed to merge into trunk.

Message-ID: <1481846105491-5300088.post@n6.nabble.com>


Is it possible to change the map style on the VirtualEarth in GDAL?

The current example shows the Aerial Map Style:
http://a${server_num}.ortho.tiles.virtualearth.net/tiles/a${quadkey}.jpeg?g=90"

Is it possible to get the other Bing/VirtualEarth map styles like the road
view or road view with labels?
Is the style controlled by the "a" parameter following the http:://?

What does the g=90 mean?  Is g the direction angle?  (90 being East?).

Thanks!

Elaine

Hi Djordje,

Default build of GNM in GDAL was enabled recently. I think this build is 
not available by GISInternals.

Try our (NextGIS) own build of GDAL from here: http://nextgis.com/borsch/

Best regards,
     Dmitry

Hi Even,
thanks for the feedback!

Since I'm here, I'm bothering you again with another question.
I have regenerated that GeoTIFF using GDAL 2.1.2.
Right now there isn't a useless IFD at the beginning anymore, due to the
improvement you was talking about.
While still checking the data bytes (with an Hex editor and a calculator,
... doh!) I have noticed that there is an unused bytes section between the
last data tile of the main page and the first byte of the second page (it's
a GeoTIFF with overviews).

Here below, some numbers to make you lost :-) You can skip them and go to
the "--------" section.

So the latest TileOffsets of page1 is 0x6BF9, the latest TileByteCounts is
0x095D resulting into last byte for Page1 is 0x7555.
The next referred IFD is 0xBBF0 which for the TileOffsets refer back the
0x7A64 byte.
Checking IFD, TAGs and what else, there is some useless bytes in the range
0x7556-0x7A63.
Going to 0x7556 I have found 13 TAG Definitions (some of them are also
TileOffsets/TileByteCounts Tag referring to an address containing nothing).
----------
Wondering if when generating overviews we still have a problem similar to
the one you have fixed in 2.0 or some data-updating issue.

These are my hypothesis on what is going on.
A simple translate with no overviews makes the file ending at 0x7555 with
offset of next IFD saying 0x0000.
When you add overviews, it writes a new IFD at 0x7556 with TAG entries,
then it encodes something and then it writes a new IFD.
At the end, it goes back updating the offset of the 1st overview IFD
(0xBBF0) making the one at 0x7556 being not referred anymore.
Does it make sense?

Please let me know and sorry for all these numbers.
Daniele

With JPEG compression right ? I do reproduce something similar to your findings in 2.1 
indeed. This no longer happens in trunk due to related improvements (https://
trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/CloudOptimizedGeoTIFF), I made in the last couple of weeks (using 
the same trick of creating a in-memory TIFF file to get the JPEG tables and set them direcly 
on the overview IFD at creation time).

Right,
Indeed, before sending my previous email I have also tried with:
*gdaladdo -r average --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW DEFLATE --config
PHOTOMETRIC_OVERVIEW RGB*
to understand if it was related to JPEG only but, even with these options,
the output overviews were jpeg compressed (I assume there is some kind of
coherency check in gdaladdo).

Do you think this will be available in other series or does it introduce
new API/major changes which makes it available on 2.2.x only?
Thanks again for your precious feedbacks.

With internal overviews, the _OVERVIEW configuration options are ignored. Their value is 
deduced from the settings of the main IFD. I don't think there's a strong technical reason for 
that. Mostly a side effect of the fact that there are slightly different code paths to handle 
creation of internal and external overviews, and the reading of _OVERVIEW config options is 
done only in the external overview code path.

No API change, but this is in the improvement category rather than bugfixing, and my first 
changeset resulted in some corrupted images in some situations, which was unnoticed for a 
few weeks, so that's a sign that it is a somewhat risky change (the GeoTIFF driver is a complex 
beast), not worth the trouble of breaking stable branches.

Message-ID: <1672408.rbHrtlkYkO@even-i700>

Hi,

below an invitation from the OSGeo board for projects to mention their budget needs for 
2017.
We could potentially ask for funds to cover, at least partially, expenses of people who attend 
code sprints (not completely sure if funds can be allocated for that), like the Daytona code 
sprint in February (I won't be able to attend unfortunately). Who might be interested in such 
a support ?
Any other ideas ?

Dear OSGeo project members,

It is this time of the year, OSGeo is looking forward to 2017. Over the
previous years, OSGeo has been proud to support a growing number of project
events, such as code sprints, developer meetings, and user conferences.

To plan for next year, the OSGeo board is reaching out to all committees,
including PSCs. We would like to ask you to help us with proposals for you
planned event support requests for 2017. This information will help us to
set aside a realistic amount of funds.

Please join GRASS, QGIS, Geoserver, and the ZOO-Project and send me your
requests or add them to the budget draft yourself at:

https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/OSGeo_Budget_2017#Draft_2017_Budget

ideally until Monday Dec, 19th.

Thank you and best wishes,

Anita Graser

Even,

I tried the daily build from 9-Dec-2016.  The new ZoomLevel parameter is
there and the value is extracted.  Unfortunately, GDAL is still using the
maximum tile level from the capabilities document.

USGS hasn't responded to my request to fix their capabilities documents. 
ESRI's world time zones WMTS server appears to have the same problem.  The
capabilities advertises more zoom levels than are available.

Message-ID: <CAAGkx0vndxNAwrfdHpB4Vs_941Z9xVs=sxZEXqsTwMBVK6ELjw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I'm trying to add python3 support to a personal project:

https://github.com/granularag/pyspatial/tree/feature/python2_3_support

My unit tests pass with python2, but fail with python3.  I'm getting the
following errors:

StopIteration

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

SystemError: <built-in function delete_SpatialReference> returned a result
with an error set

During handling of the above exception, another exception occurred:

SystemError: <built-in function delete_Geometry> returned a result with an
error set

I recently compiled a local GDAL 2.1.2 and am running the tests as follows:

#!/bin/bash
set -e
set -x

export GDAL_HOME=$HOME/local
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GDAL_HOME/lib
nosetests -v

Has anyone see these errors before?  My system wide gdal is 1.11.2 that I
am using for python 2.  I tried using my system wide GDAL with python3 as
well, but get the same errors.

Not sure what the difference is here between the python2 and python3
versions.

My python versions are 2.7 and 3.5.

Is this a known problem?  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks!
Aman

To answer, the person must be from the ââGeosciences area
(Cartography/Surveying, Geography, Forestry, Geology, Geophysics,
Oceanography, Agronomy)
or anyone who has already used some GIS (ArcGIS, QGIS, etc).

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Message-ID: <E8951863-F7A4-46D1-B566-840C388277F5@gmail.com>

Hello gdal devs!

Iâve got an 8-bit 3-band (RGB) GeoTiff file created in ArcGIS and it has a mask file (myfile.tif.msk) along with it, indicating which pixels have "nodata" value. When viewing it in ArcMap, I get ânodataâ for masked pixels. But when viewing in QGIS, I get an unmasked raster and masked pixels return pixel values of R G and B bands. Gdalinfo doesnât return a .tif.msk file in a list of dataset files (however it does return .aux.xml).

My goal is to add an internal mask band to GeoTiff files, so everything is packed within one file, and create a VRT mosaic afterwards. Another option is to use .tif.msk file as is. But I canât find any options to gdal_translate, or gdalinfo to force gdal use the mask file. There isnât much gdal documentation regarding .msk files. How can I read mask file with gdal and convert my initial RGB GeoTiff to a GeoTiff with a mask band from it?

Cheers,
Nick

If you look at a valid .msk file generated by GDAL, you'll see INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_x
metadata item being reported. If there's no INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_x for band x,
then GDAL will ignore the .msk file for this band.

$ gdalinfo with_mask.tif.msk
Driver: GTiff/GeoTIFF
Files: with_mask.tif.msk
Size is 50, 50
Coordinate System is `'
Metadata:
  INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_1=2
  INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_2=2
  INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_3=2
Image Structure Metadata:
  COMPRESSION=DEFLATE
  INTERLEAVE=BAND
Corner Coordinates:
Upper Left  (    0.0,    0.0)
Lower Left  (    0.0,   50.0)
Upper Right (   50.0,    0.0)
Lower Right (   50.0,   50.0)
Center      (   25.0,   25.0)
Band 1 Block=50x50 Type=Byte, ColorInterp=Gray


The 2 here comes from the following GMF_ enumeration and so means that it
is a mask valid for all the bands of the dataset.

/** Flag returned by GDALGetMaskFlags() to indicate that all pixels are valid */
#define GMF_ALL_VALID     0x01
/** Flag returned by GDALGetMaskFlags() to indicate that the mask band is
 * valid for all bands */
#define GMF_PER_DATASET   0x02
/** Flag returned by GDALGetMaskFlags() to indicate that the mask band is
 * an alpha band */
#define GMF_ALPHA         0x04
/** Flag returned by GDALGetMaskFlags() to indicate that the mask band is
 * computed from nodata values */
#define GMF_NODATA        0x08

You can add this flag with gdal_translate :

gdal_translate my_invalid.tif.msk my_valid.tif.msk -co COMPRESS=DEFLATE \
 -mo INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_1=2 -mo INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_2=2 -mo INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_3=2

See:
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc15_nodatabitmask
http://gdal.org/frmt_gtiff.html ("Internal nodata masks" section)

But it is true that the details of .msk files were not mentionned. I've just
improved that withhttps://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/36955 and
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc15_nodatabitmask?action=diff&version=16&old_version=15

Once your mask is fixed to be recognized as explain above, you can create an 
internal mask with:

gdal_translate in_with_external_mask.tif out_with_internal_mask.tif --config GDAL_TIFF_INTERNAL_MASK YES

But note that QGIS does not handle GDAL mask band currently. You'll have to
transform the binary mask band as an alpha channel instead

gdal_translate rgb_with_mask.tif rgba.tif -b 1 -b 2 -b 3 -b mask

Actually looking at the code and experimenting, that's super weird. The .msk file 
should always be listed in the file list, even if there are no INTERNAL_MASK_FLAGS_x 
metadata item. Does gdalinfo on the .msk file succeed ?

You are probably not using a trunk build or a recent enough trunk build. 
Your XML works fine for me and results in level 14 being fetched.

Even,

Ah!  You are correct.  I just loaded the 17-Dec-2016 daily stable branch. 
Wrong one.

Thank you for checking the syntax for me.  WMTS should be good to go for the
next release of GDAL.
I have 5 other map server types working correctly now.

Thanks for your help!

Elaine

Subject: [gdal-dev] Problem when creating overviews for large input files
	with gdaladdo
Message-ID: <1d2cd0fd-1885-4294-0f85-5c526ba0928a@gmx.net>

Dear all

I ran into a problem when trying to create overviews for large 
LZW-compressed GeoTIFF images using gdaladdo. The TIFF's are internally 
tiled, the file type is Byte. GDAL versions tested are 2.1.1 and 1.11, 
running on 64bit Linux.

The first try was using an input file of size 1038336 x 565248 pixels. 
Setting CPL_DEBUG=ON the processing goes up to the message

...10...20...30...40...50...60...70..GDAL: Potential thrashing on band 1 
of tileindex_nodsm_otsu_2

and then it remains at this "70.." % forever, with no further log 
output. This happened for all files of similar size, on multiple 
machines, on both GDAL versions. Always hangs at this "70.." state, the 
process remains alive but nothing is written any more to the output 
file. I used the command like

gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW  INPUT_FILE 2 4 8 16 32 64

Trying to specify BIGTIFF or not for the overview did not make any 
difference.

Using a smaller file or converting the large input file to 50% size and 
running the gdaladdo on this smaller file finished successfully, but 
also here I got some warnings of a similar kind, and the process got 
stuck for a while after the ".70..GDAL: Potential thrashing..." warning, 
but then continued to the end. The full log is attached.

An additional observation I made was that the overview file stopping at 
70% was already bigger than the input file.

I was thinking to create single lower resolution files and merging them 
to an overview file, but there's no built-in functionality for this, so 
did not follow it up further.

Could there be a sort of limitation of maximum pixels x*y, or with the 
LZW compression? Any ideas how this could be solved?

Thanks in advance for any hint
Armin

Armin,

This is a "well known" performance issue with the geotiff driver / libtiff when switching back 
and forth between IFD (image file directories). At ~ 75%, you start generating overview 
factor 4 and that implies switching regularly between the one previously computed (read 
operations) and the new one (write operations). Each time you switch, you need to read and 
write the TileOffsets and TileByteCounts tags (those can be 10's of megabytes large on huge 
file, and are the root cause for the performance problem). With infinite patience, this would 
eventually complete.

A trick you can use is :

gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW  INPUT_FILE 2
gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW  INPUT_FILE.ovr 2
gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW  INPUT_FILE.ovr.ovr 2
gdaladdo -ro --config COMPRESS_OVERVIEW LZW  INPUT_FILE.ovr.ovr.ovr 2

Hi Even

thanks a lot for the fast reply and the explanation! I will try your 
workaround. The patience needed to wait for the completion of the 
"normal" method seems to be a bit too high, I stopped the last test 
after 4 days...

Best
Armin

Even, thanks a lot for replying.

No, the strange thing is neither gdalinfo, nor gdal_translate work on my .msk file.
Gdalinfo returns "not recognized as a supported file formatâ. Though this .msk works ok in ArcGIS.
I can even export raster from ArcGIS with baked-in mask (like setting output to 16-bit and nodata value to 256 (anything bigger than 255)).
But then I donât know how to get gdal translate it back to 8 bit with adding a mask band from pixels with value of 256. Is that possible?

Cheers, 
Nick

Oh, then that's really an ArcGIS specific thing. Not even a regular TIFF

Use gdal_translate -a_nodata 256 in.tif out.tif

Subject: [gdal-dev] Read error on large VRT files
Message-ID: <b2185561-95c8-15a6-1d4a-3e75011fc48c@gmx.net>

Hi all

I sometimes get read errors when trying to convert large input VRT files 
into a single BigTIFF file, typically applying an outsize of e.g. 50% or 
25%. Errors are like

ERROR 1: TIFFFillTile:Read error at row 11264, col 11264; got 46 by
tes, expected 84
ERROR 1: TIFFReadEncodedTile() failed.

ERROR 1: 2352/2592_BUCNFD.tif, band 1: IReadBlock failed at X offset 45, 
Y offset 47

The tile that returns the error can be converted alone without problems.
All together the number of tiles of the VRT can be towards 6000, having 
100 GB in total, tiles are LZW or Deflate compressed TIFF's.


Is there a possible source of errors when trying to read and convert 
VRT's of compressed TIFF of that size?

Thanks for any hint

Armin

On which option did you play exactly ?

The TIFF error you get is a rather low level one (really trying to read a range of bytes from 
a file), and I can't explain why GDAL options would play a role on it.

I meant the GDAL_MAX_DATASET_POOL_SIZE option. Don't know if it really 
has any influence, but these read errors happened multiple times in the 
past when trying to translate VRT's with lots of input files, for tiles 
that were actually readable. It could be of course also a problem of the 
network file system, short network time-outs etc.

Hi all,
sorry if this is not the right list. Please redirect me elsewhere in case.
I cannot give a transparency to NULL when creating a coloured raster:

gdaldem color-relief -alpha temp_clip.tif byr.txt temp_col.tif -of GTiff

where byr.txt is:

0% 5 113 176 255
25% 146 197 222 255
50% 247 247 247 255
75% 244 165 130 255
100% 202 0 32 255
nv 255 255 255 0

I tried several other combinations, but I cannot hava a transparency of
NULLs.
Where am I wrong?
All the best.

Paolo,

This works for me as expected with the following input raster (and using your palette):

$ cat wrk/in.asc
ncols        2
nrows        2
xllcorner    440720.000000000000
yllcorner    3750120.000000000000
cellsize     60.000000000000
NODATA_value 0
 107 123 
 0 100

$ gdaldem  color-relief -alpha  wrk/in.asc wrk/palette.txt wrk/out.tif

$ gdal_translate wrk/out.tif /vsistdout/ -of aaigrid -b 4
ncols        2
nrows        2
xllcorner    440720.000000000000
yllcorner    3750120.000000000000
cellsize     60.000000000000
 255 255
 0 255


Perhaps there's an issue with the nodata value of your raster ?

Hi Even,

maybe; I have created it with:

gdalwarp -q -cutline mcp_buf.shp -tr 0.0015703125 0.00038671875
temperature.tif temp_clip.tif

How do I check?

Thanks.

Look at the nodata value reported with

gdalinfo temp_clip.tif

If there's none, then you've spotted the issue and you need to define one with -dstnodata

exactly, it works now with

gdalwarp -dstnodata -999 -q -cutline mcp_buf.shp -tr 0.0015703125
0.00038671875 output/temperature.tif output/temp_clip.tif

thanks a lot

Subject: [gdal-dev] C++11 timeline
Message-ID: <CACmBxysv7H=MP1iV+O=sHfh4Z8teuuvic7mgQrGiSmpeC_fmcw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I would like to continue the C++11 discussion over the next couple weeks
while many people are on slower development cycles with a proposal:

* Starting 2017-Mar-01, we switch GDAL trunk to require C++11 support from
the compiler.
* All prior branches would stick with their existing requirements for C++03
support

I had come up with a bunch of other things for a timeline, but they all see
like noise after Even pointed out a whole ton of issues my thoughts.  This
isn't as aggressive as I would like, but it would definitely help reduce
the maintenance burden on humans and reduce the test load for continuous
integration.  I removed explicit mention of OS or compiler versions which I
had in my initial thoughts.

This would not be a free-for-all on C++11 features.  I think we would want
to just start with removing some of the macros and workarounds that are
currently in the code base.  Until we decide to go forward with other
features, the main changes that would happen in C++ only code after this
would be:

- Change NULL to nullptr
- Drop virtual when using the override keyword (this becomes a req with
C++17)
- CPL_OVERRIDE -> override
- Remove HAVE_CXX11 #ifs
- And maybe some other things I missed

Once those are all done, we can then discuss when to allow things like
unique_ptr internally (which will allow some serious simplification of some
code).

Then at some later time, we can discuss what API changes to allow, when to
require C++14, C++17, C11, etc.

Thoughts?

-kurt

e.g.

find . -name \*.cpp -o -name \*.h | xargs grep -i override | grep virtual |
wc -l
    3998

find . -name \*.cpp -o -name \*.h | xargs grep CPL_OVERRIDE | wc -l
     712

find . -name \*.cpp -o -name \*.h | xargs grep HAVE_CXX11 | wc -l

Hi Dmitry,
I apologize for taking me too long to reply back.
Thank you for the suggestion and information!

Happy New year holidays to you and your family!

  I am wondering if it is possible to perform the shortest path or network analysis inÂ Windows version of GDAL?
  I googled and found gnmanalyse page on GDAL website, which seems to be able to do that:
  http://www.gdal.org/gnmanalyse.html
  
  But is this gnmanalyse functionality available only through GDAL C#/python binaries?
 
 I can not access it directly by running GDAL Windows .exe files?
 
 Thank you for the reply.
