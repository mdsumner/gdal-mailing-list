Frank,

I have added the following few lines to gt_wkt_srs.cpp. It seemed a shame n=
ot to take advantage of the EPSG data if it was present. It would be nice i=

Roger,

I agree with the concept and have submitted your suggestion in Bugzilla
as bug 211 (http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=211).

However I would also note:
o If there are EPSG code numbers in the WKT via the AUTHORITY[] mechanism
that should be utilized.
o Even if we write the PCS code I would still like to write out the full
projection parameters.

Best regards,

ogr_api.o is already in GDALmake.opt.in. Perhaps you hadn't rerun
configure?

Hi Frank,

I think I found my problem
I updated gdal, compiled it, but didn't install
(10SEP02). Same for openev.

Later I updated/install openev & 
install gdal (now out of sync)

So I went right into gdal to fix it.
My modification appened to be the same as the one
in cvs so diff was silent (from what I can see
from cvs annotate.)

The morale of the story:
1-update downstream stuff first
2-compile/install/RUN
3-then try to fix

I went the other way around :(

Sorry for the 'noise'!

rgds,

Sylvain.

Subject: small gdal_translate modification 
Message-ID: <annun8+lsa8@eGroups.com>

Hello,

I needed a method to insert metadata into a gdal_translate. 
Specifically, something like: 

gdal_translate -mo 'TIFFTAG_DOCUMENTNAME=c37118a2ne_v1' \ 
-mo 'TIFFTAG_IMAGEDESCRIPTION=TINEMAHA NE - 1:12000 DOQ-Q' \
-mo 'TIFFTAG_SOFTWARE=CaSIL Processed' \
-mo 'TIFFTAG_DATETIME=1998:04:15 00:00:00' \
-co TFW=YES \
c3711863.nws.866031 c37118a2ne_v1.tif

I'm including my mods to gdal_translate, though really this is a
feature request I guess. Mods below don't allow multi-valued tags,
and don't check TIFFTAG format. They overwirte source metadata of
same KEY.

Quinn,

I have added the feature but used some slightly different mechanisms
internally. In particular, I only set the metadata on the output dataset,
or the intermediate virtual dataset (when used).

Your code sets the metadata on the source dataset that is to be copied, and
for now that works OK but it violates my mental model, which is that only the
driver should be able to set metadata on a read-only data source, and that this
metadata would represent the actual contents of the source dataset. While
currently nothing stops you from adding metadata to the source dataset
eventually something might, so that approach should be avoided.

Also your mechanism provides no means to add metadata to raster bands,
just at the dataset level. But it is an improvement over nothing.

A more generalized mechanism for altering things like metadata, georeferencing
and so on, is to use gdal_translate to copy a file to a "virtual" file via
the "VRT" format. Then edit the XML virtual file and add/fix anything
necessary, like metadata, then copy the virtual file again with gdal_translate.

Thanks for your contribution.

Best regards,

Subject: OpenEV_FW 1.5.1 Binary Release for Linux (Beta)
Message-ID: <3DA14069.803@p...>

Folks,

I am trying to put together an interim release for OpenEV that is sort
of like the OpenEV_FW series of releases for Windows. With as many formats
built into GDAL as possible, and more utilities for stuff like GDAL, PROJ.4,
and OGDI.

My first attempt is (or should soon) be available at:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/pub/gdal/openev/openev_FW_linux_1.5.1.tar.gz

This includes:

OpenEV - (CVS snapshot)
GDAL - 1.1.7.3 (CVS snapshot). Includes support (above base formats) for
GML, VPF and RPF via OGDI, GRASS, FITS, JPEG-2000 (prototype),
PostGIS and HDF.
PROJ.4 - 4.4.5+ (CVS snapshot)
OGDI 3.1.1
Python 2.2.1

Gillian, a few minor items that might be of interest for the official releases:

o I use the SGI "OSS" libGLU since the Mesa one you were using seemed semi
hosed to me.

o I used builds of libGTK without debug information to shrink things a bit.

o I updated to Python 2.2.1.

o I modified the openev startup script a bit to set OPENEV_HOME, so that
it doesn't get confused if another OPENEV_HOME is already set.

BTW, the Python 2.2.1 tree is just huge. It is 20MB out of 52MB when the
tree is unpacked. I trimmed a few things out of the default tree (like it's
XML support).

So, if a few people could try downloading this 17MB distribution and run it
I would appreciate it. Let me know if you have any problems with shared
libraries.

PS. This OpenEV uses the C API for OGR. It should be relatively easy for
people to build their own GDAL locally and have it override the one I am
distributing if they need specific formats that aren't included. However,
I have tried to include almost everything.

Best regards,

Peter,

I think the folks who work on DODS have already written NetCDF support for
GDAL. James, could you comment on that? What happened with regard to
migrating your GDAL DODS driver back into the GDAL core?

Also, others (ie. Norman Vine) have expressed an interest in having NetCDF
support in GDAL.

Best regards,

Hi All

It would be nice to have native GDAL support for NetCDF
but it is relatively easy to use a Python bridge

Here is a Python snippet that will transform an arbritrary GDAL grid
into a NetCDF grid

Hi
I've bought some data.
These are Landsat FAST-L7A.
As yuo know; the FAST-L7A format derives from FAST-C format modified to
accommodate the features of the Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+)
instrument on board Landsat 7.
Perhaps gdal doesn't support this format?
I'm saying this; because I can import the into a gis with gdal (GRASS).
If not supported. Can we hpoe them to be supported in a near future?

Thanks,

Do you try the latest GDAL snapshot from the CVS?

No. I've got gdal 1.1.7. Isn't this the last version?

In other hand I'm afraid that I don't know how to use the CVS tree to find 
anything.

Thank you, anyway.

Hi,

It is last released version, but FAST support have been added to
GDAL after 1.1.7.

You should install CVS utility and follow instructions:

% export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@c...:/cvsroot
% cvs login
Password: anonymous
% cvs checkout gdal

Frank,

Do you know anything about MrSID file format? I can't find any
information except advertising slogans. It seems that MrSID widely used
for storing geographical data.

Try the source

their support for developers is going down everyday, so you might be
frustrated. ECW seems to be getting it right.

Best regards,
Paul.

Subject: New OpenEV_FW Release
Message-ID: <3DB859D9.4070205@p...>

Folks,

I have prepared a new binary release of the OpenEV_FW suite of tools on
Linux and Windows.

Windows:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/gdal/openev/OpenEV_FW_152.zip

Linux:

ftp://ftp.remotesensing.org/gdal/openev/openev_FW_linux_1.5.2.tar.gz

They are both build from GDAL and OpenEV CVS within the last week or so
though the build options enabled for each vary. Note, the linux build also
includes JPEG2000 support now with GeoJP2 (georeferenced JPEG2000). Anyone
interested in experimenting with this should let me know.

Best regards,

Agus,

Sorry about this. My mistake. I didn't update the libgeotiff.so in the new
distribution even though the new libgdal code depends on it.

You can download the following and drop it in your openev_FW/lib directory
for now. I will update the linux binary distribution this afternoon.

ftp://gdal.velocet.ca/pub/outgoing/libgeotiff.so

Best regards,

Subject: Contract Work Prospects
Message-ID: <3DBF857C.4010501@p...>

Folks,

I often have chunks of work I would like to subcontract if I could find
people willing to work for a modest wage and who have good knowledge of
various libraries and applications I work on. Some of this work is not
work I am paid for by clients, but just maintenance I would like to get done
so I can concentrate on paid work!

What I am looking for is someone who:
o is looking for part time contract work. The amounts of work will be
variable and should not be depended on as a primary income!
o has good internet access.
o has a *good* knowledge of one or more of OGR, PROJ.4, GDAL, OpenEV, and
MapServer.
o has a passion for GIS, and geospatial work, and open source solutions.
o is a skilled C/C++ programmer.
o has good written english communication skills.

It would be a bonus if the person is actively using/programming with the
listed packages as part of their "day job". Also knowledge of Python is
an asset.

The pay would be modest. This is not work that is likely to be very
attractive to consultant/contractors in high wage countries. Especially
since some of the work will be funded directly out of my pocket and
done in an exploratory fashion. Exact pay would depend on applicable
experience but would start out quite low by North American standards.

Once I am comfortable with a partner I would be willing to include the person
for joint contract work where it makes sense or pass over contracts I don't
have time for directly to them. Note that this may require a quite a high
comfort level as I wouldn't feel right about recommending someone to my
clients unless I am confident in their work.

I already work on a similar basis with Andrey Kiselev, primarily for GDAL
and libtiff related work and I am pleased with how that is going, but Andrey
has a finite amount of time he can spend doing work outside his full time
work.

In the short term my most pressing needs are in OGR, improving existing
vector translators, and adding additional ones. I also have substantial
outstanding maintenance items for PROJ.4, and lots of things I would like
to do with OpenEV.

Any interested parties should reply directly to me.

Best regards,

Subject: Improvements to Arc/Info Grid Support
Message-ID: <3DC0A4F3.3000301@p...>

Folks,

I have have made some improvements to the Arc/Info Binary Grid reading
support in GDAL. Notably:

o Type 0xFF blocks are now supported. They are actually CCITT RLE compressed.
I have cribbed a big chunk of code out of libtiff for decompressing these.

o I have added lots of robustness improvements so that corrupt data is much
less likely to crash the reader code.

Anyone using the grid code in isolation can download a new aitest_dist.zip
from the arc/info grid project page.

Best regards,
