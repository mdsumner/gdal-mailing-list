Martin,

The definition is in ESRI WKT format.  If you save it
to a text file called out.wkt you can do the following in 
a translation to reproject input latlong points to this
coordinate system. 

ogr2ogr  -s_srs WGS84 -t_srs ESRI::out.wkt  out_dir indatasource

Most comandline options for GDAL/OGR tools that accept a
coordinate system will allow you to give the name of a file 
containing WKT.  And if you prefix the filename with ESRI:: 
the library will interprete the WKT as being ESRI WKT and
convert to "standard" format accordingly. The -s_srs switch
is assigning a source coordinate system to your input data
(in case it didn't have this properly defined already), and the
-t_srs is defining a target coordinate system to reproject
to.

I'm trying to write out a NITF file and I need a little help.  This is
the first time I've tried writing a file with GDAL so I'm in unfamiliar
territory here.  I can write the file with all of the raster data, but
I'm getting stuck on the georeferencing.  I know the lat/lon/alt of my
images corner points but I'm not sure how to write that to the NITF file.
Any help is appreciated.  Thanks.

Hi,

I don't mean to be a pain, but this is a show stopper!

Running Red Hat FC2, neither FW tools, or building the latest
versions of Proj.4 and GDAL from CVS allows gdalwarp
to working without error with the samples images
on the remotesensing ftp site.

Has anyone else (running the same config) had these errors?

Thanks,

Hi GDAL Listers, 

I'm trying to use the gdal_merge distributed with the Windows binary of 
OpenEv_FW_182 to merge a large number of tiled JPEGs with this command line

(most of the filenames were omitted for this example). 

C:\OpenEV_FW\python\python.exe  C:\OpenEV_FW\pymod\gdal_merge.py -o Y:\isa03jpgm\camd_isa03_83m.jpg
-of JPEG  -v 6876.jpg 6877.jpg 6878.jpg 6879.jpg

and I am getting this error message:

'import site' failed; use -v for traceback
ERROR 6: GDALDriver::Create() ... no create method implemented for this format.

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "C:\OpenEV_FW\pymod\gdal_merge.py", line 412, in ?
    t_fh.SetGeoTransform( geotransform )
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'SetGeoTransform'


Can someone offer a solution? I'm not well versed enough yet in Python to
figure out (or fix) the error referenced on line 412.

Also, I have PYTHONHOME and OPENEV_DIR env vars set, and added everything

conceivable to my path, but could not get the gdal_merge.bat file to run.

The error I get is "'python' is not recognized as an internal or external

command, operable program or batch file." - so that's why I'm explictly 
calling the python exe and the gdal_merge script. There's got to be a better

way, I just don't know what it is yet. Some advice there would also be 
appreciated.

Thanks for the help,

Hi,

Have you set your PYTHONPATH variable?  If you look at the batch file 
used to launch openev,  that should tell you what environment settings 
you need to run openev and its utilities.

 From your last message, it looks like gdal_merge is failing to create 
the output dataset/file properly (line 410 is returning None).   Are 
there any messages before that traceback?  I assume you have write 
permission for the Y directory?  You could also try GTiff as an output 
format instead of JPEG in case it's an output format-specific problem, 
and recompress after if that works.

Norman, 

I would suggest you file a bug in bugzilla with all
the needed supporting data for me to reproduce your
problem, including the pointer to the FWTools build for
linux that you were using.  If I can reproduce it with the
FWTools build I should have a much better chance of fixing
it.  You will unfortunately need to re-describe the stuff you
already explained to me when I last tried to reproduce the
problem as I have tossed it all once that discussion was done.

Ken,

Are you doing this with calls to the API or just using
gdal_translate?  Usually the easiest way to associate
georeferencing to a raw image is to write a world file for
it.  Many of the drivers, notably including the TIFF driver, 
support world files.  Then you could just gdal_translate to 
NITF, also setting the -a_srs WGS84 switch to let GDAL
know the coordinates are geodetic.  

If you need details on how to prepare a world file let me know.
If you are using the API you should just be able to do 
a SetGeoTransform() call.  The geotransform is essentially
the same values you would put in a world file though in a
different order.

Sorry, I wasn't clearer.  I'm using the API.  I think I figured it out,
finding the function GDALGCPsToGeoTransform() allowed me to pass in the
corner points and generate the geotransform I needed.  I get a NITF out
and so far it looks correct.

I have seen it when the output format doesn't support geographic
coordinate,so you can try use geotiff format.

Hi,

I had this error yesterday, just edit out the format as follows
(from http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/gdal_building.html)

If you find build problems with one of the format drivers that you don't 
care about, just remove the format from the GDAL_FORMATS line at the 
bottom of gdal/GDALmake.opt, do a make clean, and make. This will drop 
it from the build and default runtime registration.

Folks,

I have dropped the ilwis support out of GDALmake.opt.in
for now.  I have contacted the author about other problems already,
and I will pass this issue on as well.

So I just wanted to reduce the resolution of a NTF file I have by 50%.
Naively I just ran gdal_translate:

-bash-2.05b$ gdal_translate -outsize 50% 50%
02SEP19145640-M2AS-000001200012_01_P001.NTF
02SEP19145640-M2AS-000001200012_01_P001_50%.NTF

Unfortunately I'm now left with an image that has nearly no colors (all
black). Below are the outputs of gdalinfo (with metadata removed) Note
the color band information for each. What did I do wrong? I'm running
GDAL 1.2.5.

I do know that the HDF driver has been redone and works differently
in recent GDAL versions

the old driver was
   HDF4_SDS:ASTER_L1B:


checking with gdalinfo recent GDAL version
   HDF4_EOS:EOS_SWATH:
is the driver for ASTER L1B file

revert back to
  OpenEV_FW 1.7.2  (which ises the HDF4_SDS dirver)
or download HEG from
  http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/PRODOCS/misr/tools/geotiff_tool.html
  and run HEG on the HDF to produce georegistered bands as tiffs.


I have not had an opportunity to compare the results of  HEGtools and
 the older HDF_SDS driver.

If you get a chance to compare them
   is there any pixel shift between the two methods or are they  
functionally equivalent.

Ethan,

There are a couple problems with this.  First, since you didn't
specify an output format, it wrote a GeoTIFF file (the default). 
The GeoTIFF format driver does not currently support writing
16bit files with RGB photometric interpretation.  So the photometric
interpretation just gets changed to minisblack which comes through
as undefined I believe. 

You could try requesting the data be written to NITF format using
the -of NITF flags, but I am not convinced that the photometric
interpretation will be properly maintained. 

Best regards,

Hi List,

 

Is there a quick and easy way to handle RPCs with GDAL?  At this point
I'm thinking of going through the RPC equation for each pixel and
turning it into a GCP transformer.  But there has to be a better way.

 

Thanks,

Subject: [Gdal-dev] GEOS Microsoft Visual C++.NET Port Working
Message-ID: <931f8ea9041203083532a2b8aa@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

Sorry for changing the thread topic.  I was worried that folks not 
interested in "gettimeofday" might miss this.  

I have commited a source/Makefile.vc and source/headers/geos/platform.h.vc 
that allow building GEOS with MSCV .NET at the commandline.  Just
cd into source, run VCVARS32.BAT (or whatever it is called for VS.NET)
and then "nmake /f makefile.vc". 

If you have an existing platform.h in headers/geos you will need to
remove it first, so it can be replaced by platform.h.vc.  It seemed
that the geos 2.1.0 tarball included a platform.h though I don't think
it is supposed to. 

I did make a few changes to include files.  Notably, I had to add
alternate declarations for all the class UID values to postfix them with
I64 instead of LL on MSVC.  

There was also the toVector() issue.  I tried changing the derived
classes to define it non-const, but then it didn't override the base
class method so derived classes were lacking an implementation of
the required base class method. 

So, instead, I changed the base class method to return a non-const
result so it matched the signature of all the derived class methods
that were overriding it. 

Currently I am just making a static geos.lib (and the one test
executable - the bigtest TestSweepLineSpeed.exe).   I didn't try
making a DLL as we would need to modify all the class definitions
so they are exported from the DLL.  That was a bit more than I
felt up to today, but I might go back and do it before including
GEOS in my FWTools builds. 

Finally, I haven't tried Norman's suggestion about getting a new
STL port and going at VC6 again, but I may yet do that.  I would
need to before I can include geos in FWTools since it is a purely
VC6 build. 

Please let me know if my changes have broken anything. 

PS. I have also committed a change to the GDAL makefiles so 
it is easy to include GEOS support on windows, and this seems to
working well.  

Best regards,

Eduard, 

I assume hyou mean ESRI SDE datastores?  The short answer
is no, but it does look like I will be implementing at least SDE vector
read support in the next few months.  The the more complex answer
is, perhaps to some degree, soon.

... Frank, Andrey: a related wish.

If possible, please (maybe not possible) have support for
both drivers. the old driver could stay in hdfold/ or whatever
and configure come with a switch.

Currently it is rather inconvenient to retrieve the old
driver from gdal-1.2.0b, remove the new one (which get's
overwritten then with the next 'cvs up -dP') and
install it.

Maybe the new driver will be complete as Chrismas present :-)
but above solution might be a viable interim's solution.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Conversion to Grayscale
Message-ID: <41B0A8FB.1010202@refractions.net>

Do any of the existing gdal tools support converting a color (RGB or 
paletted) image to a grayscale image? I've been using ImageMagick 
"convert" for this, but it takes ridiculously long to do - ie. I can 
reproject the image faster than I can grayscale it - even without doing 
any histogram balancing. I'm guessing it would be relatively easy to 
write a python script to do this - however I know nothing of Python, let 
alone the gdal interface. Has anyone done this already?

Thanks,
Chris Hodgson

Chris, 

Do you want a "proper" RGB to greyscale conversion or is
it sufficient to just take any one of the bands and use it as
greyscale?  I believe a "proper" conversion would involve
a colorspace transformation on the RGB image into IHS or
something like that, and then taking the intensity.  This is
not conveniently available in GDAL but could be implemented
in Python. 

However, if the file is really just a greyscale image represented
in RGB then you could use the -b switch to pick out one band
from the source image to use as the output greyscale image. 

eg. 

gdal_translate -b 1 in.tif out.tif

Here is a quick and dirty to get a NumPy greyscale representation
requires the PIL and the GDAL extensions

Python Imaging extensions <PIL>
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Norman



from PIL import Image,ImageOps
from gdalnumeric import *

def ImageToArray(i):
    a=fromstring(i.tostring(),'b')
    a.shape=i.im.size[1], i.im.size[0]
    return a

myImage = Image.open(filename)

greyImage = ImageOps.greyscale(myImage)

greyScaleNumericArray = ImageToArray(greyImage)

Yes, these are full color images and I would like a reasonably "correct" 
grayscale representation.. I somehow got the notion that simply 
averaging the RGB values would do this... but that sems to be wrong 
based on what Paint Shop Pro does... I don't know much about colorspace 
transformations... all I know is that it shouldn't take as long as 
imagemagick 'convert -colorspace gray' does.

My current problem seems to be that I can't get gdal-python to compile 
(see my next post).

I already had the same problem with lapack, but I was able to find the

Chris,

The problem is this thing about the Python makefile not being
found.  Lacking the numpy include files is not usually fatal
though might mean you lack numpy integration.  Them missing
python makefile likely means you have not installed a python-dev
package or something like that. 

Or my configuration rules might be depending on Python 
methods that are no longer current.  

Would it make sense to use the FWTools linux build for
what you want?  It does include python, numpy etc. 

> I think the problem is with my lack of a "NumPy" lib... so I am now
> trying to get that installed, and Iget te following:

My understanding was that if you build numpy and lack the
required libraries (blas,etc) that it would build with the
internal "lite" version.  That does not seem to be happening
for you.

oooooooh ..... just change these

    pythondir=$python_prefix/lib/python${python_version}/site-packages
    pyexecdir=$python_execprefix/lib/python${python_version}/site-packages

to 

    pythondir=$python_prefix/lib64/python${python_version}/site-packages
    pyexecdir=$python_execprefix/lib64/python${python_version}/site-packages

and you might be good to go

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Byte swapping BIL data?
Message-ID: <20041204181707.GQ2562@vishnu.tridity.org>

I have a BIL file of population data from the Gridded Population of
the World project. GDAL can read the extents of the file, but not the
Float32 data values inside it. I can import the file into GRASS using
r.in.bin, but I have to use the -b switch to do byte swapping to get
the right values out. From this I infer that the dataset has the wrong
endianness, but is otherwise intact.

I note that gdalwarp and gdal_translate don't have byte swapping
options, but gdal.h has a GDALSwapWords() function. Would it make
sense to write a patch for gdal_translate to do byte swapping based on
a command-line switch, or do the GDAL command-line utils already do
this in some fashion that I haven't discovered?

Ok, note to self: RTFS before asking dumb questions on mailing list.

So the .hdr file contains the line "BYTEORDER M". If I run gdalinfo
-mm on the unmodified BIL file, I get min/max values of 0 and 0, which
is clearly not right. (They import into GRASS in the range 0 to
621000, which actually seems correct.)

If I change this to "BYTEORDER L" and run gdalinfo -mm, I get absurdly
large/small nonsense values back (e.g. -1e40), instead of 0, but this
doesn't seem like an improvement in my affairs.

Anyone got any other ideas?

GDAL 1.2.0 has the old driver. GDAL 1.2.1 and later use the newer  
HDF4_EOS driver.

you can compile GDAL 1.2.0 or use the precompiled version in
OpenEV_FW 1.7.2 or use HEGTools to convert the HDF to a GeoTiff.

IIRC there was a discussion the the HDF4_SDS driver did not properly  
(with enough detail and precision) handle the transformation of the  
image using the GCPs in the HDF file.

so you might want to wait for the HDF4_EOS driver to be completed.

I personally find that the HEGTools introduces unwanted artifacts of  
another kind.

I have created 3 GeoTiffs as a sample of the handling in HEG and GDAL  
1.2.0   ( at http:/wms.co.fulton.ga.us/data/gdal/ )

to create the images I started with
  AST_L1B_00311012004163458_11122004131831.hdf
 and created
   http:/wms.co.fulton.ga.us/data/gdal/aster_heg.tif
          with HEGTools and used
          gdal_translate -projwin -86.94204 34.24418 -86.91528 34.21796
          to make a sample of the middle of the image
   http:/wms.co.fulton.ga.us/data/gdal/aster_trans.tif
          with gdal_translate (from GDAL 1.2.0)
          and then used gdal_translate -srcwin 1369 2583 225 220
          to make a sample of the middle of the image
   http:/wms.co.fulton.ga.us/data/gdal/aster_warp
          with gdalwarp (from GDAL 1.2.0) and then used
          gdal_translate -projwin -86.94204 34.24418 -86.91528 34.21796
          to make a sample of the middle of the image

certainly there are small displacements of pixels, comparing the three  
samples but the banding produced by HEGTools is visually distracting.

Hi All,

After fighting with libtool for awhile I finally got the 
GDAL Python extensions to build on Darwin.

The trick was hand editing the generated 'libtool' file 

replacing all occurences of 
  '-bundle'
with
  '-bundle -framework Python'

Woot !

The way I read this, you have a dynamic libtiff that includes a static
libjpeg (probably for JPEG support in TIFF files); this leads to
multiple defined symbol errors when you try to link anything with both
libraries. I'm not aware of any way to force Apple's Mach-O linker to
take the first definition it finds and ignore multiple symbol
definitions, so you'll probably have to rebuild libtiff either

a) without JPEG support
b) after installing a dynamic libjpeg, and linking against that

Of course, it might also work to simply leave the libjpeg.a out of your
link, since it's already included in libtiff.dylib

As far as I can see, you're linking against libgrass, which expects to
find some necessary functions in libfftw.dylib found in
/CLAM_EXTERNAL_LIBS/fftw/lib/libfftw.2.dylib. It doesn't matter if you
have a working libfftw.dylib in /usr/local/lib - the Mach-O dynamic
linker won't look for it there, because MacOS X uses so-called
"two-level" namespaces by default. Basically this means the linker
records (at build time) in which library the dynamic linker should
expect to find which functions. To solve this problem, you could try to
disable two-level namespaces (sorry, I don't have the linker option
commited to memory), or make sure *all* dynamic libraries used are
compiled for and installed in the correct places (most likely 
/usr/local/lib) before linking anything with them. Note that the dylib
itself records where it expects to be installed, so you can't just
copy libraries around. Unfortunately, Mach-O dynamic libraries behave
a bit differently from ELF shared objects.

With kind regards,
Eric

Frank and List,

I noticed to my surprise and delight that there is a critter called
GDALRPCTransformer.  I'm not sure about the path to using the
transformer though.  So, someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  If
were to open an NITF file with RPCs in the header the RPC info would be
put in the metadata for that dataset.  Then I could extract the RPC info
from the metadata and use that info to construct a GDALRPCTransformer
object.  Could that object then be used to warp the dataset?

Thanks,

William,

Yes, that is correct. 

Note that currently the GDALRPCTransformer class does not have a
mechanism to pick up elevation data, so it assumes an elevation of 0.0
over the whole image.  This makes it inappropriate for precision 
rectification of images, but it is still useful for a quick and dirty 
rectification. 

With some additional coding it should also be possible to supply the
elevations as needed, but that might be a bit hairy.   Currently NITF
files with RPC00B segments are the only supported source of
RPC data, but I hope someday to extend it to a variety of other
formats.

I've added the Makefile.vc and platform.h.vc file into the distribution

Hi List!

I heard about GDAL today and I'm impressed. I tried to compile it on my 
WinXP (as described at the website) and it worked out of the box. So 
many many thanks to you all for this work!

Now my plan: I'm interested in using GDAL on Windows CE.NET (which is 
WinCE 4.x) and I wanted to ask if it is possible to compile it for 
WinCE. AFAIK this has never done before, correct? So what is needed to 
cross-compile GDAL on a WinXP machine for the target platform WinCE?

Regards Chris Burkert

PS: I have installed Visual Studio and Windows CE Tools with all the 
header files for CE.NET.

PPS: If there is a lot to patch I'm willing to look at this.

Hi,

The first problem to  address is GDAL Unicode enabling... Maybe some very smart editor commands can do the job without side effects. If you find them, please tell me.

The second is that one must port the format drivers: except PNG and ZLIB at http://www.tenik.co.jp/~adachi/wince/index.html there is AFAIK no open WINCE implementation of LibTiff and other image formats.

Anyhow I am interested if you go ahead.

Hello I was trying to use OpenEV to convert a GeoTIFF to a JPEG2000
(Kakadu version apparently) and It works using the Export utility,
however the quality is degraded significantly and there are no options
to set the compression.  I tried the gdal_translate at the command line
and got the same results (didn't find any command line options to set
compression).  I'm looking to find a free compressor to compress all my
GeoTIFFs to JPEG 2000 format at the lossless rate.

 

Any suggestions?

 

THANKS in advance.

I am not aware of any GDAL port to WinCE.  As Alain points out it is
likely to be a substantial task.

Are you saying that only unicode strings are supported on WinCE?  I 
had built Shapelib for WinCE a while ago and I didn't run into any special
unicode issues, so I am surprised this is necessary.

Franck,

WinCE systems are Unicode only.

You can process char, char*, char& and char[] types as usual, but any string transfer with the system ( file names, error messages etc..) is Unicode.

Many places in GDAL code embed such strings. All these char* or char[] should be changed to TCHAR ( a macro that expands to wchar_t if Unicode is enabled ) , without touching the real char type used in the formats. 

By the way, Unicode enabling GDAL is a very good idea : if coupled with grouping of all message strings and hard-coded names in some resource location, it would open the possibility for non english speakers to use GDAL !

But if it is on your TODO list, I am afraid it gets a very bad scoring.

Thanks for all anyway.

Alain

Alain, 

I can't say unicode enabling GDAL has been high on my priority list. 
It is a sufficiently major job that I think I would need a paying client
who needs the capability enough to foot the bill.  And I hate to think
what complexities it would pose for "normal" applications using
the library the old way.  I would definately want to look at doing
such a conversion in a way not unduely incompatible with what is
done now. 

I am also not keen on translatability of messages.  I just find it hard
to imagine anyone wanting to get error messages from GDAL in
another language badly enough to justify the effort of translating and
trying to maintain all the error messages.  I also don't like messages
getting "too far away" from the code that issues them.  Generally I
have seen this be a recipe for "message rot" where it is too much 
trouble to find the messages and update them when the code changes. 
Knowing my own laziness in this regard I would need a strong 
motivation to make such a change.  Likewise, I do a crappy job at
keeping the format documentation up to date as it is now.  Imagine
how much less likely this would be done well in another language. 

I  guess my point is that I try hard to limit the amount of 
documentation work so as to prevent me and others from just
giving up on it.  I am leery of anything that complicates the effort. 

Best regards,

Franck,

That's why I did not think it was a priority. But a french or japanese translation of gdalinfo might interest. My thinking was to have easier access to the literal stuff and put some translating macros in strategic places. Error messages are never understandable by a regular user. But info could be displayed in user language.

If you, or anyone on the list, are curious of that, you will find the Unicode macros and functions in MS compilers tchar.h headers. Roughly it is something like 
#ifdef UNICODE 
typedef wchar_t TCHAR; 
#else 
typedef char TCHAR;
#endif

Changing the char definitions in GDAL code to TCHAR is a tedious but simple operation. You ask the real question: Who would pay time or money for that ?

Regards

AR

Noureddine,

There is no work on this within the GDAL core.   I think
there have been folks doing c# callouts to GDAL.  The
truth is I don't know what is involved in making GDAL an
easily usable .NET component.

Have a look at the output of:

# gdalinfo --format JP2KAK

and cross-reference it against:

http://www.kakadusoftware.com/Usage_Examples.txt

I don't know about your motivation for converting - however, I found 
that creating lossy files at about 1/10 the size of a GeoTiff were 
visually identical. I used the following options to gdal_convert to get 
this sort of output:

-co 'Clayers=20'
-co 'Clevels=8'
-co 'Corder=RPCL'
-co 'Cprecincts={256,256},{256,256},{128,128}'
-co 'ORGgen_plt=yes'
-co 'Creversible=no'
-co 'quality=10'

Note that decompression is very fast for a single user - however, I 
tried to build a multi-user mapserver using jp2k files and it just 
wasn't viable for me.

Good luck with it.

I am looking for a FREE JP2 compressor/decompressor too and it seems to be
like a quest for the holy grail.

Kakadu is anything but free, unless I misunderstood their licensing
information.

The MrSid SDK is free and is fast, but via Mapserver->Gdal->MrSid SDK it
crashes intermittently.  I have posted to Mapserver group with no response
yet.  Not sure if it is something in the encoding of the source files or
not.

Jasper is free and stable, but as I have it configured, too memory
consumptive and slow for serving data over the Web.

If the elusive free JP2 solution is out there, I haven't found it yet.

Drew.


P.S. Here is a GDB backtrace of a Mapserver shp2img using tile index of
jp2s:

Mitch, 

GDAL is currently using EPSG tables dumped from EPSG 6.5.

I think the major problem with localization of gdal would be choosing
which way to do it - there is the Windows way, the Macintosh way
(actually, there are two Macintosh ways, pre- and post OS X, but
I don't think GDAL would compile on pre-OS X without major effort, so
we can ignore pre-OS X), and the POSIX way. How do you keep it all in
sync, when gdal developers do not know / have access to every platform
gdal can be compiled on ?

With kind regards,
Eric

Subject: [Gdal-dev] JP2 geo info question
Message-ID: <NFBBKOADOLGDLPMAAHMDGEGACNAA.asimpson@i-55.com>

Greetings,

I am trying to re-encode a JP2 with gdal->jasper to see if encoding is
related to a MapServer problem I'm having.

I convert to GeoTiff first and gdalinfo shows all geo information still ok.

Then I convert the GeoTiff to a JP2.

gdalinfo->mrsid sdk on the JP2 reports no geo info.
mrsidinfo on the JP2 reports no geo info.
gdalinfo->jasper on the JP2 reports geo info.

Does Jasper encode the geo info differently in the JP2?
Will this cause issues when rendering maps from mapserver->gdal->mrsid sdk?
If so, can one use a world file for JP2s?

I found mapserver->gdal->jasper too slow for serving maps.

Thanks for any info,
Drew.

Can you post the output just above the error? The gcc line. It would
help identify why the include file ogr_srs_api.h is either not being
found or why the OGRSpatialReferenceH typedef is not being defined.

Hello, 

I installed HDF4.2r0 from source. It seemed to go cleanly.
I have (apparently) successfully configured GDAL with:

./configure --with-hdf4=/usr/local/include
--with-libgrass=/usr/local/lib

When I run make, however, I get the following errors:

Drew,

The GDAL JasPer driver should encode the georeferencing information
as a GeoTIFF embedded in the JP2 file.  I thought that the MrSID SDK
would support this,though I haven't tried it personally. 

It seems you don't have a coordinate system defined.  You might want
to try re-encoding the JP2 including a coordinate system.  It is possible
that the MrSID SDK ignores an embedded geotiff if there is no
coordinate system information. 

I'm not sure if the MrSID sdk will support world files for jp2 files.
I'm pretty sure it does support sdw world files for .sid files though. 
You might want to try .sdw, or .j2w world files and see. 

Best regards,

William,

I haven't run into a problem like this before, but the HDF support isn't
built in all that often.  One thing I notice is that gctp_wrap.c includes
ogr_srs_api.h using angle brackets instead of the double quotes used
elsewhere in GDAL.  Try changing:

#include <ogr_srs_api.h> 

to

#include "ogr_srs_api.h"

in gdal/frmts/hdf4/hdf-eos/gctp_wrap.c and see if that helps. 

Best regards,

Hello Frank,

I made the requested changes to gctp_wrap.c and got the same error messsage. I
previously had some trouble installing the HDF4.2r0 package, but was able to get
it installed after help from their people. I don't really understand the error
messages, so I don't know whether I should try re-installing the HDF package, or
if the problem lies in with the GDAL installation.

Thanks, Bill

dificulty finding reference.

Frank,

j2w works!  I tried jpw and tfw, but not the j2w.
I now have maps rendering from mapserver with these re-encoded jp2s, and no
'assertion failed' crashes.
I re-encoded lossless and only 4 overviews, whereas the originals were lossy
with 11 overviews.  I'll try with more overviews to see if it'll crash.

How would one set the coordinate system? Via API and GeoTiff?

Thanks very much for the help,
Drew.

The GDAL JasPer driver should encode the georeferencing information
as a GeoTIFF embedded in the JP2 file.  I thought that the MrSID SDK

It seems you don't have a coordinate system defined.  You might want

that the MrSID SDK ignores an embedded geotiff if there is no

I'm not sure if the MrSID sdk will support world files for jp2 files.
I'm pretty sure it does support sdw world files for .sid files though.
You might want to try .sdw, or .j2w world files and see.

Cool!   Though you shouldn't have run into all the problems you did.

The -a_srs switch on the gdal_translate commandline can be used to 
assign a coordinate system.  It takes a variety of formats to describe
the coordinate system including PROJ.4 and EPSG codes. 

eg. 

gdal_translate -a_srs EPSG:4326 in.tif out.tif

or

gdal_translate -a_srs '+proj=utm +zone=11 +datum=WGS84' in.tif out.tif

Jack,

That is correct,just the DAP client libraries. But it does need to be a 
fairly recent release to work properly - I think the most recent public
release.

Hi,
    I guess the problem is your uncorrect install of hdf4 lib.
    I have installed gdal 1.2.5 with hdf4 support without problem.
    My system is debian sarge,and I installed the hdf lib by apt-get,so I
don't know what the problem happened by installing.

   Best regards,

My guess is that you haven't passed in your path to your netcdf installation

try --with-netcdf=$PATH_TO_NETCDF_HOME

oops I guess I didn't send my email to the group.
 
It is not a bad hdf4 install if you look at the compile line WIlliam posted you'll see:
 
-I -I../../../ogr
 
Something is missing in the first -I. According to Sean G. mysql is set to be on by default but William has no mysql so the include files for it are not found. It's definitely a bug in the gdal configure.

Hi,
    I guess the problem is your uncorrect install of hdf4 lib.
    I have installed gdal 1.2.5 with hdf4 support without problem.
    My system is debian sarge,and I installed the hdf lib by apt-get,so I
don't know what the problem happened by installing.

   Best regards,

Ethan / William,

The mysql problem doesn't normally manifest like this, but you might
want to try configuring "--without-mysql" to ensure that isn't the problem
you are having.  The "bare" -I is likely the problem.  If necessary you can
just go into GDALmake.opt and remove it from the appropriate variables.

Hello,
 
I am trying to install GDAL in my computer using Visual Studio .NET 2003 command prompt. I am assuming that I don't have to run vcvars32.bat for this. I did cd to GDAL root directory as per the instruction in the website. But when I type the command 
C:\GDAL> nmake /f makefile.vc, I got the error message that nmake is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.
 
Can anybody help me?

Samir, 

In fact, if you didn't have the Visual Studio install setup your environment
variables globally,you will need to run vcvars32.bat in the shell before
you can use the compiler.

Message-ID: <2DBB9F887DAA394FA75D98474EA5730DDB9C3D@vader.prologic-inc.com>

Frank and list,

 

I have discovered that the NITF reader doesn't read image chipping
information from an NITF file (the ICHIPB TRE).  All it really does is
supply 4 tie points (usually the centers of the corner pixels but not
necessarily) from some original image to the data contained in the image
block.  Folks use the ICHIPB info so they can preserve sensor
information and RPCs.  Something I've run into using the
GDALRPCTransformer is:  When I get a pixel and line back from the RPC
calculation, it is in reference to the original image.  I have changed
my local source to read an ICHIPB and followed the same paradigm of the
RPC information by putting it in the nitfdataset's metadata for
extraction later.  Let me know if you'd like to add it to the baseline.

 

Given all this, my question is:  How would you go about translating
coordinates between the two image spaces?  GenImgProjTransformer?

 

Thanks,

 

William Lyons

Thanks Norman, but that's not it  netcdf tree root is /usr/local and
it appears that make is finding them, (otherwise it wouldn't try to
compile it in).  configure detected netcdf without the --with-netcdf flag.
However, I tried as you suggested and got the same result.

Any more ideas?  Just where is this variable supposed to be declared?

Frank,

On my FC 2 system lack of installed mysql did result in a bare -I.
Configuring --without-mysql, as you recommmeded, solved it.

Norman, (or anyone using netcdf prior to v. 3.5.1),

Would you mind doing me a small favor?  Since you're using an earlier
version of netcdf (3.5.0 and I'm using 3.5.1) and you compiled
ok (assumingly) would you mind grep-ing for one of these vars in the
netcdf includes to see if you get anything?  There are some noticeable
differences.  For example, my version of ncgen doesn't even have an
available '--help' options.

nc_inq_var
nc_inq_varndims
nc_get_vara_uchar

I would be indebted. 

Thanks,

Jack Varga

William, 

I gather the ICHIPB TRE is used when the NITF image is a subset of the
original image to which the RPCs apply?  I'm a bit surprised that it is 
legal to emit original RPCs with a subset image.  I would have expected
the RPC to be transformed.   But given that it doesn't work that way, yes
I would indeed be interested in patches that would apply the ICHIPB. 
Ideally I would like a sample image with ICHIPB as well if possible.

> Given all this, my question is:  How would you go about translating
> coordinates between the two image spaces?  GenImgProjTransformer? 

The GenImgProjTransformer() will use an RPC if there is no geotransform
or GCPs on the source image, but I suspect that isn't your question.
If the first "image" space is an RPC controlled image, what is the second
image?  I believe that the GenImgProjTransformer is currently 
asymmetric, in that it allows the source image to use geotransform, gcps
or RPCs but assumes the target image is strictly geotransform based.  So
you couldn't relate pixel/line locations in two RPC controlled images with
that transformer. Of course, the GenImgProjTransformer isn't really all that
complicated.  You can use it as an example to build a particular transformer
you need yourself. 

PS. I'm also working on the NITF code just now integrating JPEG2000 NITF
writing, so it is a good time to send me patches as I am in the NITF head-space,
scary as that may sound.

Jack,

I just downloaded and installed netcdf 3.5.1 on my Debian system
from source and nc_inq_var is defined in netcdf.h.  Is it possible to
are picking up some antique netcdf headers or something? 

My GDAL build against the netcdf 3.5.1 library went without a hitch.

Frank,

I'm thinking about trying to fake a geo-transform between the two image
spaces.  But, I'm not 100% sure what the 6 floats in the geo-transform
really mean.  Could you enlighten me?

William, 

They represent an affine transformation.  There is a reasonable
definition in the
GetGeoTransform() call:

  http://www.gdal.org/classGDALDataset.html#a8

However, I notice the GDALRPCInfo structure (and corresponding
metadata) have fields named dfLINE_OFF, dfSAMP_OFF, dfLINE_SCALE
and dfSAMP_SCALE.  I think it would be much easier to just adjust these
if the change is just a non-rotated windowing. 

Best regards,

Message-ID: <41B9F585.7000905@pobox.com>

Folks,

I had hoped to issue a GDAL 1.2.6 release today, or very soon, but I
am also committing a bunch of changes to the ECW driver that require the
ECW 3.1 (or perhaps later?) SDK.  Basically it needs the very latest
version not yet released by ERMapper.  For that reason I am going to
hold off on the next GDAL release for a bit till that is available.

Anyone building from CVS will likely need to build without the ECW
driver in the meantime, or manually force use of the old ECW code.

I appologise for the inconvenience.

Best regards,

I agree.  But, the chips I'm working with are rotated.  Which leads me
to another question about the geo-transform.  I'm assuming that the
values at indices 2 and 4 are how I would define a rotation.  My
assumption is that the value at index 2 is a ratio of change in x as
line increases and the value at index 4 is a ratio of change in y as
pixel increases.  Please tell me I'm wrong and there's an easier way so
I don't have to calculate these for a rotated chip.

Thanks,

William,

Yes, that is correct, at least roughly. 

I would suggest you just derive corner GCPs and then use the
GDALGCPsToGeoTransform() to compute the correct geotransform.

That's the path I found a few hours ago.  I'm still working on it
though.

We've noticed a problem with reprojecting full 16-bit images when
using biliner or bicubic: the output image is speckled, presumably
due to over/underflow.  As verification, using the 20041210 snapshot
we recklessly replaced all occurrences of "GInt16" with "GUint16" in
gdalwarpkernel.cpp and the problem went away.

The command line to reproduce is just:
  gdalwarp.exe -t_srs EPSG:4326 -rb f.tif ff.tif
where f.tif is a simple 1-banded, 1Kx1K, unsigned, 16-bit geotiff --
whose dynamic range uses all 16 bits.

I've submitted this as #709 to Bugzilla, but the files won't seem to
attach -- they're small, I can mail them as needed.

There has been some postings on this list before about this topic. A google 
search on 'gdal srtm' will probably give you these.
Shortly, the hgt files are simple binary data, but can easily be 'translated' 
into a BIL file (which can be opened by GDAL) by generating the apporpriate 
(text file format) header file. You will find the exact answer on how to do 
this in the earlier postings on this list.

Good luck!

Vincent.

Eduardo,
This question has come up quite a few times in several lists I'm on. (I
asked once, myself.)

First, if you are using a Linux computer or can install Cygwin (from
www.cygwin.org) on your Windows computer you can use this bash script that I
modified from Markus Neteler's website:
http://mpa.itc.it/rs/srtm/

This shell program will change the name of the .hgt to .bil. It then
generates the .hdr and .prj files for the ESRI file reader. Finally, it
launches gdal_translate to build a geotiff from the bil file.

HTH,
Thom

Eduardo,

Or, simply drag your .hgt files into some nice GDAL-based software such as
VTP's VTBuilder, which will automatically recognize the .hgt and load it
directly.

Message-ID: <B78A4DC4AD9EE14FB014E9444BD2D30EF8C761@sea-srv-ms1.lizardtech.com>

Drew and Frank were commenting last week on the MrSID support for GeoJP2
metadata:

> gdalinfo->mrsid sdk on the JP2 reports no geo info.
> mrsidinfo on the JP2 reports no geo info.
> gdalinfo->jasper on the JP2 reports geo info.

It turns out that the report was slightly in error -- the 4.0.x MrSID SDK
and associated tools does in fact read the GeoJP2 data correctly (although
earlier versions may not).

That said, there really *is* a bug being hit by MapServer users.  This
might be related to some earier reports Andrey and I and others had about
the MrSID driver being buggy.  We've got this issue in our bug database
here at LizardTech: we've got a new release coming along in the next
several weeks, and when it's ready for beta I'll try and sync it up with
the GDAL driver and build MapServer and see what we can find.

(If this bug is blocking someone more urgently, feel free to let me know
directly.)

I tried building GDAL 1.2.5 on VC71 this evening.  The first thing i
encountered was the compile error with iostream.h in Tifflib.  Searching the
list archive, i see that Thom DeCarlo reported it a month ago:

However, i didn't find any resolution of this problem in the list archive.
Has it been solved?  Thom's solution was apparently to "comment out the
offending section of tiffio.h", but that doesn't sound like a final
solution.

You can also get SRTM data in Geotiff format from ftp://ftp.glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/glcf/SRTM/

And you have the choice between WRS2 and degree tiles.

You can also get SRTM data in Geotiff format from 
ftp://ftp.glcf.umiacs.umd.edu/glcf/SRTM/

And you have the choice between WRS2 and degree tiles.

You're going to need to do some processing before you can use these

Eduardo,

Or, simply drag your .hgt files into some nice GDAL-based software such as
VTP's VTBuilder, which will automatically recognize the .hgt and load it
directly.

Eduardo,
This question has come up quite a few times in several lists I'm on. (I
asked once, myself.)

First, if you are using a Linux computer or can install Cygwin (from
www.cygwin.org) on your Windows computer you can use this bash script that I
modified from Markus Neteler's website:
http://mpa.itc.it/rs/srtm/

This shell program will change the name of the .hgt to .bil. It then
generates the .hdr and .prj files for the ESRI file reader. Finally, it
launches gdal_translate to build a geotiff from the bil file.

HTH,
Thom

There has been some postings on this list before about this topic. A google 
search on 'gdal srtm' will probably give you these.
Shortly, the hgt files are simple binary data, but can easily be 'translated' 
into a BIL file (which can be opened by GDAL) by generating the apporpriate 
(text file format) header file. You will find the exact answer on how to do 
this in the earlier postings on this list.

Good luck!

Vincent.

Hi Ben,
Yep, that's the solution that was suggested (and implemented in the libtiff
v3.7.1 source). Also, change the #include <iostream.h> to #include
<iostream>.

I'm sure that when Frank has time to sync gdal with libtiff we'll see this
fixed.

< following for the archives since this question 
   seems to come up fairly frequently >

to build GDAL with MingW something like the following should work

./configure --prefix=$PATH_TO_MINGW_ROOT --host=mingw32 \
	--without-libtool --without-python $YOUR_CONFIG_OPTIONS

Then after GDAL is built change your GDALMake.opt file to 
reflect your python installation in my case

PYTHON_INCLUDES = -Ic:/Python22/include
PYTHON_LIBS =  -Lc:/Python22/libs/ -lpython22
PYTHON_CFLAGS =  
PYTHON = yes

below find a heavily hacked version of the setup.py
from the TOP GDAL directory that I just built gdal pymod with 
with my MingW system

Note you will have to change the line in the script below

LIBRARY_DIRS = ["./", "d:/usr/mingw/lib"]

to reflect your local system

You need to build and install the MingW Python Link Library 
http://www.mingw.org/MinGWiki/index.php/Python%20extensions

Once you have done this and have built the rest of GDAL

then using the script below thusly

>python setup.py build --force --compiler=mingw32
>python setup.py install --force

should allow you to do

>python
Python 2.2.3 (#42, Jun  4 2003, 10:33:42) [MSC 32 bit (Intel)] on win32
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import gdal,gdalnumeric
>>> dir()
['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__', 'gdal', 'gdalnumeric']
>>> dir(gdal)
['AllRegister', 'Band', 'CE_Debug', 'CE_Failure', 'CE_Fatal', ........
............
>>> dir(gdalnumeric)
['ArrayType', 'BandReadAsArray', 'BandWriteArray', 'CE_Debug' .......

Note This is unsupported
But It works for me and should work for you if you follow the instructions

I will probably not answer any questions so if you have problems 
please ask then on the appropriate list
i.e Python-Discuss or MingW-Users

Good luck

Norman

Message-ID: <41C17551.4040908@comsine.co.uk>

Hi,

though I would write to tell you about an application of GDAL which you
can all use free of charge.

First of all, thanks Frank for all your help, in particular for 
configuring our
server!!

We are working  as part of a consortium under the ESA (European Space
Agency) MASS project, and it is a research project to investigate 
interoperability
of EOS services using SOAP.

We decided to offer to put a SOAP wrapper around two services.  The first
service being gdalwarp (the reprojection service) and the second service 
being
an orthocorrection service using the python wrappers to GDAL and the very
sexy MapServer WCS for serving SRTM data.

These services can be used individually or chained using the Oracle 
workflow tool.

The reprojection service works exactly the same as gdalwarp, the biggest 
problem
we face is restricting the target projections of gdalwarp for a user to 
something
meaningful, as it is a free research project we haven't overcome this 
(any ideas?).

The second service used the python api to GDAL and requests a SRTM DEM from
a MapServer WCS in 16 bit geotiff format it then orthocorrects the input 
satellite image
using a similar algorithm to (sun) topographic correction.

To try the reprojection service do the following

1) http://services.eoportal.org
2) Choose Services > Data Conversion > CSLReprojection
3) Fill in the following fields

Input Image : 
ftp://anonymous:anonymous@hotmail.co.uk@ftp.remotesensing.org:21/geotiff/samples/pci_eg/latlong.tif 


Error Threshold:
0.125
Sampling method:
nearest neighbour
Warp Polygon Order
CRS:
Common CRS

Then select target CRS to be WGS84

There are many improvements we could make to the HTML interface, in 
particular the specification of the FTP address,
but in practise, most invocations will be through SOAP in a product chain.

(This is the bit to make my Manager happy!!)
ComSine are a SME based in the UK, happy to take on all work,  both 
commercial and research based, part funded, or
wholly funded, www.comsine.com).

Thanks again to GDAL, a very easy to use and robust product.

Hello,

is there a way to select a subdataset of an image which is in another

I cannot use gdal_translate using a subdataset such as:
HDF4_SDS:ASTER_L1B:"C:\image":10

It is ok if my image is in another folder in the same disk, then I can use 
the ../ format to go backwords in the directory.  But no way to go in the 
other disk.  Is there a trick?

Thank you

Hello all (my apologies to those on both lists) ->

  I am attempting a cygwin gcc type of solution to building all of the
dependencies of the open source OpenEV, which includes GTK (glib, pango,
etc.), GDAL, MESA, etc..  Because MESA does not provide a cygwin gcc
makefile, but does seem to have MinGW support, and because GTK provides
precompiled MSVCRT binaries which are supposedly easier to use by apps
built with MinGW instead of cygwin gcc -no-cygwin, I am now trying to
compile GDAL with MinGW.  I've hacked a fix to jmorecfg.h to get the libs
to build, but pymod did not build without some hacks to the paths in the
GDALMake.opt, and now the apps do not build.  Has anyone built this code
with MinGW before, or does anyone have any experiences they can share with
building GDAL and/or these other libraries with gcc or MinGW?  Please
tell me I don't have to succumb to MS...

  Thanks,

-> Pete

Francesco, 
 
This is a bug in the HDF driver.  I have created a bug report on the issue at:

  http://bugzilla.remotesensing.org/show_bug.cgi?id=716

The problem is presumably because we parse some aspects of the string
based on colons.  Hopefully with some work the driver can be altered to 
handle this gracefully especially since the drive specifier is in a
quoted portion

PS. Andrey reports he is hoping to do some substantial work on the HDF
driver in January, so with luck this and a variety of other HDF related issues
can be resolved then.

Yes but it requires a bit of hacking.

The HDF library has an internal NetCDF library
that you can either be exposed or not by tweaking 
the headers   I believe this is in the hdf2netdff.h file

grep HAVE_NETCDF  in the HDF tree for 'hints' about
how to do this

Message-ID: <41C5C45E.7030100@tiscali.it>

Hi all,

I'm trying to compile 1.2.5 version, but on make I have:

gdaldrivermanager.cpp:162: error: `CPLGetConfigOption' undeclared (first 
use this function)

and in fact CPLGetConfigOption is declared in ../port/cpl_conv.h (and 
cpl_string.h is in the same dir). I thought this error was normal in 
this situation ...

My compiler is g++ (GCC) 3.3.1 (Mandrake Linux 9.2 3.3.1-2mdk)

Thank in advance

Hi,

I'm trying to build gdal 1.2.5.  Particulars:

Is this a new version of libxerces-c.so.26 that you just installed? You 
may need to run /sbin/ldconfig to update the runtime lib cache. (Also 
make sure /usr/local/bin is in the /etc/ld.so.conf before you run it.)

Yup, this worked.  Thanks.  I assumed (you know what happens when you
assume) that /sbin/ldconfig only gets run when a new entry is made in
/etc/ld.so.conf.

At any rate, it works now.  When I peruse /usr/local/lib, I find this
hanging around:

-rwxr-xr-x   1 root root 3486188 Jun 16  2004 libgdal.so.1.2.0*

...which is from gdal-1.2.0b.  Is it safe to blow this away?

Depends on whether you still have apps that were compiled with and need 
this version to run. It doesn't hurt to leave it there if you're not 
sure, except for the fact that it's one more (possibly unused) file in 
your lib directory.

Message-ID: <C482FF98AE985A47B8C982FD429C9E34058797@daytonmsg2k3.AERO.BALL.COM>

I am having problems porting my (working) Windows based application to
Linux.  It is most likely something I am doing wrong in the Makefile.

 

Right up front I will admit I am very rusty on Linux.  It has been
several years since I have used it regularly and then I explicitly
linked dot a files rather than dot so files.

 

I first tried to build GDAL from the current tarball and did get
libraries out of it but it kept looking for SQL files so I downloaded
the FWTools-linux-0.9.4.tar.gz file.  I do not have root access to the
system so I unpacked the tar file and put all of the files from the lib
directory in a directory in my LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

 

I have libgdal.so in my makefile library path but I get several link
(undefined reference) errors on various GDAL and OGR member functions
such as GDALRasterBand::GetRasterDataType and OGRPoint::OGRPoint.  I
believe the linker is finding the library ok because if I take
libgdal.so out of the make file I get eve more errors such as GDALOpen.

 

As I recall we used to have to run ranlib on dot a files when they did
this kind of thing but that doesn't apply to dot so files does it?
Besides that since I am using the precompiled libraries it seems like
they should already be up to date.

 

I know this is likely some dumb thing I am not doing but I don't see
what.

 

Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

 

Bruce

Bruce,

It would be helpful if you included the command you are attempting to 
execute, the stdout and stderr it is producing, your platform specifics, 
(i.e., OS vender, kernel rev. & system architecture), and your compiler 
(version).

You don't need root access to build gdal, just execute permission to the 
compiler, (make tools, preprocessor), read access to shared libraries 
and headers, and write access to some place (i.e., your home directory) 
where you can compile (and ultimately execute) your binaries. However, I 
am confused as to what you're trying to do. Are you attempting to link 
GDAL to an application you wrote, or some other (perhaps common) 
application? I'm also confused by your statement, "it kept looking for 
SQL files."

Lorenzo,
   I have not built GDAL with MrSID but several MrSID Decode SDK users have had problems like this when try to make SOs and dynlibs.  DSDK archive has some object files that should not be in there and linker is not pruning them out.  Could you send me the link line?

After you installed the MrSID SDK, did you run "ranlib" on the MrSID
library ? MacOS X has the annoying "feature" that the linker will refuse
to link libraries whose last file modification date is newer than the
last time it's archive directory was updated. This means that if you
copy a library to a different location, you must then run "ranlib" on
it.

With kind regards,
Eric

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Bug on gdal hdf format webpage?
Message-ID: <200412231127.06480.vincent@ecovla.nl>

Hi all,

the gdal webpage about the hdf format 
(http://www.remotesensing.org/gdal/frmt_hdf4.html) says you don't need to 
recompile gdal when you change the MAX_FILE setting in hdf's hlimits.h and 
recompile the hdflib. However, my experience is different: the change in the 
max number of open files of the hdf driver in gdal only changes after 
recompiling gdal too. Which probably makes sense because the hdf lib is 
linked statically into gdal, and not dynamically?

Am I the only one experiencing this behaviour, or is it a bug on the webpage?

I'm on an amd64 gentoo linux system, using the hdf library from gentoo 
(4.2.0-r3) and the latest gdal from cvs.

Regards,
Vincent.

Hi all

After many tests I have discovered a conflict between JASPER lib and MrSID lib.
The error is linked to this conflict.

in configure you must enter

....
--with-jasper=no \
--with-mrsid=/src/Geo_DSDK-4.0.9.713 \
....

and mrsid is built with gdal in Mac OS X.


Bye

Vincent, 

I suspect this is a difference in build situations.  The web page seems to 
have been written under the assumption that folks are using HDF shared
libraries as opposed to static libraries.  I have changed the text to read:

   If you need open more HDF4 files simultaneously you should change 
   this value and rebuild HDF4 library (and relink GDAL if using static HDF
   libraries).

Hopefully this will be clearer.  Of course, any information about external
libraries and builds tends to be suspect since there are so many ways
people can build things.  Software builders end up having to be pretty
self-reliant. 

Best regards,

Message-ID: <ED3A48B9840E594890A2BC172D119465020DC34D@mailman.san.com>

Hi All,

I am trying to use OGR to access a rather large (~90M) shape file with about 215,000 polygons. I am using a spatial filter in my execute call.  The result set is about 3,000 objects but it takes about 20 seconds to execute on a pretty fast machine.  Does OGR use the index file for this query? Is there something else that I can do to speed this up?

Thanks a lot,

Rostic

Hi,

There are plans to use the Mapserver type of quadtree index for shapefiles
(file extension qix) in OGR, but AFAIK this has not yet been incorporated
into OGR.

Best regards,
Bart

Swan Dream,

I don't know if I responded to this already privately.  But the answer is that
I am not making any effort to maintain a project file for GDAL.  You could
prepare one yourself, but I think it would be a significant effort since the
source is spread over so many directories, and since there are files in some
directories which must not be compiled in (test mainlines for instance).

What I would suggest is that you rebuild using the NMAKE files, but with
debug enabled (comment out the default OPTFLAGS and uncomment the one with
/Zi).  The build will then produce a gdal.pdb.  If you put that whereever
you put the gdal12.dll you should find you have debug info available in
visual studio.  You may need to point the debugger to the source files if it
doesn't know where they are.

Jochen,

There is no supported C# wrapper; however, I believe if you search back in the
gdal-dev list you will find an example I passed on from another GDAL user.

In fact, I think this message is what I am thinking of:

Piero,

I don't know why this is happening.  Any possibility that you have include
files for a very antique version of GDAL somewhere on your system?  The build
is supposed to use local versions of the include files in preference to system
versions, but this can occationally get messed up.

If that isn't the case, then you will likely need to dig through it carefully
yourself.

Rostic,

OGR (and Shapelib) do not currently take advantage of any kind of spatial
index for shapefiles.  The ESRI supported version of the spatial index is
not documented, and I haven't worked out the format.  I have been working
on adding support for MapServer style spatial indexes in the shapefile driver
but that works is still sitting half-finished in my local source tree (as it
has for a month or two) so I don't know when it will be available.

I'm afraid there is not direct way of doing fast spatial queries with OGR
on shapefiles at this time. OGR does support fast spatial searching for some
formats such as MapInfo binary files, and most of the spatial RDBMS environments.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Thin Plate Spline Warper
Message-ID: <931f8ea9041230133374b36b8b@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

For some time people have noted that the GDAL polynomial image 
warper does not perform well for some images.  For instance long
AVHRR swaths. 

With code provided by VISRT Inc, and the financial support of the
Centro di Ecologia Alpina I have been able to incorporate a thin plate
spline warper into GDAL.  While I am still doing some testing, it seems
to be performing very well.  This transformer transforms exactly at all
ground control points provided, and between control points gives 
smooth (continuous) results with greatest weight given to nearby 
control points.  

The new thin plate spline warper can be used with gdalwarp by 
providing the -tps commandline switch.  It can be invoked
programatically using an order of -1 with GDALCreateGenImgProjTransformer
or more directly by invoking GDALCreateTPSTransformer(). 

I would encourage people to try it out from nightly snapshots of
GDAL (or from CVS).  Let me know if you run into problems. 

Also, while in working on transformers I have altered the way that
transformers work a bit with the intention of making the serialization
of warper information to XML work properly.  Previously it was broken
on win32 platforms due to problems comparing function pointers in win32
DLL builds.  That should all be resolved now.

Best regards,
