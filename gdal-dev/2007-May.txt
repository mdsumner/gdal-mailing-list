Frank,

I realize that we are talking about a different application and different
user-interface. You want to load a FileSectionDialog so it must be fast and
it must show the list at once. I was talking about running the file-browser
in a separate tread so that the UI could be update while the query is been
made. I guess that the fast format identification will be a plus in both
cases. 

Anyway, I always felt that the drivers open method is doing more than it
should, so separating Identify() from Open() is a good refactorying idea. 

You can add RST in your list and I will take care of it.

Regards,

Ivan

Ivan,

I don't see that multi-threading is a great solution to speeding up
identification, and if it is, it should provide even more benefit
once the identify operation is available.

Keeping some sort of search index might work in some contexts, but at
a great cost in complication and there would still be the brutal hit the
first time a big directory on a network drive is accessed.

I quite agree that the identify feature is not *critical* for folks to
build applications with GDAL.  But there is an important client who wants
it to improve their user experience, and I can see it being useful for other
applications, so I'm keen to provide a solution.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <4637054C.9030805@openplans.org>

Hi,
today I tried to build gdal again with VC6 to find it does not
build anymore due to changes in the Integraph module:

Stop.

I also tried going on with mingw, which compiles fine gdal and ogr,
but then starts complaining in the swig binding directory about
issues I don't remember about with the java OGR bindings.
I also tried building a swig version specific for MinGW, as suggested
on the SWIG site, but failed because of autoconf issues...
the msys and mingw guys do not seem to be getting along very well 
apparently, there are two autoconf versions around, one distributed 
along with mingw, that does not work out of the box because I miss
perl, which is distributed with the msysdtk.... which installs its own
version of autoconf and automake too.

Oh well, I had enough for today. If I have some half a day to throw
away next weekend I'll try again the visual c++ express path (which
I have to reinstall from scratch, find the right windows SDK, the
right incantations to pacth atl, and so on... would be nice to have
a guide).

Cheers
Andrea

I've used a swig for windows binary distribution from msys shell and 
that has worked well.

I've never got autoconf working in msys.

I haven't found a perl that works in msys at all. The perl I use in 
Windows I build myself with dmake and mingw in a plain windows command 
prompt. It does not work in msys shell.

I should try to build the perl bindings in windows with ActiveState perl 
and the GDAL-devel package Frank put out, but haven't got into really 
trying.

Ari

With regard to rewriting that page, balancing detail which will confuse

twice right now, which may have contributed to Maciej's original 
confusion. How about simply removing the second instance under "Creation

Anyway, I'd vote for more documentation against less, if that's not too

I had built and installed gdal 1.3 on a linux computer, and recently
did a build and install of 1.4 on the same computer. Daniel Morissette
suggested that that might be the cause of some anomalies I am

uninstalled gdal 1.3 prior to installing 1.4, and if so, how should
that be done?

Rich,

There is no mechanism to uninstall GDAL.  If you install them in the
same place (ie. /usr/local) the last installed will normally take precidence
over older installs.  Problems with duplication are usually most ugly when
you have copies of GDAL in different places. Such as one in /usr/lib and
on in /usr/local/lib.  Then it is easy to have a case where you build against
one set of include files, but end up picking up a different libgdal.so at
runtime.

	to ECW
Message-ID: <25BE68A4D83DD4438F701DF0311F3F4A4019B9@posthus.blominfo.dk>

Dear list,

While experimenting with compression of vrt-files, I've run into the
following error:

D:\tmp>gdal_translate -of ECW --config ECW_LARGE_OK YES -co TARGET=90
-co DATUM=WGS84 -co PROJ=NUTM32 mosaic.vrt mosaic.ecw
Input file size is 263092, 246181
0..ERROR 1: An error has occurred: Error 46 "Could not allocate enough

file "" line 0
ERROR 1: IReadBlock failed at X offset 0, Y offset 15825
ERROR 1: GetBlockRef failed at X block offset 0, Y block offset 15825
100 - done.

As far as I can see, there is lots of available memory when the error
occurs. If I add something like "-outsize 10% 10%" to the command above
everything works as expected.

The VRT consists of ECW files which together forms an irregular shaped
mosaic. 

I'm on windows using "GDAL 1.4.0.0, FWTools 1.2.3, released 2007/02/22".

Looking in the archives I was only able to find one similar post
(http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2005-August/006264.html)
which apparently didn't get any replies.

Any hints?

Best regards
Asger

Asger,

If you can file a bug sufficient for us to reproduce this, I could have
Mateusz do some digging.  But it seems like the problems is deep in the
ECW SDK and it likely to be very hard for us to ferret out.

Hi List,
I really don't know if I'm going about this in the right way as I have
virtually no experience building python modules but what I'm trying to
do is build a python 2.5 gdal module. So I've installed python 2.5 for
windows. I've downloaded gdal and unzipped it and that's about as far as
I've got. I notice that there is a swig/python directory so I run
D:\gdal\gdal-1.4.1\swig\python>python setup.py build -c mingw32
But then get errors:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "setup.py", line 70, in <module>
    raise IOError, '%s. %s' % (e, "Has GDAL been made?")
IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '../setup.ini'. Has GDAL
been made
?

I have tried to understand the documentation but it seems to refer to
using other compilers. I think I have to use mingw32 because of the
python version. I hope this make sense and I would be really grateful if
any one could give me some help.

Hi list,

I have built gdal with HDF4 HDF5 and szip on Windows XP before.
1) download pre-compiled binary versions of external libraries 
2) change fields such as: GDAL_HOME, HDF4_DIR, HDF5_DIR, SZIP_DIR in
nmake.opt file

I am building gdal with HDF and szip on Linux.
Here are the questions:
1) nmake.opt file has 
	# Uncomment the following and update to enable NCSA HDF Release
4 support.
	HDF4_DIR =	C:\build161\gdal\Libs\HDF41r5
	HDF4_LIB =	/LIBPATH:$(HDF4_DIR)\lib Ws2_32.lib
Ws2_32.lib is a Windows library.  What Do I do with it in Linux?

2) Has anyone downloaded pre-compiled binary versions from
ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/ or you downloaded src and compiled yourself?
Where do you put the downloaded and/or the compiled files?

I'll appreciate if you can share your experience with building gdal with
HDF4 HDF5 and szip on Linux.

Thanks,
Shawn

I would like to raise this issue again.

I have tried to solve the problem with downsampling using gdalwarp. I
have implemented filtered resampling and now -rcs option should work much
better. Please, try the new implementation of cubic spline filter (-rcs)
and Lanczos filter (-r lanczos) for both upsampling and downsampling
cases. Note, that new implementation works slower than the old one,
though there is a room for optimization. Nearest neighbour, bilinear and
cubic convolution scalers did not changed yet.

Updated implementation is available from the SVN HEAD. I am waiting for
feedback, so all parties interested in better scaling during warping are
welcome to test.

Best regards,
Andrey

Shawn,

I don't have anything concrete to offer, though I'm pretty sure I've
at least once used downloaded hdf binaries on linux.  But them I feel
pretty confident hacking on the GDALmake.opt after configuration to get
what I want.

I mostly just wanted to encourage folks to update the HDF building wiki
topic with details:

This is why I usually build gdal with --prefix=/opt/... so that every 
gdal file goes into that directory. Later I can just delete that 
directory to uninstall. As for apps using gdal you can either point them 
to specific version using --with-gdal or similar, or create links in 
/usr/local. Because each link will point to /opt/... it is easy to 
identify and remove them using find.

To create links:
lndir -ignorelinks /opt/gdal-cvs20061215_p4_linux /usr/local

To remove links:
find /usr/local -lname '/opt/gdal-cvs20061215_p4_linux*' -exec 'rm' '{}' ';'

Subject: [Gdal-dev] GDALWarpOptions padfSrcNoDataImag
Message-ID: <009c01c78cec$8fd15660$7401a8c0@sherpa>

I'm getting an exception in GDALWarpOperation when I initialize with my warp
options.  The exception is getting thrown when Initialize verifies that
padfSrcNoDataImag[0] isn't 0 since padfSrcNoDataImag is NULL.  I can of
course tweak gdal to check for a NULL pointer instead of looking for 0 in
the 0 index, but without digging further I'm not 100% that is ok.  I've
processed several hundred files with my code the way it is, and it is only
this new image that is giving me fits so I thought I'd first try and
determine what the padfSrcNoDataImag option is.  With a cursory look at the
docs I haven't been able to find a description of how/why this gets set.
Any suggestions?

Code snippet follows sig.

Thanks,

checkinstall (instead of "make install") is a convenient tool for
managing home grown packages. It catches what "make install" (or any
other specified install command) would do and creates a deb out of it
(or rpm, Slackware packages) instead. You can then install/remove the
package as you like.

I handle all my self-built software with checkinstall and no probs,
besides the new python bindings in GDAL, which checkinstall fails to
include into the package. If GDAL is built with old bindings though,
checkinstall builds the package fine.

I'd recommend using checkinstall 1.6.0 over older versions, and
definitely not recommend the newest 1.6.1, which has a nasty bug that
"package has unrelated files inside" [1]. 1.6.0 is the best release so
far, IMHO.

Not a significant change, but just so you all know that this is coming: 
in the next few weeks (days) I am going to convert MapServer to use the 
OGR C API instead of the C++ classes. To do this I will likely need to 
add new OGR C API methods to handle style stuff, this should go in 1.5.0.

Should I prepare a RFC for that?

Hi Joanne,

People have reported it is possible to get gdal working with python 
newer than 2.3, but the road is generally rough and circuitous. Search 
the archives for previous threads on this:
http://www.nabble.com/GDAL---Dev-f1192.html

The easiest method to get a python-enabled gdal is to install FWTools: 
http://fwtools.maptools.org/

cheers,

Craig,

I don't know why this would only affect one image out of many similar ones.
But I do think this code in Initialize() should not assume padfSrcNoDataImag
is non-NULL just because padfSrcNoDataReal is non-NULL

             if( hSrcBand != NULL
                 && psOptions->padfSrcNoDataReal != NULL )
             {
                 int bMergeSource = FALSE;

                 if( psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag[iBand] != 0.0
                     && !GDALDataTypeIsComplex( psOptions->eWorkingDataType ) )
                     bMergeSource = TRUE;

Could you file a bug on this, and I'll fix it in trunk and 1.4 branch.  I
think the fix would be to change:

                 if( psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag[iBand] != 0.0
                     && !GDALDataTypeIsComplex( psOptions->eWorkingDataType ) )
                     bMergeSource = TRUE;

to:
                 if( psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag != NULL
                     && psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag[iBand] != 0.0
                     && !GDALDataTypeIsComplex( psOptions->eWorkingDataType ) )
                     bMergeSource = TRUE;

Message-ID: <46392817.5050705@pobox.com>

Folks,

OSGeo is finally bringing the Service Provider Directory online.  It is
essentially a web list of consultants and service organizations in the open
source geospatial realm.  We are currently seeking consultants and service
organizations to register themselves in the directory.  In a few weeks,
assuming this goes fairly well, we will start trying to publicize the
directory to potential clients, and work it into our presentations, materials
at conferences and so forth.

There is no cost to participate.  You just need someone in your organization
to register for an OSGeo Userid, then login into the OSGeo web site, and then
go to the form to enter your organization details.  There are some directions
and discussion at:

   http://www.osgeo.org/spd_help

Feel free to contact me, if you have questions about this service provider
directory.  We anticipate some fine tuning before we promote it vigorously.

Thank you both for your very helpful advise. My case proved to be
fairly simple and I was able to revert back from 1.4 to 1.3, but I ca
see that some foresight when installing could be very beneficial!

What is the minus sign i front of the Y res for???

What is the UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433]], factor in this output?? can
I use it to define the resolution?? Or what is it needed for??

Final question,

Is there a stright forward way of changing the image's resolution so as to
have a quadratic one whereby resX=resY ????

Any suggestions? help?

Thanks in advance

Mattia,

That is correct.

It means that as you step "down" the image from the top left corner you
subtract 1000m per pixel step from the y coordinate.  This is normal.

This indicates that one degree on the underlying geographic
coordinate system is 0.017... radians.  It is standard and does
not help you for what you want to do.

I didn't follow that I'm afraid.  Are you just wanting to resample
your image to have square pixels?  You could do something like:

gdalwarp -rb -ps 694 694 Area1.tif Area1SquarePixels.tif

This would use a bilinear resampling kernel to convert your
image from 694x1000 meter pixels to 694x694 meter pixels.

Hi,
I have a number of xyz files that need to be converted into standard formats. I have found a message[1] by Uli M?ller with a nice AWK script that I have modified to suit my evil needs :) I can easily follow the same logic to write a python script, but I before I go down that route (I'll probably need an standalong application, so using awk is cumbersome), I was wondering whether there are any other ways of solving this problem. Data are x,y,z (z values at the edges of pixels), but could also be x,y,z_center (z values at the center of the pixel).

Cheers!

Thanks, the new link worked fine...

I've compiled on Windows the GRIB driver along with the latest svn 
snapshot of GDAL.
When I try to load sample GRIB data, I get this:

Warning/Error: 6: Failed to initialize PROJ.4 with `+proj=lcc +lat_1=0 
+lat_2=0 +lat_0=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6371200 +b=6371200 +units=m 
+no_defs '.

Then the resulting image seems not to have correct/valid values.

Any hints on what this warrning/error could be related to?
Anyone successfully using the GRIB driver on Windows?

Thanks for any help/advice...
Kind regards,

Message-ID: <9c2015090705031040n13f67323pd2cb5b233afb4e52@mail.gmail.com>

I'm having problems with the GDAL installation I have running in Cygwin on
Windows XP.  It appears that GDAL is unable to find some of the proj
libraries that it needs.  I ran the following command:
gdalwarp -s_srs "EPSG:32651" -t_srs "EPSG:4326" input.tif output.tif

it gave this error when it ran:

ERROR 6: Unable to load PROJ.4 library (libproj.dll), creation of
OGRCoordinateTransformation failed.

I did a search and found posts saying that I should download and install
proj from source, then compile GDAL with static linking to proj using the
"--with-static-proj4" configure flag.  I downloaded and installed
proj-4.5.0from source yesterday, but am unsure what path to give the
"--with-static-proj" option.

Can someone give me a few pointers about what I should look for?

Thanks,

Roger

Yes, what I need is to "resize" the pixel. Being the image taken from the
satellite, it skews the far away pixels, mainly ones towards the edges of
the bounding box. I need to execute a bow-tie correction, then somehow
"compress" the pixels to a square resolution. Does that sound feasable? I
will try the command.

Cheers

Hi Andrey,

This is timely. I just this morning find myself looking for a better 
quality upsampling process. In my exploration I found a bug with 
-rcs[1], hopefully your recent work fixes it! I'll have to wait for a 
binary windows build to find out as my linux machine is currently broken.

[1] http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1610

Can you (or anyone) direct me to a page which discusses the various 
resampling algorithms and for which image types and processes they are 
most suited to?

thanks,

Roger,

If your proj4 DLL has another name use the command

set PROJSO=<name of the proj4 DLL>

in the DOS prompt (if that's appropriate in Cygwin) and add the 
directory in which the DLL is into the path. You can get pre-compiled 
proj4 DLL from several sources FWTools for example.

Regards,

Ari

This is probably happens because GDAL can't find PROJ.4 (proj.dll).
You can get that from:

http://www.remotesensing.org/proj/

There are prebuilt binaries for win32 ready to go.

Hi Ari,

I tried using the dll from FWTools.  I installed the Windows version of
FWTools 1.2.2 and then found the proj_fw.dll file in the "bin/" dir.  I
first followed your instructions and tried using the set command:
set PROJSO=/cygdrive/c/FWTools1.2.2/bin/proj_fw.dll

This did not set the enviroment variable, but I went ahead and tested it and
got the same error as before.

I then edited the /etc/profile dir in Cygwin and added the following entry:
PROJSO=/cygdrive/c/FWTools1.2.2/bin/proj_fw.dll

After sourcing /etc/profile the environment variable appeared to be
correctly set.  I then tested the gdalwarp, and again got the same error.

I had a similar problem initially getting Python support in the gdal
compile.  This was resolved with Norman's help by setting the
"--with-python" configure option.  It seems like there is a definite "issue"
that requires static libraries to be built when using GDAL and PROJ in
Cygwin.  I'm totally fine with that, but I'm lost regarding how to set my
compile parameters.  My guess is that the workflow should go something like
this:

- Install Cygwin
- install PROJ from source and set flags to create PROJ libraries (if
needed)
- install GDAL from source and set flags to statically link to Python, PROJ,
POSTGIS, etc

If that's the case, then the question becomes how to determine what the
correct path is to those various libraries?  I know this is dependent on the
install location, but isn't there a default path?

Thanks,

Roger

I think PROJSO should be set to just "proj_fw.dll" in your case. That's 
because GDAL uses a system call for loading a dll with its name. The 
system then looks through the usual places, which you have told it using 
PATH. Is /cygdrive/c/FWTools1.2.2/bin/ in your PATH?

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Trouble linking GDAL library and Matlab
Message-ID: <ddc797c30705040212j2c80b403y1bb3f1b9fd1a33d1@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Matlab offers the possibility to compile C programs and use them as matlab
functions. This is called Mex files and works almost like making a dll. I
used Visual Studio 2005 Pro and FWTools 1.2.1 in order to be able to use
GDAL inside Matlab.

The simple C program I made is below and just take a string in input and
returns 1.

---------------------------------Start
Code-----------------------------------------
#include "gdal_priv.h"
#include "mex.h"

void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[],
                 int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[])
{

    double *y;
    char *pszFilename;
    int bufLen;
    int status;

    /* Create a 1-by-1 matrix for the return argument. */
    plhs[0] = mxCreateDoubleMatrix(1, 1, mxREAL);

    /* Input must be a string. */
    if (mxIsChar(prhs[0]) != 1)
        mexErrMsgTxt("Input must be a string.");

    /* Input must be a row vector. */
    if (mxGetM(prhs[0]) != 1)
        mexErrMsgTxt("Input must be a row vector");

    /* Get the length of the input string. */
    bufLen = (mxGetM(prhs[0]) * mxGetN(prhs[0])) + 1;

    /* Allocate memory for input string. */
    pszFilename = (char *) mxCalloc(bufLen, sizeof(char));

    /* Copy string data from prhs[0] into a C string inputBuf. */
    status = mxGetString(prhs[0], pszFilename, bufLen);
    if (status != 0)
        mexWarnMsgTxt("Not enough space. String is truncated.");

    /*GDALDataset  *poDataset;

    GDALAllRegister();*/

    /*poDataset = (GDALDataset *) GDALOpen( pszFilename, GA_ReadOnly );
    if( poDataset == NULL ) {
    } else {
        mexWarnMsgTxt("Could not open dataset.");
    }*/

    /* Assign a pointer to the output. */
    y = mxGetPr(plhs[0]);

    *y = 1.0;
}
--------------------------------------------End
Code-------------------------------------

Without #include "gdal_priv.h" everything is fine, but with there is a
problem of dependency (Matlab cannot find some library) althought all gdal
(all found in FWTools\bin) dlls are in path (checked with depends walker).
Discussion with Matlab support identified the problem in "gdal_priv.h" line
56 #include <vector>. AFAIK, <vector> is a STL standard C++ library.
Did I missed something ? linking with some special library ?

Thanks for your help.
Guillaume.

Message-ID: <2DBB9F887DAA394FA75D98474EA5730D03721361@vader.prologic-inc.com>

All,

I've been looking at the C# bindings to see if we can use them in our
project and I noticed that there seems to be a memory leak when using
the SpatialReference class.  I'm not sure this same problem exists
elsewhere, but it is something to look into.

Running the following simple loop makes memory go through the roof even
though Dispose is being called 
for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; ++i)
{
  using (SpatialReference dst = new SpatialReference(""))
  {
    //Do something with SpatialReference
  }
}

I looked through the bindings quickly this morning and didn't see
anything glaringly obvious, should I file a ticket for this problem?

Thanks!

Jason

I yet have another Geotiff for which I get a pixel size of about 0.0323 for
both the X and Y directions...

As I gather the units used are degrees... How do I convert from these to
knowing how many meters per pixel are represented by my image??

I need meters/pixel

Any suggestions

Cheers

Daniel,

I'm sure that proj.dll exists (and it is from the latest PROJ version, 
4.5.0).

I did a simple test with gdalinfo against a sample GRIB file.
Note that running gdalinfo against the same data does not report any 
errors on Linux and on Mac OS X.
On Windows I get:

ERROR 6: Failed to initialize PROJ.4 with `+proj=lcc +lat_1=0 +lat_2=0 
+lat_0=0 +lon_0=0 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +a=6371200 +b=6371200 +units=m +no_defs '.

Sorry for the bad form of replying to my own message, but would it also
be possible to expose the array based coordinate transformation methods
that convert many locations with a single method call?

Thanks!

Mattia -

Generally, no, it?s not doable, at least not while maintaining unprojected
data.  A degree of latitude and a degree of longitude are not the same size,
and their sizes vary depending on where on the Earth they are located.  One
degree of longitude is a different size (in meters) at the northern edge of
your image than it is on the southern edge.

If you need to measure in meters you should project your image from
geographic coordinates to a projected coordinate system.  Your image covers
a fairly large area so you should think carefully about what projection is
best for your needs.

Or you could revisit your requirement; why you need an image with units in
meters?

Guillaume,

Why do you include gdal_priv.h?
In my mexs I always include only gdal.h.

In case you are interested my package, Mirone, has a gdalread and a 
gdalwrite mex file.
I also have a gdalwarp mex but it is not released yet. It is waiting for 
bug 1393
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1393
to be corrected

Mirone is here
w3.ualg.pt/~jluis/mirone

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Question about reprojecting a Shapefile
Message-ID: <20ecc0f10705041354t5b521fc1vbb9699109e0f9b94@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've been using GDAL for some time, but am fairly new at using OGR.
I've started by trying to reproject a shapefile from geographic
coordinates into another coordinate system (LCC) using ogr2ogr and
when I look at the output it looks like the .prj file is incomplete
(missing datum) and the features are in the wrong locations.  What am
I missing?  I've read through the archives, but I didn't see anything
like this mentioned.

My command line looks like:
ogr2ogr -overwrite -f  "ESRI Shapefile" -t_srs "+ellps=WGS84 +proj=lcc
+lon_0=-82.85w +lat_0=40.39n +lat_1=39.39n +lat_2=41.39n"
"c:\images\output.shp" "c:\images\input.shp"

The original .prj:
GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_WGS_1984",SPHEROID["WGS_1984",6378137.0,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]]

The resulting .prj:
PROJCS["Lambert_Conformal_Conic",GEOGCS["GCS_WGS_1984",DATUM["D_unknown",SPHEROID["WGS84",6378137,298.257223563]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic"],PARAMETER["standard_parallel_1",39.39],PARAMETER["standard_parallel_2",41.39],PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",40.39],PARAMETER["central_meridian",-82.85],PARAMETER["false_easting",0],PARAMETER["false_northing",0],UNIT["Meter",1]]

Thanks,
Luke

Message-ID: <744815.42635.qm@web31801.mail.mud.yahoo.com>

Hello all,
I am getting incorrect results when I use gdalwarp and cannot figure out what I am doing wrong. The warping looks perfect, but the coords embedded in the resulting geotiff are shifted south so the resulting image does not show up correctly when overlayed on a map. I tried with other programs and did not have the same problem, I would rather use gdal because of the great interpolation capabilities.

The command I am using is:

gdalwarp.exe -rc -s_srs "+proj=latlong +datum=WGS84" -t_srs "+proj=ortho +datum=WGS84 +lon_0=11.618610 +lat_0=56.154163" -co INTERLEAVE=PIXEL Denmark.InitialCrop.tif Denmark.Warped.tif

I have placed the image I am trying to warp and the resulting file here:

http://ecovagabond.com/gis/Denmark.InitialCrop.tif 
http://ecovagabond.com/gis/Denmark.Warped.Gdal.tif 

In case this is helpful I am also including below the results of running gdalinfo on both files.
I am using a freshly installed version of FWTools1.3.0 on a WindowsXP machine.
The initial file was created by running gdal_translate on an image of the world.
Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you,

Jason,

I've applied the fix for the memory leak problem in the SVN trunk and
branch 1.4. Would you mind making your test using the latest SVN
version?

Best regards,

Message-ID: <3054411AF4728548AD6D7137190D56B30C462A@admin1.aeromap.com>

Guillaume,

I did switch to cpp and was able to create .mexs32 file as well as .dll dynamically linked to gdal.
Steps you could try:
1. rename file to test.cpp;
2. load libs in the header:
#include "mex.h"
#include "C:\my_Projects\packages\gdal-1.4.0\distrib\include\gdal_priv.h"
#pragma comment (lib,"gdal_i-vc8.lib") // dynamic link
#pragma comment (lib,"libmex.lib") // static link (for mexErrMsgTxt)
3. copy both libs to test.cpp folder;
4. matlab: "mex test.cpp" or "mcc -v -B cpplib:testlib test.cpp"

My environment: msvc8.0+gdal1.4.0

Happy programming!
gok

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Trouble linking GDAL library and Matlab


Hello,

Matlab offers the possibility to compile C programs and use them as matlab functions. This is called Mex files and works almost like making a dll. I used Visual Studio 2005 Pro and FWTools 1.2.1 in order to be able to use GDAL inside Matlab. 

The simple C program I made is below and just take a string in input and returns 1.

---------------------------------Start Code-----------------------------------------
#include "gdal_priv.h"
#include "mex.h"

void mexFunction(int nlhs, mxArray *plhs[],
                 int nrhs, const mxArray *prhs[])
{

    double *y;
    char *pszFilename;
    int bufLen;
    int status; 

    /* Create a 1-by-1 matrix for the return argument. */
    plhs[0] = mxCreateDoubleMatrix(1, 1, mxREAL);

    /* Input must be a string. */
    if (mxIsChar(prhs[0]) != 1)
        mexErrMsgTxt("Input must be a string."); 

    /* Input must be a row vector. */
    if (mxGetM(prhs[0]) != 1)
        mexErrMsgTxt("Input must be a row vector");

    /* Get the length of the input string. */
    bufLen = (mxGetM(prhs[0]) * mxGetN(prhs[0])) + 1; 

    /* Allocate memory for input string. */
    pszFilename = (char *) mxCalloc(bufLen, sizeof(char));

    /* Copy string data from prhs[0] into a C string inputBuf. */
    status = mxGetString(prhs[0], pszFilename, bufLen); 
    if (status != 0)
        mexWarnMsgTxt("Not enough space. String is truncated.");

    /*GDALDataset  *poDataset;

    GDALAllRegister();*/

    /*poDataset = (GDALDataset *) GDALOpen( pszFilename, GA_ReadOnly ); 
    if( poDataset == NULL ) {
    } else {
        mexWarnMsgTxt("Could not open dataset.");
    }*/

    /* Assign a pointer to the output. */
    y = mxGetPr(plhs[0]);

    *y = 1.0 ;
}
--------------------------------------------End Code-------------------------------------

Without #include "gdal_priv.h" everything is fine, but with there is a problem of dependency (Matlab cannot find some library) althought all gdal (all found in FWTools\bin) dlls are in path (checked with depends walker). 
Discussion with Matlab support identified the problem in "gdal_priv.h" line 56 #include <vector>. AFAIK, <vector> is a STL standard C++ library.
Did I missed something ? linking with some special library ? 

Thanks for your help.
Guillaume.

Luke,

Try this with +datum=WGS84 instead of +ellps=WGS84 for
the target srs.  I believe this will fix the problem.  Stating
the ellipse is a lot less specific than stating the datum.

Do "epsg_tr.py 32618" and compare.

I downloaded a GRIB file from

http://www.nws.noaa.gov/mdl/NDFD_GRIB2Decoder/custmgrd.php

using the default values in the form. I got an error reading that
file, "ERROR 1: latitude or longitude exceeded limits". It's not the
same error as you got but the file is in a Lambert projection just as
yours and i found a bug in the gridtemplate definition file. I'm not
sure if this is related to your problem especially since it seems to
work on Linux in your case.

There seams to be a minus sign missing in the definition of Lambert in
gridtemplates.h The 11:th element in the array should be -4 i think
instead of 4 to indicate that it can have a sign.

   // 3.30: Lambert Conformal
        {30, 22, 0, {1,1,4,1,4,1,4,4,4,-4,-4,1,-4,4,4,4,1,1,-4,-4,-4,4} },

Hi all,

I downloaded the gdal-1.4.0 tarball and copied nearblack.cpp and the 
GNUmakefile changes needed for it. I can compile it but the executable 
is a libtool shell script. How can I get an executable that I can run in 
gdb?

I assume I can "make install" it but I don't want to do that until I 
have tested and debugged it.

Message-ID: <0F9491E3-9747-43EA-B7B9-9907D0B842CC@pricepages.org>

I'm trying to distribute gdalwarp as cluster jobs. This involves  
copying gdal and it's libraries to remote machines, running the  
commands, and returning the output. I'm having trouble with gdalwarp;  
the '-rcs' flag isn't taking effect for some reason.

No error is being returned and it's taking the appropriate amount of  
time for the 'nearest' algorithm. The exact command will look like this:
./gdalwarp -t_srs '+proj=merc +datum=WGS84 +units=m' -ts 11651 34151 - 
wm 200 -co 'TILED=YES' -co 'BLOCKXSIZE=512' -co 'BLOCKYSIZE=512' -rcs  
'./N072W180_x1.tif' 'out.tif'

When I tried running this command outside of its wrapper program, it  
worked as expected.

Does anyone have any idea what could cause the sampling method to  
default? I've browsed the source code, and nothing stands out as a  
potential problem. Were there any recent bugs fixed that may be  
related? Do any environment variables need to be set?

I'm using a recent CVS of GDAL, because 1.4.1 wouldn't compile. I'm  
on a Mac.
Thanks,
Seth

Steve,

First, keep in mind you need to set the CFG environment variable to
"debug" to get GDAL to build with debug info (ie. add -g to cflags).

Second, you can do "gdb .libs/nearblack" to use the actual executable
with the debugger.

Third, you can instead configure using --without-libtool and build
to avoid the libtool indirection shell scripts.

Message-ID: <fa2ac0580705060449g4560cd8r2b3139c3971d4e6e@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is their a way to convert just the pure black pixels (0,0,0) around the
interior of a tile to 0,0,1?

I believe the solution is to first convert all the pure black pixels(0,0,0)
within a tile to 0,0,1 by remapping within gdalwarp

-srcnodata 0,0,0 -dstnodata 0,0,1

and then run nearblack to convert all the 0,0,1 values around the collar
back to pure black.  That way the interior black values stay at 0,0,1 so
later when the tiles are mocaicked via gdalwarp the only pixels that are
0,0,0 are around the collars of the tiles and the void/empty areas that the
mosaics creates, which can made invisible within mapserver via offsite
0,0,0.

Does this make sense and if all I want to do is convert the 0,0,1 values to
0,0,0 within near black then should I make the near black parameter (-near
1) instead of the default of value of 15?

Thanks,**

Sorry, I'll comment here. This is from point of view of Perl bindings.

You are using typemap "double argout[ANY]" which seems to require that 
you know the ANY beforehand. The same typemap is implicitly used 
elsewhere in GCPsToGeoTransform where ANY is 6.

This case seems to require a malloc, a copy to the malloced array, and 
after the call a copy to a new Perl array, and  freeing of the malloced 
array.

I need to at least define a new typemap and that seems to mean that I 
can't use "double argout[ANY]". The new typemap could be something like 
"double *inout", but I don't know how the nCount gets set (and there are 
possibly three values for it since there are three input arrays). I'd be 
inclined to use something like "int, double *, double *, double *" 
typemap since this kind of data is easiest to keep in one 2D array in Perl.

At this point, however, I'd like to postpone implementing this method in 
the Perl bindings.

Regards,

Ari

I just replied to Tamas' mail and for the time being it would perhaps be 
best to exclude the new method from the Perl bindings.

Ok, I've recognized lately that I was a bit indulged by the C# default
marshaler which handles this kind of allocation internally so the C#
typemaps doesn't rely on the $dim0 substitution.

Now, I've made the explicit %apply typemap redirection internal to C#
so anyone can implement this new typemap for the other languages
anytime in the future.

To avoid a number of unnecessary memory copy I'll continue to suggest the
(int nCount, double *x, double *y, double *z)  signature of this
function. One can possibly implement this new typemap by replacing
$dim0 with nCount in the typemap implementation to achieve the desired
results. I guess we can agree in using  the nCount name every time
when this typemap will come into the picture.

Best regards,

Tamas

This is a call for discussion on a new RFC intended to make it easier for

After incorporating feedback I hope to call for a vote by mid-week.  I seem

Hmm... I'm partial to the opposite route: abstracting away details like 
the structure of datasets, since they're driver-dependant. Do callers 
really need to know how datasets are organized? Is it even a warranted 
assumption that the data is on a filesystem? The more we get away from a 
black box model, the more maintenance it's going to be; the API surface 
area keeps going up and increases the combinatorial effects. No offence, 
but an RFC like this seems more like solving a symptom instead of a root 
cause.

GDAL should do all file and filesystem I/O as callbacks, and a utility 
reference library built on top that implements the callbacks for common 
cases like C stdlib I/O, GUI filesys browsers, etc. The more GDAL 
continues to know about files and filesys details, the more painful it's 
going to get.

Ray,

I don't quite get your point. Isn't it one of GDAL's main tasks to know 
about files and their details (or WCS data sources for that matter)?

I think this RFC with the "fast identify" allow us tool developers to 
build GUIs that let the users not to worry about those details - this is 
in my opinion a good thing, they just want to know which raster layers 
are available in a given data source. This is similar to what already 
can be done with OGR.

Regards,

Ari

Yes, some apps need that information. For instance, if your app wants to 
zip up a copy of a dataset then it needs to know which files to include 
in the ZIP. This is not a made up use case, it's a problem I and others 
have encountered in the past.

No it's not. The 3rd item in the "outstanding issues" section relates to 
that. If we properly document that behavior then perhaps it would be 
enough for GetFileList() to return NULL for datasets that are not 
file-based (e.g. WCS).

I guess I don't get the point either. I think this RFC serves a useful 
purpose, and I don't quite see how callbacks could do a better job in 
this case. If some callers don't care about the structure of a dataset 
then they can simply ignore the new methods, they are not required to do 
any extra work that they didn't have to do before.

I don't think this RFC relates to knowing which layers are part of a 
dataset, my understanding is that it's just intended to tell the caller 
which files constitute a dataset in case it needs to be zipped up or 
copied to a new location, etc.

I didn't think OGR already had a similar GetFileList() and family of 
methods. Did I miss that addition?

In order to use C++ API instead of C API (see

This is interesting, I will have a look soon, I think.

I like it. Is there a plan to add the same to OGR?

About CPLRenameOrCopy(), I find that the name may be a bit misleading. 
How about calling it CPLMove()?

Bas,

I tried replacing gridtemplates.h with the new one you provided and then 
I recompiled GDAL, but the error I was having is the same as before.

Just to speak about the same data... If I run gdalinfo on this file:

No it doesn't have. I was thinking more what the fast format

It turned out that one image out of several hundred in a collection didn't
have the projection defined.  I added a -s_srs option to my utility and
everything works smoothly again.

I didn't actually log the bug as another one popped up in a different spot
(in my utilities code) so I couldn't verify if the change fixes the problem
or just compiles ok.  I'd be happy to log it though.

Thanks for the helpful reply.

Craig,

I don't know why this would only affect one image out of many similar ones.
But I do think this code in Initialize() should not assume padfSrcNoDataImag
is non-NULL just because padfSrcNoDataReal is non-NULL

             if( hSrcBand != NULL
                 && psOptions->padfSrcNoDataReal != NULL )
             {
                 int bMergeSource = FALSE;

                 if( psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag[iBand] != 0.0
                     && !GDALDataTypeIsComplex( psOptions->eWorkingDataType
) )
                     bMergeSource = TRUE;

Could you file a bug on this, and I'll fix it in trunk and 1.4 branch.  I
think the fix would be to change:

                 if( psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag[iBand] != 0.0
                     && !GDALDataTypeIsComplex( psOptions->eWorkingDataType
) )
                     bMergeSource = TRUE;

to:
                 if( psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag != NULL
                     && psOptions->padfSrcNoDataImag[iBand] != 0.0
                     && !GDALDataTypeIsComplex( psOptions->eWorkingDataType
) )
                     bMergeSource = TRUE;

I didn't think OGR had an equivalent of RFC-11 either? I'm not trying to 
be picky, just trying to find out whether OGR already has some of those 
features that I was not aware of.

Dear list,

I have a small problem with building GDAL 1.4.1 with HDF5 support.
I use Mandriva 2007 (not yet the Spring 2007 version). It provides

libhdf5.a             libhdf5_hl.la         libhdf5.so

in /usr/lib; the corresponding header is located in /usr/include

in the standard repositories of Mandriva (libhdf5_0-1.6.5-2mdv2007.0
andlibhdf5_0-devel-1.6.5-2mdv2007.0 ).

when I run the configure script as follows

configure --prefix=/home/frooms/gdal-test --with-hdf5=/usr/lib

I get
	checking for H5Fopen in -lhdf5... no (yet with nm on libhdf5, it
responds with 0000549d T H5Fopen, so the symbol is defined)

...

  HDF5 support:              yes

When I checked the dependencies of gdal after compilation with ldd,
there was no mentioning of libhdf5, and linking ogrinfo failed
(undefined references to the HDF5 stuff).

What did I do wrong, and how can I build my GDAL then with HDF5 support?

Many thanks in advance.

Kind regards,

Filip Rooms

I did it using gdal_i.lib from FWTools1.2.1. But no more success, Matlab
(btw I use 7.4) is still saying:
??? Invalid MEX-file '<path>\test.mexw32' The specified procedure could not
be found.

But I downloaded GDAL sources and built with msvc8.0. and with add of
gdal14.dll in directory it seems to work.

I hope that programming will follow more easily now :p

Thanks for your help.

Filip,

I believe you should be using --with-hdf5=/usr or perhaps even just
--with-hdf5.  If you use /usr/lib it will look for include files in
/usr/lib/include and libraries in /usr/lib/lib.

It may also be instructive to see what gets inserted in the GDALmake.opt
file at this point:

#
# HDF5 Support.
#
HAVE_HDF5     = no
HDF5_INCLUDE  =

For HDF5 support to work, HAVE_HDF5 needs to be yes, HDF5_INCLUDE needs
to include the appropriate -I directive, and LIBS needs to include the
appropriate library definitions (eg. -L/usr/lib -lhdf5 I imagine).

Datasource has GetLayerCount and GetLayerByIndex methods. With these it 
is easy to develop dialog boxes which show only the available layers to 
the user. GDAL does not have such functionality, I'm hoping the RFC-11 
will give it that.

Daniel,

My client is only interested in RFC 11 and 12 support for raster data,
so I have no pursued adding them to OGR.  I also sort of feel that these
would be more appropriately incorporated into OGR at the point where OGR's
driver model gets merged with GDAL's (GDAL/OGR 2.0?).

Agreed, I will update.

Ray,

As Daniel points out there are several use cases where it is important
to be able to manage the files associated with a dataset.  I'm initially
implementing the GetFileList() primarily in support of the delete, and
rename operations.

But in the FDO library (used by MapGuide) there is a concept of being able
to "bundle up a dataset in a zip file and send to the server" and doing this
also requires a list of associated files.

In MapServer I would like to be able to write a dataset with GDAL and then
ask for all the files so I can zip them up and return them to a client.

Clearly most applications using GDAL aren't going to need to know details
about which files are associated with a dataset.  We did get through
quite a few years without this info though it often meant people building
a bit of format specific logic into their applications.

 > Is it even a warranted
> assumption that the data is on a filesystem?

There are clearly some datasets that are no in the file system - such
as WCS for instance.  There are also some datasets which are in memory
using the /vsimem/ virtual file system, but for our purposes we can
treat this as a filesystem as long as great care is taken to use the
VSI*L API to access it.

I'm not sure I agree with this.

That is exactly the intention of the VSI*L API - a POSIX-like virtualization
of file IO so we can have files in memory, in the file system, and in the
future possibly files accessed out of zip files, etc.

However, that doesn't address the need to manage these datasets which is
what RFC 12 attempts to help with.

I'd add that not all drivers use the VSI*L API.  In some cases they just
need to be updated.  In other cases the driver is built on an external
library that doesn't give us the option of replacing the IO mechanism.

Well, I think you need to provide a few concrete examples of this so we
can better understand your point.  I certainly don't want routine GDAL
applications to need to know much.  They don't know and I don't think
that is changing.

Ari,

I normally think of OGRLayer's as being analygous to bands, and GDAL
already provides good mechanism to enumerate and query band information.

I think something like RFC 11 and 12 could be equally useful for OGR,
but it just isn't on my priority list, and as mentioned earlier I hope
it will come nearly for free as part of a "grand unification" one day.

Frank,

I like this idea, along with RFC-11 will be a great addition. Wouldn't
it be possible that the whole  set of Rename/Move/Delete operations
was exposed to the SWIG interface by default?

Best regards,

Hmm, I've been using OGROpen with a directory name instead of filename. 
Then I've been able to loop through all vector data layers (for example 
shapefiles) in that directory. I've sometimes wondered what happens if 
there are for example shapefiles _and_ mapinfo files in the same directory.

I've thought that that's a neat feature since sometimes the layers do 
not have any correspondance with the filenames.

Tamas,

The RFC calls for the RenameDataset being exposed through SWIG, and I
see that the Delete operation for datasets is already available through
SWIG.

Are you perhaps referring to the lower level CPL/VSI file operation
functions?

Ari,

I see what you mean.  This is a convenience offered by some OGR drivers.

If a directory contains a mixture of shapefiles and mapinfo files any
attempt to open the directory will give you a shapefile datasource and
the mapinfo files will be ignored.

It's important to keep in mind that this "open a directory" support
is a feature of a driver, not OGR in general.  Only a couple drivers
support this and it isn't always done in an equivelent approach.

Hi All,

This typemap causes a warning for the C# when generating the
interface. In spite of dealing with the addition of a skeleton
implementation of this typemap I would rather remove this one
permanently from Band.i. As far as I can see this typemap is not
really used at any of the bindings along with the IF_ERR_RETURN_NONE.

Any objections to such change?

Ari,

Shouldn't that be the case only for shapefile just because the dbfs are been
recognized first by OGR? 

That could be the case because in dbf you can have a folder representing a
database where the contained dbf files are tables of that database, even
though that is not what the users think of their shapefile attribute table.

So the ODBC driver recognized the folder as a data source just because it
has dbf files on it.

Nice feature anyway,

Regards,

Ivan

Fabio,

Currently GDAL/OGR has no special support for transforming from
georeferenced coordinates to viewport coordinates.  Applications normally
address this in their own fashion.

According to the previous posts a new typemap had be introduced to
implement this feature. The current implementation looks like this:

#ifdef SWIGCSHARP
  %apply (double *inout) {(double*)};
#endif
  void TransformPoints( int nCount, double *x, double *y, double *z ) {
    OCTTransform( self, nCount, x, y, z );
  }
#ifdef SWIGCSHARP
  %clear (double*);
#endif

I would propose to implement the 'double *inout' typemap for passing
variable length arrays to the TransformPoints function. The nCount
parameter should be used to create the intermediary array of the
proper size inside the typemap implementation. At this time I've made
the %apply internal to C# not disturbing the others with unexpected
warnings during the interface generation.
However in the future if folks would want to use this item from the
other languages as well, and this typemap will widely be implemented I
would propose to remove the #ifdefs from this implementation.

Tamas

Frank,

Oops. We've indeed Driver.Delete as you've mentioned that is surely be
responsible to remove the underlying files in the filesystem. In this
regard the Rename and Move functionality would also be required at the
SWIG interface. At this time exposing the CPL/VSI low level file
operations would not be so benefical.

Tamas

Message-ID: <002b01c790f6$33696c10$7401a8c0@sherpa>

When using gdalwarp on paletted geotiffs that have "TILED=YES" and
"COMPRESS=LZW" set during creation I'm running into a couple of problems.  I
confirmed via gdalinfo that all input files have the projection defined as
EPSG:4326.

Problem #1
Gdalwarp existing_file1.tif existing_file2.tif corrupts the second image.
Projection is stripped, and none of my apps (non-gdal) can read the image
(E.g. global mapper).  gdalinfo shows the projection being stripped, still
paletted image.  Any suggestions on how to merge two geotiffs in this
format?

Problem #2
gdalwarp -te xmin ymin xmax ymax infile.tif outfile.tif
Outputfile has no projection defined, compression is lost, and I assume
tiling is too.
Everything works ok if I specify -co options, -s_srs, -t_srs, etc but I
thought it was supposed to output everything the same as the input.

An issue here is that the returned filenames might not refer to files, 
unless you know which VSI*L filesyshandler was used. Usually this 
assumption is harmless -- the default handler is assigned at compile 
time and set to use the machine's normal filesystem -- but when one 
starts using other filesyshandlers (like you said, for mem and so 
forth), then the assumption breaks.

If we want to enumerate and manage the physical entities in a dataset 
regardless of how their storage is implemented, and add entity 
management methods to GDALDataSet, the dataset needs to know how the 
entities were stored. But storage details lie outside the driver. The 
driver would need to forward an entity management call to the same 
filesyshandler that originally wrote the entity.

So what we need is to have datasets know which filesyshandler they are 
using. The driver's methods need an extra filesyshandler parameter, 
which they can forward to datasets as part of the openinfo or something 
similar. VSIFOpenL() needs to take a filesyshandler parameter, or 
drivers should be able to call VSIFilesystemHandler::Open().

Then I could pass a filesyshandler subclass to driver::Create(), and 
have the dataset do all of it's I/O with it, and know which 
filesyshandler to use when doing entity management.

Issues like subdatasets could then be handled by treating the base 
dataset as a filesystem, and implementing a filesyshandler for that 
dataset's format.

Ray,

The current virtual file system stuff is handled by installing a global
IO handler for a particular aspect of the filesystem namespace.  So,
for instance, the "in memory filesystem" stuff is all in the filesystem
area under /vsimem/.  Filesystem handlers are globally installed.  So
I don't see any need to make the file system handler apparent by
specifically passing it into Create() methods or to VSIOpenL().

I think there are two levels of indirection implicit in your statement.
One is at the VSI*L level which is raw binary data.  But subdatasets are
really a GDAL concept and their meaning vary from format to format.  I'm
not sure how to mesh this all.

Craig,

I don't see this result.  I suspect it relates to the specific version
of libtiff being used.  Some important fixes have gone into libtiff in
support of GDAL using it for random update to compressed files (ie.
gdalwarp using LZW compression).

You might want to try this with gdal's trunk (development) version,
and configured to use the internal libtiff (--with-tiff=internal).  If
the problem persists and we will see if we can reproduce it.

I also do not see this result.  I just tried:

gdalwarp -te 440000 3720000 470000 3750000 utm.tif out.tif

and out.tif has the same coordinate system as the input file.  The compression
and tiling are not copied over.  These are considered to be file specific
options, and not part of the overall GDAL data model, so they do not carry
over to a copied file.

If you can file a bug demonstrating the coordinate system we can certainly
try and fix it, but this doesn't normally happen so it must be something
very specific to your situation.

Frank,

Thanks for the help.  I'll try a newer version of libtiff and the latest
version of gdal and see how it goes.  It's been a while since I've updated
my source tree anyway.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Adding GDALCreateColorRamp() to the GDAL C API
Message-ID: <000601c79132$e2a3dad0$0a0a0a0a@idrisi.clarku.edu>

Hi there,

Someone from the list has pointed out a bug in the RST driver that happens
when converting a thematic raster image (color table + category names) from
RST to HFA:

   gdal_translate -of hfa thematic1.rst thematic.img
   Input file size is 800, 600
   0...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80...90...100 - done.
   ERROR 1: iRow (-1) out of range.

That problem only happens when the associated color table file is missing (a
.smp file). It is unusual but it happens. So, in order to fix that problem I
have developed a function to automatically generate color table.

But instead of placing that function in the RST driver I asked Frank if we
should put that function for general use in the GDALColorTable and in the C
API. 

He agreed and he also suggested some changes that made it even more generic
and useful.

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/gcore/gdalcolortable.cpp#L299 

What GDALCreateColorRamp() does is to create a linear distribution of values
in Red, Green, Blue and Alpha from the initial color to end color, starting
from one index to another anywhere in the color table.

   GDALColorEntry sColor1;
   sColor1.c1 = (short) ( 255 );
   sColor2.c2 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor3.c3 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor4.c4 = (short) ( 255 );

   GDALColorEntry sColor2;
   sColor2.c1 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor2.c2 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor2.c3 = (short) ( 255 );
   sColor2.c4 = (short) ( 255 );

  poColorTable->CreateColorRamp( 0, &sColor1, 32, &sColor2 );

It can also be used to create several ramp segments into the same color
table as follows:

   GDALColorEntry sColor1;
   sColor1.c1 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor1.c2 = (short) ( 255 );
   sColor1.c3 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor1.c4 = (short) ( 255 );

   GDALColorEntry sColor2;
   sColor2.c1 = (short) ( 100 );
   sColor2.c2 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor2.c3 = (short) ( 255 );
   sColor2.c4 = (short) ( 255 );

   GDALColorEntry sColor3;
   sColor3.c1 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor3.c2 = (short) ( 0 );
   sColor3.c3 = (short) ( 80 );
   sColor3.c4 = (short) ( 255 );

   poColorTable->CreateColorRamp( 0, &sColor1, 128, &sColor2 );
   poColorTable->CreateColorRamp( 129, &sColor2, 255, &sColor3 );

I hope that you will find it useful. There are others techniques that I
would like to explorer so any suggestion at this point, or anytime actually,
will be welcome.

With the best regards to all,

Ivan Lucena

Dear Frank,

While the error persists on my primary computer (WinXp 2GB Ram), I
haven't been able to reproduce the error on my other available computer
(Win64 3GB Ram). So I guess the error is somewhat hardware related,
which I think makes it difficult to file a decent bug report.

I'll give up for now, but I might return to the issue at a later time.

Best regards
Asger

Asger,

If you can file a bug sufficient for us to reproduce this, I could have
Mateusz do some digging.  But it seems like the problems is deep in the
ECW SDK and it likely to be very hard for us to ferret out.

Hmm... I see... you've got VSIFOpenL() using the filename to choose 
which filesystem driver to use.

So this is like URLs, then, with filenames having a protocol prefix (the 
name of the filesys handler) and then the normal pathspec. Well, there's 
a slim chance of namespace collision with folders having filesys handler 
names; a stricter protocol syntax would fix that but I suppose it's not 
critical.

To be safe, let's try an example... say I make a filesys handler that 
lets netCDF files be treated as filesystems. The physical file is 
'c:/work/file'. I want the netCDF dataset to use my handler, however, so 
I give it '/netcdfsys/c:/work/file/subdataset_02'. The driver calls 
VSIFOpenL, the netCDF filesys handler gets its Open() method called, 
passes 'c:/work/file' to the default handler, uses the returned FILE* to 
read the file and locate the subdataset_02 section, and then stores the 
returned FILE* inside a netCDF_FILE*, along with the other info that 
tracks the subdataset for all the remaining I/O operations.

So it should be alright, although the potential for namespace problems 
remains. Net protocols solve it by having explicit protocol prefixes and 
using different pathspec symbols for protocol vs. filesystem items 
(e.g., ':' vs '/'.), and browsers usually treat a missing protocol ID as 
indicating the local filesystem. And having a single registry of shared 
protocol names (shared unregistered ones could start with 'x-' perhaps).

So dataset::GetFiles() would use the original pathspec which has the 
protocol ID, so that works. /netCDFsys/ version of GetFiles() can return 
a valid entity list, and likewise process any other entity calls.

Longer protocol chaining should be possible, but care has to be taken to 
appends items to the pathspec that each filesys driver expects. 
/netCDFsys/, for example, expects to treat the physical file as a folder 
and to find a subdataset ID after the file's name. But if the file can 
be interpreted as both a container and a file by /netCDFsys/, we need a 
name to indicate the root level of the file, e.g., c:/work/file// or 
c:/work/file/root. But the filesys handler developer documents protocol 
details like that as needed, so that shouldn't be an issue.

A three-level chain would be e.g., /ramcache/ caching /netCDFsys/ which 
in turn is using the default filesys handler. The pathspec would be 
"/ramcache/netCDFSys/c:/work/file/subdataset_02". An open() call winds 
up opening c:/work/file, then /netCDFSys/ opens subdataset_02, then 
/ramcache/ copies the contents of subdataset_02 to memory and all I/O 
occurs there. Upon close(), /ramcache/ calls /netCDFsys/::write(entire 
file), which in turns call the default write() to update the correct 
subpart of the actual file.

(/ramcache/ is a poor example since OS's and GDAL cache I/O already,
but is used for simplicity's sake.)

Filesys handler makes sense if the subdataset is self-contained and 
appears to be in a driver-recognizable format (i.e., files within 
files), or if the file's format is really just a wrapper around other 
formats (say, an embedded JPEG inside an email message). Otherwise, 
yeah, things analogous to VRTdataset are a better choice, and addressing 
the subdatasets becomes a driver-level Open() or Create() option.

If you need to do operations like GetFiles() on a subdataset, however, 
then a filesys handler should be used. For example, to use your case of 
wanting a list of files for zipping and sending to a client -- we would 
want the subdataset to have the filesys return a list of named entities 
(which would be chunks within the containing file, so the names are 
resolvable to offsets and lengths), and then the filesys handler would 
perform the requisite read I/O to provide the "files" for zipping. 
GetFileList() has to of course return each filename with the filesys 
handler name prefix, and these filenames are only valid for opening with 
VSI*L calls.

Dear colleagues..

Today i got an HDF4 format dataset to help on and somehow I'm to 
stupid to tell my colleagues to tell how to read it in..
Usually I was reading it using the gdalinfo,
identifying the
SUBDATASET_1_NAME

and than use that for the gdalwarp process..

with that HDF file now i have no idea how to call the substring. and 
after playing around for 3 hours with different combinations i 
deccide to call for help..
If anybody can tell me the file/band string from the gdalinfo command 
given below, i'm quite happy ..

Someone can help me? 

Many thanks to all.

Hannes,

It seems that this file can be used directly without fooling with
subdatasets.  I think this is a special case in the code for HDF4
files with only one subdataset.  Accessing the main file is treated
as equivelent to accessing that subdatset.  So you can just do stuff like:

   gdalwarp GEO2004001.hdf out.tif

I see the file is 11277x3086 with 1 16bit band and a nice regular sampling
in geographic coordinates.

Mario,

I *suspect* this is due to running out of memory.  The JasPer library tends
to be very memory hungry and in proportion to the size of the image being
compressed or decompressed.  I think you will have to either stick to smaller
images, get more RAM or consider using a different JPEG2000 encoder that is
less memory hungry.

The JP2KAK and JP2ECW drivers in GDAL (depending on the proprietary
Kakadu library and the open source ECW SDK respectively) should have much
better memory performance.  They are both built into the FWTools binaries
if you want to try them out.

   http://fwtools.maptools.org/

Of course, I could be wrong and the issue could be something else.

Best regards,

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Problem using EPSG in C#
Message-ID: <f1q1df$k87$1@sea.gmane.org>

Sorry if this is a newbie question, but someone has to ask them to.

I'm trying to make use of the EPSG-codes in setting up a pair 
OGR.SpatialReference and an OGR.CoordinateTransformation.
I can make this work in one small test application but in the main one 
it just doesn't work.

Sample code:
  private CoordinateTransformation toWGS;
  private CoordinateTransformation fromWGS;
SpatialReference source;
SpatialReference wgs84;
   source = new SpatialReference("");
   int EPSG = 3021;
   int res = source.ImportFromEPSG(EPSG);

   wgs84 = new SpatialReference(Projections.WKT("WGS84"));
   fromWGS = new CoordinateTransformation(wgs84, source);
   toWGS = new CoordinateTransformation(source, wgs84);

where the wgs84 is set up from a WKT-string.

What I guess I miss is how to set up the paths and so between/to the 
different data files.
GDAL is located in FWTools\bin (on the PATH)
EPSG-catalouge in FWTools\Data (also on the PATH) and also copied to the 
  VSE project.
But how SHOULD it be? I stumble in darkness...

The result of the Import is by the way a 6.

Or how do you suggest I approach this, how do I set up the 
transformation? What "standard" is easiest for me to use? The goal of 
this application is to be able to map any projection (well, some) to 
WGS84 and back. The user is to be able to manually set projection and 
also be read from files (via GDALInfo is the idea).

pls.

Yours
Tomas

Tomas,

I think what you need to do is call Gdal.PushFinderLocation()
with the path to the GDAL data directory as the argument.

When applications are run from within the FWTools Shell this is
accomplished via an environment variable (GDAL_DATA), but freestanding
applications can call CPLPushFinderLocation() which in the csharp
bindings is (I believe) known as Gdal.PushFinderLocation().

I have tried
GDAL.gdal.SetConfigOption("GDAL_DATA",@"C:\Program\FWTools1.2.0\data\");

and
             GDAL.gdal.PushFinderLocation(@"C:\Program\FWTools1.2.0\data\");

but still gets the same error.
I take a peek at
GDAL.gdal.GetConfigOption("GDAL_DATA", dummy)
and, yes, it is set to
"C:\\Program\\FWTools1.2.0\\data\\"

Perhaps I should try using the latest version of GDAL#-bindings?

Subject: [Gdal-dev] problem abotu reprojection with ogr2ogr
Message-ID: <0JHQ005NGI3P9840@mailmx1.und.nodak.edu>

Hi, everyone,

 

I have a shp file and landsat data of the same field, but these data's
projections are different. The projection information of shp file is below:

 

GEOGCS["GCS_Assumed_Geographic_1",DATUM["D_North_American_1927",SPHEROID["Cl
arke_1866",6378206.4,294.9786982]],PRIMEM["Greenwich",0.0],UNIT["Degree",0.0
174532925199433]]

 

We can get this information from .prj file or use command 'ogrinfo' .

 

The projection information of landsat data is:

 

PROJCS["WGS 84 / UTM zone 14N",

    GEOGCS["WGS 84",

        DATUM["WGS_1984",

            SPHEROID["WGS 84",6378137,298.2572235629972,

                AUTHORITY["EPSG","7030"]],

            AUTHORITY["EPSG","6326"]],

        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],

        UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],

        AUTHORITY["EPSG","4326"]],

    PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],

    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],

    PARAMETER["central_meridian",-99],

    PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],

    PARAMETER["false_easting",500000],

    PARAMETER["false_northing",0],

    UNIT["metre",1,

        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],

AUTHORITY["EPSG","32614"]]

 

I copy this information into a empty file, then saved as 'landsat.prj'.

 

Now I use 'ogr2ogr' to reproject the shp file in order that the shp file has
the same projection information with landsat data. The command is as below:

 

ogr2ogr -s_srs input.prj -t_srs landsat.prj output.shp input.shp

 

When I put the output.shp and input.shp into ArcGIS together, there a shift
between two file. Dose anyone know the reason? Is there any problem with my
command?

 

Thanks in advance.

 

Lijian

Subject: [Gdal-dev] .ige spill file in HFA keeps growing!
Message-ID: <4640BF81.8080802@missouri.edu>

I have been playing with HFA format for the last couple of months. 
Before this, we were using GeoTiff format.  But GeoTiff inability to
handle image size >4GB forced us to switch to HFA. 

For those who have used HFA format, it basically store the image in a
single file if the image size is <2GB.  Anything bigger will cause a
"spill" file (.ige) to be created. 

So I am trying to create a new HFA file using Create() with HFA driver. 
Everything works as expected, except that I began noticing my .ige file
keeps growing in size.  Apparently, if I try to create a file, and there
exists an HFA file of the same image size (with an .ige present) in the
disk already, instead of overwriting the old file Create() simply
appends the new HFA image to the existing .ige file.  So if I run the
program several time in the same directory, the .ige file will balloon
up in size in proportion to the number of times you try to create the
HFA file.

When I try to open the HFA image using OpenEV, the image looked wrong. 
Blocks are misaligned and scattered all over the place.  However, I can
still access the image correctly using GDAL.  gdalinfo also displays the
correct metadata, and hfatest does not show any anomaly either (that I
know of).

I just wish Create() in HFA format would overwrite any old file.

Anyone ever experienced this problem with HFA?

Thanks

Ozy

Is this perhaps the same sa ticket:1471, where starting with gdalwarp

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Read image file to Numpy, then output to image
Message-ID: <4f44d320705081528i12a1c135lcac204dbbf7da619@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need some guidance on a path to take.  I am working on a little image
processing package written in Python for a class I teach in Remote Sensing.

>From other posts in other mail lists, I have been encouraged to look at gdal
for loading a multi-band image file into numpy, process it, then write it
out to an image format.

I am using Python 2.4, gdal-python-13.win32-py2.4 that I installed from the
.exe and numpy-1.0.2.win32-py2.4 from the exe and python image library
1.1.6win32-py2.4.  All of these have been installed correctly.  I would have
installed the 1.4.1 version of gdal, but I did not see an .exe and when I
tried to follow the instructions for changing the path and the gdal_data
environment variable, the import gdal was not recognized, so I chose a .exe
that seemed to work.

On this note, I attempted to follow the basic tutorial for loading an image
file.  (I tried a multi-band .TIF and ERDAS Imagine file).  The message I
received was--

img = gdal.gdal.Open('c:\\nate\\remote_sensing\\pyth_img_test.tif',
GA_ReadOnly)
AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'gdal'

Here is my code below just for testing the reading of a multi-band image
file to then load it into a numpy array.  From here I want to do some pixel
by pixel processing.

-----------------------------

import Image, numpy, gdal, sys, os

img = gdal.Open('c:\\nate\\remote_sensing\\pyth_img_test.tif', GA_ReadOnly)

A = numpy.asarray(img)        #Convert the image to a numpy array

print A.shape
print A.size
print "Num Rows: " + str(A.shape[0])
print "Num Cols: " + str(A.shape[1])
print "Num bands: " + str(A.ndim)


------------------------------------

I also saw on the threads to access the FWTools, which I have loaded and
they seem to have slightly different methods of use.  My goal is to create a
little image processing package that I can give out to students to work with
multi-band imagery and do some of the things that FWTools has or OpenEV has,
but it a little more intuitive and can process more than 3 bands of
imagery.  Plus some of the documentation for some of the functions in
FWTools or OpenEV does not exist or the functions are a little cumbersome to
use.  I am also thinking about what will be required by the student to load
in order to use my python image processing application.  I want this to be
straight forward too...so if I am having difficulty with loading libraries,
having to change path variables, etc, then this is too much for the novie
Remote Sensing student.  I am not into compiliing my own libraries and will
be pushing my programming limits with writing C++, binding python to c++
code, etc.  I do have some programming experience with C++.  I was in an
algorithms class about 10 yrs ago while in grad school programming many of
the remote sensing algorthims....the problem was they were running under
OS/2 and were limited to the old ERDAS .LAN format.

I would appreciate some help in getting the image to read in a numpy array
as well as any feedback on re-directing my efforts if there is something
that I can tap into (such as FWTools libraries, OpenEV libraries).  It seems
that Frank has put alot of this together in different places, I am just
trying to get some of what is out there more combined to work on multi-band
imagery and RADAR (TIF, ERDAS Imagine files).

Thanks for any help.

Nate

Subject: [Gdal-dev] GMT driver in OGR - How to activate it?
Message-ID: <4640FD41.20006@ualg.pt>

Hi,
I just installed (under Windows) the trunk version where the GMT driver 
for OGR exists in
...gdal-svn-trunk-2007.05.08\ogr\ogrsf_frmts\gmt

However when I try to use it I get
Unable to find driver `GMT'
and in fact it is not listed by ogr2ogr --formats

How do we "activate" it?
Brent Wood told us in one of the GMT lists that it was ready to test/use

Thanks

Joaquim,

I have confirmed that the windows makefiles omitted an important
bit.  In particular, -DGMT_ENABLED was not defined in the file
gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/generic/makefile.vc so the driver wasn't
being registered by default.

I have committed a fix. I'd suggest you "svn update" and do a
"nmake /f makefile.vc clean" and "nmake /f makefile.vc" to rebuild.

Best regards,

Lijian,

I think the first question is to determine whether ogr2ogr is applying
the expected NAD27 to WGS84 datum correction or not.  What is the apparent
offset?  1m?  100m?  1000's of meters?

If it is 1m it might just be some sort of precision issue.  If it is
10's of meters or 100's of meters then it is likely that the NAD27 to
NAD83 datum shift isn't being applied.  If it is thousands of meters or
more than it is likely some other issue.

One technique to test if datum shift files are being applied is to
set the PROJ_DEBUG environment variable to some value. Then PROJ.4
should report each file it opens.  If it doesn't reporting opening a
file with a name like "conus" then or ntv1.gsb then it isn't even
trying to do the datum shifting.

The input NAD27 geographic coordinate system looks odd.  You might try
altering your command to use:

   ogr2ogr -s_srs NAD27 -t_srs landsat.prj output.shp input.shp

This will provide a less ambiguous declaration that the input
coordinate system in NAD27.

Folks,

Doh!  I just realized that my original contract delivery also included a copy
operation.  I would like to withdraw my original motion, and instead move
to adopt a revised version of RFC 12 which includes a Copy operator:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc12_filemanagement

The copy operator works similarly to rename, but doesn't alter the source.

Frank,
Thanks, its working now.

One little thing about this driver (well it applies to other ascii 
format as well)
In GMT we have the possibility to select the printing format on the 
command line
(for example, --D_FORMAT=%.1f)
I noticed that figures are being written with 11 decimal places. This 
makes files
grow by a significant amount which will be particularly noticeable with 
big files.
So I guess the question is, isn't it desirable to implement a similar 
mechanism
within OGR ascii formats? Or am I being too picky?

Joaquim,

I'd be willing to implement such a feature if there is significant
interest in it, but I'd rather see it held as one of several things
to do on a second pass through the driver since it is just an optimization.

Currently the driver uses the same formatting function used for forming
WKT geometries, which has some logic manage precision.

To perhaps make things a bit clearer:
I use GDAL for C# found in the distribution with FWTools. It works like 
a charm when using WKT-strings for setting up the SpatialReferences, as 
long as I get the strings correct. My environment is WinXP and Visual 
Studio Express 2005.

I have a small stand-alone test application where I check how GDAL works 
and try new ways to do things. This one compiles to a single executable. 
When I try the EPSG-codes they work if I copy the data-files (all the 
csv and others) to the root of the project in VSE. When compiled this 
gives that the data-files are in the same folder as the executable and 
the depending C#-DLLs.
But I can't make it work if the data-files are on any other location, on 
any other path!
I try with
GDAL.gdal.SetConfigOption("GDAL_DATA",@"C:\Program\FWTools1.2.2\data\");
and
GDAL.gdal.PushFinderLocation(@"C:\Program\FWTools1.2.2\data\");
but no success. Is the paths badly formed? Are more paths needed?

The goal is to use the EPSG-method in my main-application, a dll which 
is plugged in to another software. There I can't get it work in anyway, 
I have tried the same approach of copying the data-files to no luck.

What do I miss? How do I properly set up the path to the data-files? Do 
I miss some initialization command? Can I query GDAL and check the setup 
or the available data-files?

Yours
Tomas

I add to previous posts  a try with FileMon.

I start with calling gdal.PusFinderLocation and gdal.SetConfigOption, I 
verify with gdal.GetConfigOtion that the path is set correct but when I 
try setting up a SpatialReference the path I have set is completely ignored.
A bug in C# implementation or do I miss something vital?

The path found with FileMon is, for example:

GdalTest1.vshos:2028	OPEN	D:\Documents and Settings\Tomas\Mina 
dokument\Visual Studio 
2005\Projects\GdalTest1\GdalTest1\bin\Debug\csv\horiz_cs.csv	PATH NOT 
FOUND	Options: Open  Access: Read
	
(the path should bee C:\Program\FWTools1.2.2\data\)

Perhaps I should skip EPSG completely but it seems to bee such nice and 
simple approach! And I don't like to leave things that don't work, but 
should work, behind me!

Please
help

Tomas,

Thank you for the detailed analysis of the problem. I'm working on
this issue and will notify you if I have further information. In the
meantime I would suggest to submit a ticket including the example
code.

Ok, done that. Included as specific info as I could.

You should be able to reproduce it.

Since the copy function is called pfnCopyFiles(), should we call the 
rename function pfnMoveFiles() instead of pfnRename(), just for consistency?

Actually, at the higher level I see that you have GDALCopyDatasetFiles() 
and GDALRenameDataset() ... um ... why the "Files" suffix in one case 
and not the other?

Daniel,

I added the word Files to the Copy operation to try and clarify the
distinction between it and the CreateCopy() method which is a "data
model oriented" copy rather than a literal file copy.

I would agree that it is peculiar that rename and copy are not similarly
named in this regard.

Hi, Frank,

Thank you very much for your information. I tried the command you suggested
but there is still a 25 meter shift.

I transformed the projection with ArcGIS and got good result without shift.

Lijian,

I think the first question is to determine whether ogr2ogr is applying
the expected NAD27 to WGS84 datum correction or not.  What is the apparent
offset?  1m?  100m?  1000's of meters?

If it is 1m it might just be some sort of precision issue.  If it is
10's of meters or 100's of meters then it is likely that the NAD27 to
NAD83 datum shift isn't being applied.  If it is thousands of meters or
more than it is likely some other issue.

One technique to test if datum shift files are being applied is to
set the PROJ_DEBUG environment variable to some value. Then PROJ.4
should report each file it opens.  If it doesn't reporting opening a
file with a name like "conus" then or ntv1.gsb then it isn't even
trying to do the datum shifting.

The input NAD27 geographic coordinate system looks odd.  You might try
altering your command to use:

   ogr2ogr -s_srs NAD27 -t_srs landsat.prj output.shp input.shp

This will provide a less ambiguous declaration that the input
coordinate system in NAD27.

Best regards,

For those interested the ticket number is 1621. Just click the link to 
read the ticket:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1621

Hope this will be solved sometime soon. I have other things to attack in

Message-ID: <4f44d320705090918y4761ed31pbe3b2a2f721ab9a8@mail.gmail.com>

My previous question was:

I loaded gdal-python-13.win32-py2.4.exe (this came from UrbanSim download
page).
I have Python 2.4 from ActiveState
I have numpy-1.0.2.win32-py2.4.exe installed
I have PIL 1.1.6 installed

Once I installed the gdal, I was testing if I could load an image
(multispectral TIF file into a numpy array).

I received the message back when I did the following:

AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'Open'

I doulbe checked that I had the various modules and that I had the _gdal.pyd
in my DLLs directory and there was a __init__.py in my site-packages\gdal
directory.

I also tried running other type of functions like gdal.AllRegister(), etc.
and I received the same Error as above.

I am trying to determine if I did anything incorrectly during the install or
how I might go about fixing the problem and if anyone has had a similar
problem.

Thanks for any assistance.

Nate

Once you've got it figured out, you should be able make it as simple as 
running some installers. Or maybe you can py2exe an app, and really make 
it easy.

I'm guessing you can do a lot of what you want without using C++.

I got a little lost in your explanation of what you really need, but 
we'll certainly help with how to accomplish specific tasks.

Try the above, and see how far you get.

It looks like something is odd in your install. I haven't got it set up 
on Windows, so I don't know what may have happened, but:

1) It sounds like "import gdal" works. That's a good start.

2) Your error: "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'gdal'" 
means that python isn't finding that function, so it has nothing to do 
with registering drivers or anything. I'd guess you have an incomplete 
install somehow.

3) try:

 >>> import gdal
 >>> print dir(gdal).

You should get a LOT of stuff, including Open(). If you want to make it 
a bit easier to see what you've got:

 >>> for i in dir(gdal):
...    print i

Let us know what you get, and maybe we can help.

Sorry I'm Windows-clueless at the moment -- can someone help this guy?

By the way, it looks like you're only replying to me -- which is the 
default for the mailing list. I'd make sure this gets to the list -- 
someone there can be fr more helpful than me.

Tamas has been a contributor to GDAL/OGR core capabilities (RFC 6: Geometry
and Feature Style as OGR Special Fields), to the csharp bindings and to
discussions of RFCs on the mailing list.   He has demonstrated a long term
commitment to GDAL/OGR (and MapServer) and I feel he would be an asset to the
GDAL PSC.

Currently the GDAL PSC is only 4 people, so I also think growing it is useful.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] r.out.gdal vs gdal_translate vs gdalwarp
Message-ID: <46422286.1050300@o2.pl>

Hi

I have noticed that analogous options settings in r.out.gdal,
gdal_translate and gdalwarp result in GeoTIFF's of significantly
different sizes. Sorry for crossposting, but I have no idea if it is
and issue in GDAL or GRASS.

Take the following example, based on GRASS spearfish60 location, raster
elevation.dted:

$ r.out.gdal in=elevation.dted format=GTiff type=Byte out=grass_copy.tif

	grass_copy.tif = 36965 bytes

$ gdal_translate grass_copy.tif grass_trans_copy.tif

	grass_trans_copy.tif = 29153 bytes

$ gdalwarp grass_copy.tif grass_warp_copy.tif

	grass_warp_copy.tif = 36336 bytes

Each command does only a raw copy of input. Sizes of the r.out.gdal and
gdalwarp outputs are similar, but the gdal_translate output is 1/6
smaller. Is that normal?



Another example, with LZW compression:

$ r.out.gdal in=elevation.dted format=GTiff type=Byte out=grass_lzw.tif
createopt=COMPRESS=LZW

	grass_lzw.tif = 23497 bytes

$ gdal_translate -co "COMPRESS=LZW" grass_copy.tif grass_trans_lzw.tif

	grass_trans_lzw.tif =  21601 bytes

$ gdalwarp -co "COMPRESS=LZW" grass_copy.tif grass_warp_lzw.tif

	grass_warp_lzw.tif = 22868 bytes

Differences between the 3 tiffs here are not huge, yet still
significant. Is that OK? I thought each should be more less the same.



The only difference in the gdalinfo output of each of the 3 tiffs in
either the first or second example is 7 lines of metadata, which are
present in r.out.gdal and gdal_translate output while missing in
gdalwarp output. However, it is only 397 bytes, which is not enough to
explain kilobytes of differences.

If that's good practice then that works for me too. :)

Analysing the two files with tiffdump, I note:

grass_copy.tif:
StripByteCounts (279) LONG (4) 4<8170 8170 8170 8170>

grass_trans_copy.tif:
StripByteCounts (279) LONG (4) 4<8170 8170 8170 2090>

The difference is 6080 bytes, which is ~3/4 of the 7812 byte
difference between the files. Also:

grass_copy.tif:
34735 (0x87af) SHORT (3) 32<1 1 0 7 1024 0 1 1 1025 0 1 1 1026 34737 33 0 2049 34737 8 33 2054 0 1 9102 ...>
34737 (0x87b1) ASCII (2) 42<UTM Zone 13, Northern He ...>

grass_trans_copy.tif:
34735 (0x87af) SHORT (3) 32<1 1 0 7 1024 0 1 1 1025 0 1 1 1026 34737 21 0 2049 34737 6 21 2054 0 1 9102 ...>
34737 (0x87b1) ASCII (2) 28<NAD27 / UTM zone 13N|NAD ...>

[tag 34735 differs in the 15th field; 33 vs 21; I haven't looked up
the details on that tag, but it's likely to be GeoTIFF.]

Tomas,

You'll have to comment out the
CSHARP_STATIC_LINKAGE = YES
in csharp.opt and recompile the C# interface. Using this setting the
csharp dll-s will link against the gdal14.dll so the
PushFinderLocation and ImportFromEPSG will operate on the same global
data. In the future I consider to use this setting as the default
option.

BTW: I would propose to use the latest development version of the C#
related stuff. There were some fundamental changes in the interface
that might cause some changes in the existing code. For more
information see:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/GdalOgrCsharpVersions

You might also use the binaries of the latest FWTools
http://test.gdal.org/fwtools/FWTools130.exe
and replace the *_wrap.dll-s and *_csharp.dll-s inside with the
compiled version.

Best regards,

Tamas

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Dealing with a GeoTiff with incorrect band ColorInterp
	values
Message-ID: <CFE1D6CAE2D44343BF58E308C1C7EC6488571B@rmg-server03.rmg.local>

I have a geotiff I'm testing my C# program with, which has three bands:
Band 1 is ColorInterp.GCI_GrayIndex, and the other two are
ColorInterp.GCI_Undefined.  The three bands are actually meant to be R,
G, B in this particular image.

 

I'm using the command-line gdalwarp to save the file back to disk as
with large datasets I've had problems with OutOfMemoryExceptions when
doing too much processing in memory.

 

I have to take this image and warp it to WGS84 and then extract tiles
out of it to insert into a database, but gdalwarp gives the following
error:

 

ERROR 5: GDALDataset::GetRasterBand(2) - Illegal band #

 

ERROR 5: GDALDataset::GetRasterBand(3) - Illegal band #

 

ERROR 5: panDstBands[1] = 2 ... out of range for dataset.

 

I don't want my program to modify the original image, just in case RGB
isn't the correct interpretation, and don't want to have to copy the
image, fix the ColorInterp values, and then warp it to create a third
copy.

 

Is there an option to force RGB interpretation of bands in a Tiff?  Or
do I have to correct the ColorInterp values?

 

Thanks

One problem - where do I find the source-files for the CSharp bindings? 
I have managed to download and compile the source for GDAL but I find no 
  C#-dlls being generated and when I try running the makefile found in 
Swig/Csharp I get an error. Probably because all I've got is a couple of 
makefiles.

Message-ID: <f1v6f0$ugf$1@sea.gmane.org>

I thought  I had the issue solved, that I had managed to compile the 
correct C# bindings and so on.

But, sadly no.
What have I got?
FWtools 3.0
Gdal source, from the latest Trunk
Got the whole SDK-kit from MS, Swig 1.3.31 and Visual Studio Express C++

I manage to compile the whole GDAL-project. I manage to compile C# 
bindings with CSHARP_STATIC_LINKAGE = YES and CSHARP_STATIC_LINKAGE = NO 
but NOT with it commented out.
The compile with CSHARP_STATIC_LINKAGE = NO do not seem to affect the 
result as would be needed. When I try to set up a SpatialReference with 
an EPSG-code I still get a 6.

With CSHARP_STATIC_LINKAGE  commented out the compilation halts when 
creating gdal_wrap.dll:
> LINK : gdal_wrap.dll not found or not built by the last incremental link; perfor
> ming full link
>    Creating library gdal_wrap.lib and object gdal_wrap.exp

> NMAKE : fatal error U1077: '"C:\Program\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\BIN\link.EX

> Stop.

Why is it never as simple? Do I miss something?

Ben,

My understanding is that the core problem is that you are using gdalwarp
and it is failing.  Is that right?  If so, could you provide the gdalinfo
report on the input file, and the exact commandline for gdalwarp that
you are using?

When creating a new TIFF or GeoTIFF file you should be able to use the
PHOTOMETRIC=RGB creation option to force the output file to be marked
as RGB.

Hi Frank,

Hey I think there's a typo here (at least the array size), but you should check it, my eyes are going:)

Hi Frank,

I say your update.  

The size is correct now (64) but your array itself does not contain 64 cells.

Dave,

Good point, I have incorporated your version.  I'm starting to doubt my
cut and paste from the quantization table documents!

Frank,

I kind of checked them, but it will make you  go cross eyed after a while...

I did see that the AC_HUFFVAL and DC_HUFFVAL should have 256 cells and neither one is up to the count.

I needed these though so you saved me a LOT of typing.  So thanks!


Take care,
Dave

Oops!  Some recent changes in gdal have been interfering with this
setting. I've now fixed up the problem in the gdal-trunk and set the
default option to link the C# dll-s dynamically to the gdal libraries.
Please, checkout the latest version and repeat your tests.

It must be noted that after this change the gdal14.dll should be
available to load when running the application or the 'nmake -f
makefile.vc test' target.

Best regards,

Tamas

Message-ID: <4f44d320705101502w746ed004ibd9a819900051528@mail.gmail.com>

Maybe I should ask the question like this.

>From my perusing of the threads, various websites, and those who know alot
more about building various exe's from source, is it fair to say that gdal
builds for current versions of Python (i.e. will there be an installable
.exe version of gdal for Python 2.4) are expected to come out soon after new
releases of GDAL?  Does one of the primary developers for GDAL, the FWTools
community, etc do this? and does it get posted here?  Are there typical time
frames for this?

I would like to be able to use the gdal libraries in Python 2.4 for use in
an application I am writing in Python 2.4 under Windows and the current
version of Numpy.  FWTools contains some of this functionality, but alot of
the multi-band processing comes from writing the gdal and numpy (currently
Numeric) python code through the Python Shell from within FWTools (which
uses Python 2.3).  My main hurdle is I am not too savvy with compiling the
gdal libraries from the source, plus it seems like from other contributers
from this site that it is not real straight forward and/or requires a bunch
of other compiling programs to be installed properly.

>From what I read there seems to be alot of good developments to move forward
and be able to incorporate gdal, numpy, and python.  Regarding compiling
from source, I would like to know if there are any detailed understandable
instructions for compiling the gdal for python 2.4 on windows and using open
source compilers through environments like MinGW.  There seems to be some
quirks with this and hence my reluctance to actually take on this task.

I appreciate any feedback, direction, contacts, sources, etc.

Thank you,
Nate

Nate,

Briefly responding:

  1) Previously the GDAL project did *not* produce binaries to correspond with
     releases.  We are starting work on this, but it does not currently
     include builds with Python.

  2) FWTools is not release oriented - it is tied to the development trunk, and
     is only produced for one Python version - usually not the most recent. It
     is not a product of the GDAL project, but rather a thing of my own.  With
     very little time to work on it, I am generally not very receptive to "won't
     you build it with my version of python/c++ compiler/etc".

  3) I think Mateusz has been recently looking into building GDAL for win32
     with Python 2.4.  Perhaps he will provide a status update, and this will
     make it into the wiki for others who want to build it.

  4) Howard has indicate an interest in producing a python-gdal package
     installer for win32.  This might be for Python 2.4, but will only
     happen as his time and interest permit.

I am interested in making "core binaries" for win32 part of the funded
GDAL maintainer workload, but it isn't at all clear that this will include
Python packages.

Folks,

I declare RFC 12: Improved File Managed passed with +1 support from
Daniel Morissette and myself.  I shall commit this evening.  Plan to do
a clean build if you are working off trunk.

Ok Tamas, it kind of works...

I followed the steps you have described for me and those I found on the 
Wiki:
1: Downloaded latest trunk
2: Compiled  GDAL (how many of the steps must I do? All? Or just the 
first, I guess just the first)
3: Created the C# interface and compiled it.
4: Copied the resulting *_wrap.dlls to Fwtool1.3.0\bin folder
5: Added the new CSharp-dlls to my C# project.
6: Checked that the system path contains FWTools1.3.0\bin folder
If I try running my project after those steps I get an exception when 
trying to call GDAL, whatever *_wrap.dll that is called is not found/not 
possible to load.

When I add the wrap-dlls to the "root" of my C#-project, no apparent change.
When I copy the GDAL-dll to my projects root and include it in the 
build, together with the wrap-dlls, it works!
But is this how it now is supposed to be? I guess I with this setup can 
use GDALs basic function but all the functions which rely on other libs 
(which I have not tested/any knowledge of yet) are not available? For 
example reading and writing of GeoTiff images? (That is possible via the 
C#-bindings?)
For now I think I'm content with coordinate translation but I think I 
want to try how efficient GDAL is to use when importing maps of 
different formats. It would be nice to be able to rip directly from 
GeoTiff (or RIK) with GDAL.

Perhaps a bit OT but:
In basic it boils down to that I have now not a clear idea how to 
distribute the plugin I am building. Demand that FWTools are installed 
or include the nessecary dlls? O well, there is time left to think about 
that.

Again I was a bit to quick when reporting success.
Yes, now I am able to create a SpatialReference from an EPSG code and 
from Proj4 (not tested WKT)
And I am able to create a CoordinaTransform object from those 
spatialreferences.
But I'm not able to perform an actual coordinate transformation, an 
exception is thrown (trying to read or write to  protected (in 
ogr_sharp.dll).

So, again I ask:
Have I missed some step or is it still something in GDAL that doesn't work?

Could you post your example that produces this behaviour? I haven't
found this issue when using a similar test you have mentioned.

Message-ID: <25BE68A4D83DD4438F701DF0311F3F4A401E7A@posthus.blominfo.dk>

Dear list,

 

I have a tiff with a corresponding tfw file that I would like to warp,
but I get the following error:

 

C:\gdalwarp" -of GTiff  2007-007_310_0702.tif 2007-007_310_0702-wrp.tif

Creating output file that is 12632P x 13728L.

Processing input file 2007-007_310_0702.tif.

Using band 4 of source image as alpha.

Using band 4 of destination image as alpha.

Requested

(5081,8284) of size 4611x0 on raster of 11500x7500.

 

The weird part is that if I first gdaltranslate the tiff file into a
jpeg file and copy the world file accordingly, the jpeg file can then be
warped without any problems.

 

The world file is affine (please see below), but isn't that supposed to
work?

 

Contents of tfw file:

-0.0580130855113511

0.0865058993441255

0.0864889964619341

0.0580244710214436

566559.382041782

6287306.42380057

 

I'm on winxp and I have tried fwtools 1.2.3 and 1.3.0.

 

Best regards

Asger

Hello,

is there a way to reproject a shape file of the entire world (eg. http://www.cipotato.org/diva/data/misc/world_adm0.zip) from geographic coordinates (lat/lon) to UTM, using the ogr2ogr utility?
How do I manage the UTM zone?
In order to avoid distorsion, is it possible to suddivide the original file in more lat/lon file, one for every UTM zone?

Thanks a lot.

other than RT90)) but instead it halts at call to TransformPoint.  The

FYI, we submitted a fix in Trac for bug #1415, but it isn't marked as fixed
so I'm also posting here.

Can someone else test the fix?
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1415

The bug also appeared when writing a shapefile with two outer rings touching
each other on one of their starting vertices.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] SHP Files as Layers into a KML File
Message-ID: <002701c793c6$6fc5f340$0100a8c0@Kit1>

Hello,
 
Objective : put several SHP files as different layers - attribute data being
different - into a KML file.
Pb : I cannot -append -update the KML file : "Unable to open existing output
datasource 'out1.kml'".
 
shp2kml.bat file is as follows :
ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f "KML" out1.kml in_1.shp -dsco
NameField=LABEL -nln NewLayerName_1
ogr2ogr -update -append -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f "KML" out1.kml
in_2.shp -dsco NameField=ID -nln NewLayerName_2
ogr2ogr -update -append -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f "KML" out1.kml
in_3.shp -dsco NameField=ID -nln NewLayerName_3
 
What is wrong?
 
The other option, merge several SHP files into 'out.shp' then convert it to
'out2.kml', does not work either.
 
My shp2shp2kml.bat file is as follows :
ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:27572 -f "ESRI Shapefile" out.shp
in_1.shp -nln NewLayerName_1
ogr2ogr -update -append -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:27572 -f "ESRI
Shapefile" out.shp in_2.shp -nln NewLayerName_2
ogr2ogr -update -append -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:27572 -f "ESRI
Shapefile" out.shp in_3.shp -nln NewLayerName_3
ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:4326 -f "KML" out2.kml out.shp
 
ERROR 1: Failed to create file out.shp\NewLayerName_2.shp.
ERROR 4: Failed to open Shapefile 'out.shp\NewLayerName_2.shp'.
ERROR 1: Terminating translation prematurely after failed translation of
layer in_2
etc.
 
Also note that the -nln option does not replace the layer name from 'out' to
'NewLayerName_%' whith the - f "ESRI Shapefile" option while it does with
the -f "KML".
 
Thank you for your help

I my previous letter I've noted that with this setting the *_wrap.dll
will link to the gdal14.dll therefore this dll should also be
available for your application to load.
In my personal opinion if you would distribute your app with this
functionality you might include these dll-s in your package.
Apparently, in the same folder where your application resides.

Most of the functionality of the GDAL/OGR core is exposed to the C#
interface. But indeed many of them might require further dll-s to
include (can normally be found in the FWTools/bin directory). In this
case you might add these dll in your application folder as well.

It depends on the architecture of the application. In fact all of the
dll-s mentioned before should be available to load by the executable
either by adding the location in the PATH environment or copying them
in the application folder.

I sure hope it will.

The easiest thing for Windows users is to have binaries for each 
release, for each recent version of Python (I think the two most recent 
is good enough -- i.e. 2.4 and 2.5). However, barring that, at least is 
should be all set up to build with distutils. That way at least anyone 
with the right compiler can "just build it". Indeed, then they could 
donate the binaries back to the project.

I haven't tried to build it on Windows lately, but it's looking like 
it's not trivial. However, I'm not offering to figure out how to get it 
all to work, so this is just a suggestion!

PS: the package structure for py-gdal really should be re-worked too, 
but that's a different topic.

Ok, thanks for the educating response.

What I am developing is a plugin for SportTracks. In simple terms it 
will act as an alternative source of maps to Google Earth and provide 
translation from/to the maps local projection to WGS84. This will also 
include a mechanism to import the maps into such a format it will be 
easy and fast to read and handle. It will be a local "server" to 
SportTracks providing SportTracks with maps the user has provided.

Some Q's arises from what you have written:
Anyway to single out which DLLs that provide the functions I need?
If I use my own build of gdal will the dll have the necessary bindings 
to the dll-files distributed with FWtool?
But on the other hand I guess I can, in the next release of FWTool, grab 
the whole bunch of dlls and data-files and use them. This solution is  
only for a short  time, I will not have to compile gdal myself after 
FWTool has been upgraded.

And is it necessary to set the system path to make it possible for the 
Csharp bindings to find the gdal dll? It isn't possible to find them by 
a path stored/computed by my code?

Perhaps worth noting, the trunk revision  I have tested with is the one 
after your last edit, i.e. revision 11458.

Frederic,

I have reassigned this to Mateusz to test and apply for the 1.4.2 release.

Mateusz and I spent some time a problem last summer with the recognition
of holes, and I thought at first that this was a similar issue.  Perhaps
it is.  I'm worry that a patch may fix it for one case, and break it for
another, or possibly introduce substantial extra processing delay.  But
ignoring it isn't a great solution either. :-)

Asger,

I have reproduced your problem.  It is due to the warper computing a source
window that is off the input data file.  It automatically gets trimmed to
zero size, and the general purpose code already ignores requests of zero
size.  But the alpha band reader does not ignore these.

I've fixed this in trunk and 1.4 branch, so the fix should be in the next
FWTools release.  In the meantime, if your workaround of going to jpeg is
ok, then use that.  That works because the alpha band is discarded in jpeg
format.

Or build from source of course.

I'll try to do a new fwtools release in the next week or two.

Best regards,

Philippe,

As you can read in the KML driver doc
(http://www.gdal.org/ogr/drv_kml.html)

"OGR has limited support for KML writing and no support for reading KML."

This is the reason of the error you're getting.

It may seems strange because you're trying to *write* KML but not to
read, but if you use -update option, this operation involves
datasource open and read steps.

So, it is not possible to generate single KML file in more than one steps.

As workaround, you could merge shapefiles into single shapefile with
ogr2ogr, if all shapes have the same schema, and then build KML from
single shapefile.

> 'out2.kml', does not work either.

OGR tries to resolve output datasource as a directory but not a file.
If you want to get new layer name (shapefile name), use directory
path as output datasource:

ogr2ogr -s_srs EPSG:27572 -t_srs EPSG:27572 -f "ESRI Shapefile" .
in_1.shp -nln NewLayerName_1

Here, in *current* directory (see the dot), you will get
NewLayerName_1.shp file, generated from in_1.shp.

> Also note that the -nln option does not replace the layer name from 'out' to

Yes, because layer in ESRI Shapefile driver is...name of shapefile,
but if you use shapefile as a datasource, its filename works has two
meanings: datasoruce and layer name. It's not supported to create, edit
and rename the same shapefile in single step.

If you run:

ogrinfo in_1.shp

you will get list of layers including *one* layer named in_1.

If you run:

ogrinfo /path/to/directory/but/not/to/shapefile

you will get list of N layers - names of shapefiles in given directory.

Yes, I've tested Tamas' hacks and they work great for me.
Today, I'll check GDAL official binaries and if they work,
I'll put some notes to the wiki.

Frank,

AFAIU, the dev version is dedicated for developers,
so they are supposed to build their applications in Debug mode.
If a user does not use Visual Studio .NET 2003 (compiler Visual C++
7.1), but he uses ie. VS2005, they he won't be able to run debug builds,
because there are no debug versions of 7.1 CRT DLLs available in the system.

The problem is that all debug libraries shipped with Visual Studio
are not redistributable, and they can not be distributed, AFAIK
according to EULA.

Summarizing, GDAL devel package prepared with VS.NET2003 is unusable
with VS2005.

I'd suppose that similar problem is with Visual Studio .NET 2002 and
6.0, isn't it?

Is this correct, that there are only debug version of binaries
in the dev package and release versions are missing?

I started testing these binaries, and the non-devel version works so
far, but the devel one is unusable for me, as far as I tested.

Richard,

After the ./configure finishes its job, you get the summary.
Check if there is 'internal' word displayed next to libtiff.

I'm sorry but I've not digged into this problem yet.
I was away for longer than a week recently, now I'm back and collecting
deferred tasks.

I'll let you know when I check it, should be soon.

Tomas,

I couldn't find out what is the actual value of your WGS variable in
SpatialReference wgs84 = new SpatialReference(WGS);

In addition CoordinateTransformation(wgs84, wgs84); doesn't seem to do
anything with the coordinate values.
Here is my equivalent code that worked:

int rtX = 1620000;
                 int rtY = 6597000;
                 Gdal.SetConfigOption("GDAL_DATA",@"C:\Program
Files\FWTools1.3.0\data");
                 Gdal.PushFinderLocation(@"C:\Program Files\FWTools1.3.0\data");
                 SpatialReference source = new SpatialReference("");

                 int res = source.ImportFromEPSG(3021);
                 string srcTest, dstTest;
                 source.ExportToWkt(out srcTest);
                 Console.WriteLine(srcTest);
                 SpatialReference wgs84 = new SpatialReference("");
                 wgs84.SetWellKnownGeogCS("WGS84");
                 wgs84.ExportToWkt(out dstTest);
                 Console.WriteLine(dstTest);


                 CoordinateTransformation toWGS = new
CoordinateTransformation(source, wgs84);
                 double[] data = new double[3];
                 toWGS.TransformPoint(data, rtX, rtY, 0);
                 Console.WriteLine(data[0].ToString() + " " +
data[1].ToString());


However your memory corruption issue is somewhat frustrating, do you
have a call stack for this error?

Best regards,

Tamas

I could be completely wrong, but I think that once you decided to do
debugging it doesn't mean that all the DLL that you use should to be
compiled for debugging.

I am using VC2005 to compile and debug in GDAL and I can use  "...Visual
Studio 8\Common7\Tools\Bin\Depends.exe", the "Dependency Walker", and it is
reporting that gdal_translate.exe is using MSVCR80.DLL not MSVCR80D.DLL.

It could be something else.

Ivan

Frank,

AFAIU, the dev version is dedicated for developers,
so they are supposed to build their applications in Debug mode.
If a user does not use Visual Studio .NET 2003 (compiler Visual C++
7.1), but he uses ie. VS2005, they he won't be able to run debug builds,
because there are no debug versions of 7.1 CRT DLLs available in the system.

The problem is that all debug libraries shipped with Visual Studio
are not redistributable, and they can not be distributed, AFAIK
according to EULA.

Summarizing, GDAL devel package prepared with VS.NET2003 is unusable
with VS2005.

I'd suppose that similar problem is with Visual Studio .NET 2002 and
6.0, isn't it?

Is this correct, that there are only debug version of binaries
in the dev package and release versions are missing?

I started testing these binaries, and the non-devel version works so
far, but the devel one is unusable for me, as far as I tested.

It depends on which parts of the functionality is actually used. Most
of the dll-s are loaded dynamically on demand so you cannot use the
Dependency Walker to find out those ones.
You might use a file monitoring tool like SysInternals filemon to see
which dll-s are to be loaded to your executable. FWTools should
contain all of the dependencies of the GDAL/OGR libraries.

Our intention is to isolate the gdal core functionality from the C#
inteface so these dll-s might also be distributed separately. But
indeed you might use that version without compiling it manually. But
if you have a self-propelling application you might want to distribute
all the necessary files along with your package not requiring the user
to go for additional installers.

I would prefer storing those files in a local place available solely
for your application. Should avoid affecting the system settings and
copying the files in the system directory to keep away the dll hell
issues.  Instead, we might want to maintain multiple versions of the
files side by side as much as we can on a particular system. I think
you cannot alter the dll search paths programatically, but in some
cases you might use environment variables (like GDAL_DRIVER_PATH) to
affect the default behaviour.

Tamas

Message-ID: <CC197224AC75CE4DB23F739B16891B866688B8@tikka.haapa.mmm.fi>

Hello,

For some reasons there are two versions of Finnish KKJ parameters hanging around in the projection libraries.  I checked that the situation is the same at least in MS4W and FW Tools Windows packages.  In the files "\FWTools1.2.2\proj_lib\epsg" and "\ms4w\proj\nad\epsg" the definition are like this:
<2393> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=27 +k=1.000000 +x_0=3500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl +units=m +no_defs  <>

In the same directories the corresponding "esri" files include also the towgs84 parameters:
<2393> +proj=tmerc +lat_0=0 +lon_0=27 +k=1.000000 +x_0=3500000 +y_0=0 +ellps=intl +towgs84=-90.7,-106.1,-119.2,4.09,0.218,-1.05,1.37 +units=m +no_defs  no_defs <>

In practice this means that if you re-project something to/from anything else than between the KKJ zones
a) Projections given as epsg:2393 and esri:2393 (or taken from esri .prj file) will lead to different result.
b) If epsg-reference is used the result is always wrong resulting to something like 100-150 metre position error.

I think that the definitions in epsg file should be corrected. Or is there some reason, historical or other, for not including the towgs84 parameters there?

Oh, did I post that version when I tried to go from WGS84 to WGS84. Have 
tried it before and then it changed nothing but still a test if the call 
works.

Tried your code and, no.. I have no idea why it won't work. But my guess 
is something work with compilation of gdal... Perhaps. (some path that 
perhaps needs to be set before compilation?)

Worth mentioning  is perhaps that GDALinfo, the included example, work. 
The include OSRTransform example give the same error as my own code. 
Would have been a bit surprised if not.

It works to allocate the SpatialReferences and the CoordinateTransform, 
it is the call to transform the two points that fails.

As you can see it is runs from a Window Application but that should not 
have anything to do with.
The whole exception. A short translation of the message is, as previous 
said, " A try to read to read or write to protected memory. This 
indicates often that another memory is damaged."

I downloaded the latest trunk and compiled with no error. Set references 
to the four CSharp-dlls and included gdal14.dll and the wrapper dlls in 
the project, all files after compilation in same folder. But when I run 
the code, same error.

And as said before: Environment to compile in is Visual Studio Express 
C++, 2005 environment for developing is Visual Studio Express C# 2005.
Nothing strange.. Version 1.4.1 I have managed to compile and run... But 
of course not EPSG-codes in v 1.4.1

In short:
I can copy, from FWTools, the necessary DLLs and distribute them with my 
application. Just see to that they are stored in the same folder as my 
application.  This I actually did during first tests with GDAL so I know 
it work. Now, during development, it is easier to have a system path to 
where the DLL-s are.

Funny thing  is:
Size of program my plugin is for, around 7 MB.
My plugin, about 100 kB.(one dll)
Included GDAL-dlls, about 30 MB.(can probably isolate the dll-s I need, 
down to  15 MB I think)
Not a problem, just... well

Let this discussion rest until I have a fully operational GDAL to work with.

Folks,

I was doing some test with the GDAL binary distribution and VS2005 crashed
on me.

I recently updated VC2005 SP 1 and my advice for those that us VC2005 is
"Don't!"

In the msdn blogs they are talking about all kind of issues but the bottom
line is that if you follow the steps:

- Open VC2005, 
- Create new Project,  (any type)
- Compile: *Crashs*

Or 

- Open that project again
- Open project property pages
- Open linker
- Open "Command Line: *Crashs*

Good news is that this problem does not affect the makegdal80.sh and the
makefile.vc.

Ivan

I'd like to add myself to the (small?) chorus. It'd be terrific to
have GDAL Windows binaries for recent versions of Python (I agree that
2.4 & 2.5 is good enough). FWTools is great, but stand-alone GDAL
packages that can be integrated with the available Python installation
would provide the most flexibility.

To illustrate... I'm currently developing a package of models of
global river nutrient export to the oceans
(http://www.marine.rutgers.edu/globalnews/); I'm taking the work
previously published by our work group, including implementations in a
set of Excel spreadsheets, and integrating them into one package that
uses Numpy to provide Matlab-like, clean access to the model equations
and data input/output. GIS pre-processing (raster to tables as "zonal"
statistics for watersheds) is done behind the scenes. Our partners
(scientists, new to Python) need to be able to install this package on
their systems, with minimal hassle; on Windows, currently that's just
Python and Numpy, very simple. For the GIS part I chose to use ArcGIS
geoprocessing for expediency. StarSpan
(http://starspan.casil.ucdavis.edu/) unfortunately wasn't an option
b/c it's missing a bit of functionality, is apparently not
straightforward to install on Windows, and seems orphaned at this
time. FWTools on top of a separate Python install would've created too
much complexity and the Numpy bindings are not there yet (?).

Python with Numpy, matplotlib, SciPy, and GDAL (with the "Next Gen"
Numpy bindings), all easy to install: wow, that'd be one sweet,
compelling environment for earth science computing/"geoinformatics"!

Unfortunately, I'm not offering to help create these executables
either. I wish I could send money your way, but I seriously doubt our
funders appreciate the benefits of this sort of support for external
developers that's not very specific to the goals of our project.

Thanks for all the great work. Cheers,

Tomas,

I've eventually created a sample Windows application which executes
the expected code when the button is clicked and the results are
written into a textbox. I've attached the Visual Studio 2005 project
to this mail including the necessary dll-s. You might alter
SetConfigOption PushFinderLocation according to the place of your
FWTools installation.

In my experience when the proj.dll is removed from the application
directory that memory corruption error may arise in that case when the
%PATH% environment variable does not contain a proper location for the
proj.dll in the system.

Best regards,

Tamas

Ahh, it works!
Can it be as simple fact as that the proj.dll in FWTools is named 
proj_fw.dll and the binding in the gdal dll is towards proj.dll. I've 
read about that problem in other posts...

Yes, I guess it is so...

And yes - to the other branch of this thread - only viable solution in 
distribution of my application is to supply the necessary dlls together 
with the application.

Perhaps a small guideline in the wiki about the dlls required is in 
place? And links to where to find them, or compile them?

Thank you big time!
If you are into tracking your running or biking exercises with a GPS 
take a look at SportTracks. In a short time v 2.0 will be released, I 
hope, and soon thereafter my plugin will be released, I also hope.

I'm not saying that VS 2005 doesn't have a few problems (which are far 
outweighed by its good points in my opinion, especially for .NET 
languages), but I've been using VS 2005 Standard with SP1 for several 
months and had no problems like the ones Ivan mentions. If I follow the 
steps described below, I don't get any crashes.

Does this maybe relate to a specific version of VS 2005? e.g Express?

Cheers,

Sy

Thank you folks the support for me to join in the "cabal".
I'm happy to participate in steering the wheel of the most essential
open source project, the "glibc/glibc++ of the geospatial software
world" :-)
I would also happy to see more of the committed developers in this
role in the future.

Best regards,

Tamas

I've issued a ticket for this problem since the memory reference error
is not the convenient way to indicate that the proj.dll is not
loadable. In fact as I've recognized the exceptions are not propagated
to C# for the osr classes. Tomorrow I'll fix this problem so that an
exception will be raised with a more descriptive message ("Failed to
create coordinate transformation" in this case)

Best regards,

Tamas

Sounds like good way too solve this.

Totally OT:
Not a big problem, not my primary e-mail I have used here but still, 
seems like it has already found by some SPAM-idiots. The number of 
e-mails with the correct address has raised a bit. To bad that was what 
I knew would happen.

Ivan,

Unfortunately, it's not so easy.
The SP1 is required for Vista.

Recently, I've been fighting with similar problems:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/fdo-internals/2007-April/001037.html

I uninstalled SP1 what broken my system completely, then I did clean
installation of my Windows XP
and VS2005 again and without SP1 for VS2005, environment for Mobile Devices
is completely broken, project wizards don't work, so I had to install SP1,
again.

Flortunately, 4 weeks ago Microsoft release new version of redistributable
package with runtime components compatible with binaries built
using VS2005 + SP1.

This redistributable package fixes the error you are reporting.
Also, I've not experienced any of crashes you're writing about.

So, in my opinion the correct strategy is to:
- install VS2005
- install SP2 for VS2005
- build software as usual
- ship your software *with*  Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 SP1 Redistributable
Package (x86), see this link:

Hi!

I'm really puzzled. Please can somebody look into this?

I tried to simplify the case a bit. Let's leave out r.out.gdal for a
moment and stick to GDAL commands only. A sample vegcover3.tif is
attached, but you should be able to reproduce the issue with any tiff
out there.

The sample size is 28628 bytes.



Try the following on the sample:

$ gdal_translate vegcover3.tif vegcover3_gt.tif

vegcover3_gt.tif size is 28628 bytes. Identical to input. OK.

$ gdalwarp vegcover3.tif vegcover3_gw.tif

vegcover3_gw.tif size is 36336 bytes. That's 27% bigger than the input!

But why? I can't see a reason there should be any difference. gdalwarp
is supposed to do a raw copy of the input if no switches present; or
isn't it? Maybe I'm just missing something.

Message-ID: <f3b73b7d0705131435u27a9961djb0a191708fb96e63@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I've made the first attempt to add the java related build steps to the
buildbot configuration. Currently I've focused only on the Windows
builders and my effort was eventually successful,
http://buildbot.osgeo.org:8500/

In exchange for this addition I had to move the contents of the
java.opt file into nmake.opt because it was pretty unmanageable in
that fashion. I've added the following section in nmake.opt

# SWIG Java settings
!IFNDEF JAVA_HOME
JAVA_HOME = c:\j2sdk1.4.2_12
!ENDIF
!IFNDEF ANT_HOME
ANT_HOME=c:\programmi\apache-ant-1.7.0
!ENDIF
JAVADOC=$(JAVA_HOME)\bin\javadoc
JAVAC=$(JAVA_HOME)\bin\javac
JAVA=$(JAVA_HOME)\bin\java
JAR=$(JAVA_HOME)\bin\jar
JAVA_INCLUDE=-I$(JAVA_HOME)\include -I$(JAVA_HOME)\include\win32

I've encapsulated the default  JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME parameters into
IFNDEF-s so these values can be given at the nmake command line or in
an external file according to the EXT_NMAKE_OPT settings.
I've also removed all !INCLUDE-s for the java.opt in the Windows makefiles.

I haven't dealt with the GNU builds so far, however java.opt is also
included in the GNU makefile. Howard and I would like to see this
stuff disappearing one day when the configure stuff will be extended
by identifying the JAVA locations. Howard added a ticket for this
change:

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1631

Best regards,

Tamas

Mateusz,

I am using XP and I am not shipping any executable based on VS2005, so I
guess it would be less trouble to just remove and re-install it without SP1.

Thanks for the info,

Ivan

Hello, you would certainly want to subdivide the original file into the 
zones you wanted to convert to UTM.

You would also want to remove the extreme north and south regions from 
the longlat data as Mercator is not defined at the poles.

Cheers, Mike.

Dear Frank,

Hi,

I try to use the OGR's library in Csharp and the GEOS support but I have 2
problems. I'm using the "gdal-svn-trunk-2007.05.09".

1) With the objects "OSGEO.OGR.Geometry" when I use the method "Contains" it
turns over me an error "GEOS support not enabled". However I have
uncommented the support GEOS in the file "nmake.opt" and the compilation
return no error.

GEOS_CFLAGS = -IE:\Mapserver\geos-2.2.3\source/capi -DHAVE_GEOS
GEOS_LIB     = E:\Mapserver\geos-2.2.3\source/geos_c_i.lib

When I use on the same object the method "Intersect" it seems work. 

2) Can I use in csharp this method: "Ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt".

Best Regards

PIERRET Jean michel

Maciek,

gdalwarp uses very different library interfaces and io strategies from
gdal_translate.  So in some circumstances the output may differ.

On careful review, the difference in the file in question is because
gdal_translate uses the TIFFWriteScanline() interface to write the output
file from within GTiffDataset::CreateCopy(), and this only writes as much
of the final 'strip' of the file as is required to complete image area.
But gdalwarp goes through the blockio interface which writes the complete
final strip, even the portion that falls off the end of the file.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <22ea73180705141058o61ae5d41h93d5b55a2b44d7a4@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,
I'm working on my final university thesis and I worked on the synergy
between grass63 and mysql. In particular I also developed a patch for gdal
that let it open raster map files directly from a mysql db (assumed that
files are stored in mediumblob columns, for example).
I'd like to know if this patch could be of any interest to gdal community
and if chances are that the code could be accepted as a contribution in the
source tree (I could also modify and optimize the code starting from any
feedback, too).
Practically what can be done with this patch is, for example:

gdal_translate
MYSQL:test,user=root,password=,host=localhost,port=3306,table=maps,file_name=a_map.dt1

That's really the only sane way to build extensions for Python anyway.

It sure would, and we're pretty darn close. I've not had reason to use 
gdal+python lately, but I think I may soon, so I'll dig into what it 
takes then.

By the way, what is the status of the NG bindings, anyway? Are they 
numpy compatible and ready-to-go?

Emanuele,

I'm concerned that this is a rather specialized driver, and that folks might
actually want to use rasters from MySQL in a variety of other ways as well.
I would be happy to have the driver put in "spike" (an experimental area) in
subversion, but I'm not yet all that comfortable that this makes sense as
*the* mysql raster driver for GDAL.

Best regards,

Message-ID: <fa2ac0580705141451y7e7a0526n6f563a039283d174@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have run the following gdalwarp command

EPSG:" + EPSG_wgs84 + " -of HFA " + " -q " + inputFiles + " " + outputFile

wgs84 and it works fine, but it takes 22:47 hours to generate the 52.89 GB
mosaic.
Does anyone have any suggestions on how to speed up the gdalwarp process.  I
have noticed that the 4 processor server is only being utilized between
14-26% across all 4 processors.  Is their a way to force a higher
utilization of these processors?  I have in past tried to run 2 gdalwarp
jobs simultaneously and I have noticed that it takes them much longer
compared to the total time when running serially (meaning one after the
other).

John -

 

Are the input and output files on the same disk subsystem, and what kind
of disk(s) is involved?

 

gdalwarp will run as a single task, so if it uses 1 processor 100% of
the time you'll see 25% utilization.  If you run two gdalwarp jobs at
the same time, using the same disks, you can very easily cause disk
thrashing and bog the whole process down, so it's not surprising to find
two jobs in parallel takes more than two jobs run serially.

 

If possible, have the input and output files on different disks, and
avoid having read/write activity on the same disk or more than one job
writing to the same disk.

It looks like you should be able to (if you have a network) dupe the 
input file to each machine, run a copy of gdalwarp on each machine with 
custom -te params (-ts might vary on the last block), and then use 
gdal_merge.py to assemble the results.

There's also gdalwarp's -multi option, which will use two threads 
instead of one per gdalwarp instance.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] OCI support for Oracle 9i
Message-ID: <20070515110247.69c5a374@localhost.localdomain>

Hi, 

I am trying to build gdal 1.4.1 with OCI support but with no success. The
database is an oracle 9i. In the configure script I provide:

--with-oci=/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome \
--with-oci-lib=/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/lib

There are two problems:

a) checking for Oracle OCI headers in /usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/public

During configuration the header files are assumed to be in rdbms/public:
... checking for Oracle OCI headers in
/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/public

but in my oracle installation the header files are located in /rdbms/demo/, so I
have to copy them. Can I somehow add:

--with-oci-include='/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/public /usr/lib/oracle/9
.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/demo' ?

b) checking for Oracle OCI libraries in /usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/lib

here I get following error message that -lnnz10 is missing:

#configure:26066: checking for Oracle OCI libraries in
#/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/lib configure:26097: g++ -o conftest -g -O2

#configure: failed program was:

#|                 /* confdefs.h.  */

I haven't found anything about it in other mailings, so I hope someone can give
me a hint, how I can manage to get oracle support for current gdal 1.4.1. I
worked with version 1.3.2 before and there I have oci support with the same
configuration.

 Otto

Otto,

You should use

--with-oci

*or* pair of options

--with-oci-include
--with-oci-lib

The single --with-oci is equivalent to ORACLE_HOME environment,
but it may not work well with older Oracle versions, because there were
some changes in structure of installation directory.

So, try to use the two latter options.

Yes, you should use --with-oci-include.

Could you give me list of libraries in your directory
/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/lib

yes, but the header files are in two folders - so I use:

--with-oci-include='/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/public \
/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/demo' 

Problem here: it only looks into the first of the two folders. The oci.h header
is in /usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/demo. Do I have to use another
syntax? I tried with different quotation marks without success.

-> checking for Oracle OCI headers in /usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/public
/usr/lib/oracle/9.2.0/OraHome/rdbms/demo
... #error Oracle oci.h header not found

Philippe,

I think it should be easy to write Python script that will get a bunch
of KML files, each generated from a shapefile, and to some merging.

Unfortunately, I don't have any easier solution to suggest, for now.

Hi.

 

Is there any way I can get OGR pre-compiled with Oracle Spatial support?

 

If not, is there a simple recipe that I can follow to compile OGR?

 

The only dev tool I have is C# express.

 

Thanks,

Duarte Carreira

Ivan,

It's important for base framework libraries: C and C++.

Yes, if you compile with VC++ 2005, then you use msvcr80.dll and
msvcr80d.dll.

Here is the situation I'm trying to describe:

http://mateusz.loskot.net/tmp/gdal-dev-misisng-71d.png

1. gdal14.dll built with Visual C++ 7.1, as debug
2. read.exe built with Visual C++ 8.0, as debug
3. gdal14.dll requires debug versions of 7.1 runtime libraries which are
missing if you don't have Visual C++ 7.1 installed

Cheers

Duarte,

In theory we just need someone with Visual Studio 2003 (aka VC7.1) and
Oracle on the same system who could build the driver as a plugin against
the already published GDAL/OGR 1.4.1 binaries.

I have VC7.1, but I don't have Oracle on the same system, and I'm a bit
loath to screw around installing it.  Perhaps there is a light oracle
"client only" install I could be doing?

I think Mateusz has Oracle, but VC8.

Possibly Howard might be interested?

Best regards,

Subject: [Gdal-dev] creating tiles from rasters using gdal
Message-ID: <1279B630-2F84-4EED-A6A6-A0BC722EF0EC@dmsolutions.ca>

Hi all ...

I need to turn some rasters (png and tiff) into tiles for use in a  
tiled map application.  For various reasons, these rasters are not  
georeferenced and I don't need them to be.

What I have done is create a shell script with a couple of loops that  
calls gdal_translate to pick out 256x256 tiles and save them into the  
directory structure that I need (Paul Ramsey's TMS structure in this  
case).  Here is the command that I am invoking for each tile:

gdal_translate -quiet -of "PNG" -outsize 256 256 -srcwin $l $t 256  
256 $src ../tiles/1.0.0/"$tileset"/"$scale_number"/"$nCol"/"$y"".png"

where $l and $t are determined from the current row/col * 256, $src  
is the input raster, $tileset and $scale_number are used for  
subdirectories, $nCol is the current column and $y is the inverse of  
the current row (need to adjust between pixel and geographic space  
for the client)

This works perfectly but becomes increasingly slow - I'm processing  
6804 tiles out of a raster that is 21504 x 20736 pixels, the first  
100 or so were fast but now it is down to 3-4 secs per tile (I'm at  
4200 tiles so far).

How can I improve performance?  Is there an existing utility that  
will do something like this or do I need to roll my own version of  
gdal_translate?

Cheers

Paul

Hi and thanks for your fast reply,

I'm concerned that this is a rather specialized driver, and that folks might

 Can you give me an example? I can't imagine (I'm not so expert in gis maps)
how a raster map could be stored in a mysql db other than the one of storing
the whole file in a blob...

I would be happy to have the driver put in "spike" (an experimental area) in

How should I do that? And how could this first "idea" of driver be improved?
I could work on it if only I'd have some feedback about the direction it
should go and if I'm pretty sure that it won't be wasted time!

Mateusz,

No, the gdalwin32dev141.zip package also include gdal_i.lib which is
the release build stub library corresponding to gdal14.dll, the release
DLL distributed as part of gdalwin32exe141.zip.

My understanding then is that folks with VS2005 cannot use the *debug*
version of GDAL, but can still build their application with debug and
use the release version of GDAL.  The downside of course is that they
can't debug into GDAL.

Basically then the gdal_iD.lib and gdal14d.dll are extras for folks
who happen to have VS2003.  Others will basically have to use the
release version of GDAL even if they are building their own apps with
debug.  If they really want to debug into GDAL then they will need to
build it themselves.

In fact, when we distribute plugins they will need to be specifically
for a release or debug build I imagine.  Perhaps it would be simpliest
if I just omit any debug version of stuff from the package?  That way
folks won't accidentally try to use it with the wrong version of the
compiler, or run into problems with plugins not working in debug.

Emauele,

Well, another approach is to treat a large image as a set of tiles.  So
a table might represent the image, and each row is a tile with other
columns holding the bounds for instance.

If you submit the driver via Trac, I can commit it on the spike.

Then I'd encourage you to write up a topic about the driver in the wiki
for folks to look at if they want to try it.  I'll add a bit of info there
on how to pull it out of spike into an existing build.  Likely we would
handle it as a plugin.

Yes, I believe that would be good.
If someone will want to debug GDAL, we can assume he is
able to build GDAL on his own, what seems to be the best option for very
powered users.

Paul,

If the source raster is PNG then the problem is likely due to the file
having to be decompressed from the beginning each time you process a tile.
For the first row of tiles this isn't bad, but the further you go down the
big file, the more of the png has to be decompressed on each run.

If you can, just reprocess the big images into internally tiled TIFFs once
before running the tiling script.

Alternatively, you could accomplish the tiling using a script that keeps the
input file open.  This would help because the in memory caching would prefer
a lot of unnecessary re-decompressing.

if you don't need them geo-referenced, then you can use regular old 
image processing tools. ImageMagick, for instance, should be able to do 
that just fine.

There was a note about that on list list not too long ago.

I'd agree with this.  Anyone debugging under Windows is most likely setup to
build on their own.

I'm curious... How many of you who debug under Windows use the makefiles
that come with GDAL, and how many of you use Visual Studio Project files
(your own or the VTP ones)?

- I use my own VS Solution and Project Files to build and debug.

Craig

Frank,

That was exactly what I was trying to prove when I got into trouble with
VC2005 SP1. Have you tested it? Can you have your application in VC2005 in
debugging mode using the gdalwinexe141 distribution that comes with:
msvcp71.dll and msvcr71.dll? 

Best regards,

Ivan

Mateusz,

No, the gdalwin32dev141.zip package also include gdal_i.lib which is
the release build stub library corresponding to gdal14.dll, the release
DLL distributed as part of gdalwin32exe141.zip.

My understanding then is that folks with VS2005 cannot use the *debug*
version of GDAL, but can still build their application with debug and
use the release version of GDAL.  The downside of course is that they
can't debug into GDAL.

Basically then the gdal_iD.lib and gdal14d.dll are extras for folks
who happen to have VS2003.  Others will basically have to use the

build it themselves.

if I just omit any debug version of stuff from the package?  That way

Personally I've always used the makefile.vc approach. I find that 
fine-grained configuration of the build is much easier by editing 
nmake.opt, rather than editing project files. I've never had any real 
problems doing it that way though if I was doing more serious GDAL 
development under windows (rather than just building release version of 
the GDAL libraries) I would prefer project files.

A while back someone suggested setting up a cmake build and I'd love to 
see that. In addition to its cross-platform abilities (e.g. VS 2003 vs 
VS 2005 vs gcc), cmake seems offers easy fine-grained configuration, but 
generates normal looking VS project files on windows. If only I had the 
time...

Cheers,

Sy

Frank,

Thanks much for your answer! I'm so glad the hear this is not a data
corruption issue or whatsoever. 

However, wouldn't you consider it a missfeature that gdalwarp creates circa
25% bigger GeoTIFFs than gdal_translate does? The bigger deal it is the
bigger is the input dataset.  For me it is quite a difference whether I get
a 3 GB or 4 GB raster. Do you think gdalwarp could follow gdal_translate in
this regard? If possible of course.

Best,
Maciek

Maciek,

The particular problem I saw in the case I analysed should actually get
less and less significant as the dataset gets larger.  If you are seeing
much larger files for big files then a different issue is likely to
be coming into play.

Ivan,

I haven't tried it.  Mateusz tried it successfully with VC2005 (I'm not sure
if it was SP1 or not).

Message-ID: <a40be0e10705160533r6a4136eex249145c383e7f37e@mail.gmail.com>

I've been working on a graduate school software engineering project,
and it now has a hyperspectral image viewing mode using GDAL to
support the multitude of hyperspectral image formats.  (Without GDAL
it only supports uncompressed images with ENVI headers.)

Currently, it just displays images, shows spectra and profiles, and
has some basic image enhancement commands.  I intend to continue to
develop it as a platform for algorithm testing, and pie-in-the-sky as
a replacement for ENVI.  ENVI is a very capable analysis tool, but to
extend it you need to use the IDL language, which is quite a bit less
than my favorite thing ever.

peppy is written in Python using the ng-python bindings of GDAL, and
requires wxPython, numpy, and scipy.

Comments welcome!

Message-ID: <fa2ac0580705160621s65b2333dt2cbbcfd96b5c1d47@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

When running the following command:

gdalwarp.exe -srcnodata "0 0 0" -dstnodata "0 0 1" -rc -s_srs EPSG:26913
-t_srs EPSG:26913 -co tiled=yes -q -of hfa inputfile outputfile

I get the following error:

ERROR 6: SetNoDataValue() not supported for this dataset.

Which means that the remapping from "0 0 0" to "0 0 1" can't be performed.
When looking at the erdas imagine file after processing it appears to be
processed correctly except that the remapping does not occur.  This is not a
problem for geotiff files, but I can't use geotiffs for mosaics that are
over 4 gb in size.  Are their any alternatives?  Will I be able to mosaic
and remap to the big Tiff format when it comes out.

Thanks,

	Performance in Batch Mode
Message-ID: <5AC0F51A926CD442BC08D55DA7DAB1D406267AA1@3mxma1r.hpi.uni-potsdam.de>

Hi!

I would like to announce the new RFC 13:
<http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc13_createfeatures>

I would like to add some new methods to OGRLayer for "batched"
inserting/updating/deleting features. These virtual methods allow OGR
drivers to implement optimized handling of these batched operations
(e.g. resulting in a performance boost).

For example, I was able to improve the "batched insertion" scenario for
the MySQL driver from ~40 features per second to something about
800-1.500 features per second; for layers with >=50.000 features (with
and wihtout geometry)...

Any further comments and suggestions are wellcome.

What is the procedure to start voting on that?

Best regards,
    Kosta

Kosta,

I presume the optimization in the mysql driver was accomplished by doing
all the features in a single CreateFeatures() call as a single transaction.
Is that right?

There are other mechanisms to accomplish this - based on the OGR transaction
semantics.  For instance, I think the postgres and oracle drivers implement
ogr transaction semantics and can do a bunch of CreateFeature() calls in
a single transaction.  The ogr2ogr program already defaults to doing feature
creation in groups of 200 by default, with transaction semantics around this.

On the other hand, the transaction semantics are quite complicated to
implement properly in drivers, which is why I suspect they haven't been
done in the MySQL driver.  So if we were to proceed with this RFC I think
it would be because it provides a simplier approach to grouping create
features than the transaction semantics.

But because this introduces an extra interface and the related complexity
I'm hesitant to support it when there is another way to accomplish the
same thing.

One other small concern.  I think it can be inconvenient to implement
swig wrappers for interfaces taking arrays of objects.  Can any of the
swig folks comment on this?

> What is the procedure to start voting on that?

Normal practice would be to allow some discussion and revision and then to
call a formal motion to adopt the RFC, which would start the 2 business day
voting period.  You would need +1's from at least two GDAL PSC members and
no objections (-1's) to pass the RFC.

Hi,

I agree in the purpose of the RFC. However it seems that this
implementation brings in some new elements in the C++ interface and
further requirements of the various drivers to implement these
functions. Hopefully not the mysql is the only driver that would
implement this functionality.

Many people use the various SWIG-ged language APIs instead of the
C/C++ interface. So we should also consider to support these API-s
with any new additions as well. In this regard implementing typemaps
for object arrays in not too straightforward and we should eventually
reconstuct the array iterating through the elements one by one. It
would certainly bring in additional delays with the completion of the
overall implementation.
To support the SWIG interfaces you should also represent these
function at the GDAL/OGR C API.

I would propose you to examine the option of providing this
functionality by using the existing API with caching the various
feature creations / additions / deletions at the provider. These
changes could be propagated to the datastore in batch using the
existing transaction mechanism. I'm sure that this behaviour have
already been implemented in various providers.

Best regards,

Tamas

I was not aware that OGR had this transaction mechanism, but I agree 
with Frank that it would be preferable to it if possible instead of 
adding another mechanism to do the same thing.

Duarte,

With your help I have prepared an OCI plugin for GDAL 1.4.x:

   http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/win32/gdalwin32oci141.zip

It is designed to unpack on top of gdalwin32exe141.zip but you should
be able to use it with any VC7.1 built GDAL 1.4.x.  It uses the Oracle
Instant Client 10.2 libraries that you pointed me to.

I'd appreciate feedback on whether it works for you.

Best regards,

Daniel,

I suspect that you don't know about the transaction mechanism because it
is only lightly supported and advertised.  In fact, I suspect that the approach
as it currently stands is a bit poorly thought out.  For instance, transactions
are datasource wide, rather than per-layer which causes problems in some
circumstances.  I believe there are substantial patches for the postgres
driver to address flaws in the transaction implementation there that I'm afraid
to apply for fear of what else it might break.

And very few providers (even RDBMS providers) bother to implement the
transaction semantics.

Folks,

It turns out the oracle plugin was accidentally built against the debug
version.  Per the discussions previously (Mateusz, etc) I have decided to
drop debug support out of the binaries package to simplify things and
avoid problems like this one.

I have reuploaded the exe, dev and oci packages in:

   http://download.osgeo.org/gdal/win32

Please let me know if anyone runs into problems.

Best regards,

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Geo->local coordinate transformation
Message-ID: <2cd3193b0705161124p2de1459bl1e4fed1f0b09c1b0@mail.gmail.com>

I have a project where I'm working with geographic raster images and I need
to be able to do distance calculations between two points in the image.

I was thinking I could create a local SRS using a corner of the raster as
the origin, then just transform from the lat/lon coordinates to the local
coordinates (which would just be distance from the corner in meters) to make
my calculations the most accurate. But I'm not sure if this is possible with
OGRSpatialReference. Can anyone tell me how I could create a local
OGRSpatialReference object with the origin of my choosing? Or maybe there's
an easier way to do what I'm looking for.

Thanks in advance,

Kevin Bentley

Kevin,

Assuming your image size is not too large (in the sense of geographic
area covered, not file size), you can define a local projected coordinate
system using perhaps the center of the image as the central meridian and
reference point.  Then convert locations into this SRS and compute
cartesian distances.

I'm not really sure what the best choice of projected coordinate system
would be, but I think for a fairly small area Orthographic would be
reasonably well behaved, even if you go near the poles.

So you could create an OGRSpatialReference in C++ something like:

   OGRSpatialReference oOrtho;

   oOrtho.SetOS( long_center, lat_center, 0, 0 );
   oOrtho.SetWellKnownGeogCS( "WGS84" );

Then you could create one for your lat/long coordinates:

   OGRSpatialReference oWGS84;

   oWGS84.SetWellKnownGeogCS( "WGS84" );

Then create a transformer.
   OGRCoordinateTransformation *poTransformer =
      OGRCreateCoordinateTransformation( &oWGS84, &oOrtho );

And transform points like:

   double x = -117.0, y = 33.0, z = 0;

   poTransformer->Transform( 1, &x, &y, &z );

I hope this is helpful.

Best regards,

Gdalinfo does not report a coordinate system when used with MrSid
landsat images.  Is this a known issue?  It does report reference system
from some other MrSid rasters that I use.  Is there a work around?

Bruce,

Does mrsidinfo report a coordinate system for these files?  Is there any
reason to believe they have a coordinate system defined?

Clay,

NASA's GeoCover MrSID Landsat image mosaics do not have information on the coordinate system or datum embeded in the MrSID image header.  The NASA GeoCover Landsat mosaics are in UTM WGS84.  In your case, your image is in UTM, WGS84, Zone 17 North.

If you really need to add this info into the MrSID image header, you need to use the software GeoExpress from LizardTech to do it.  NASA's GeoCover MrSID images are in the MG2 MrSID format.  You would use GeoExpress to convert it from MG2 to MG3 and specify the coordinate system and datum for the MG3 output image.

If you do not have GeoExpress, you can download a trial version at LizardTech''s web site (www.lizardtech.com).

Hope it helps

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Max no of layers in OGR shapefile driver
Message-ID: <EE7CF6B5-B253-4889-9AA8-B7308A6BD3F2@cs.otago.ac.nz>

Hi,

I'm working with OGR and a set of 280 shapefiles each representing a  
layer. I find I can open the first 84 shapefiles and all the rest  
return error code 4 Error opening file). It doesn't seem to matter  
which particular 84 files - I can't open any more than that. The  
shapefiles are all one directory, along with their .dbf, .shx  
and .qix files. I've looked at the source for the shapefile driver  
and I can't see any limits built in there, and as far as I'm aware  
the operating system's limit is 12500 open files (per process). The  
OS is OS X.

I have loaded all the shapefiles into postgis as an experiment and I  
can read all the layers from there just fine, albeit slowly.

I realise I'm probably overlooking something obvious here, but any  
hints would be very much appreciated.

Regards,
Dave Robertson

Message-ID: <EA53646512D0ED48AC1673034B861EE0017EAB7F@thuja>

Apologies for what is likely a newbie question, but the documentation
for gdal.Band.ReadRaster() shows this parameter list:

def ReadRaster(*args, **kwargs):
        """
        ReadRaster(self, int xoff, int yoff, int xsize, int ysize, int
buf_len, 
            int buf_xsize=0, int buf_ysize=0, int buf_type=0) -> CPLErr
        """
        return _gdal.Band_ReadRaster(*args, **kwargs)

However, in all the examples I have seen, it looks like the "buf_len"
parameter is not given, e.g. (from
http://www.gdal.org/gdal_tutorial.html):

scanline = band.ReadRaster( 0, 0, band.XSize, 1, band.XSize, 1,
GDT_Float32 )

Can someone clarify the discrepancy?

Subject: [Gdal-dev] csharp spatialreference normalization.....problem?
Message-ID: <10657074.post@talk.nabble.com>


I'm programming in Visual Basic 2005 Express using the csharp dll's
distributed with FWTools 1.3.1.

I have a geotiff that produces the following output, in part, from gdalinfo:

PROJCS["NAD83 Arkansas State Planes, Northern Zone, US Foot",
    GEOGCS["NAD83",
        DATUM["North_American_Datum_1983",
            SPHEROID["GRS 1980",6378137,298.2572221010002,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","7019"]],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","6269"]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],
        UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","4269"]],
    PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic_2SP"],
    PARAMETER["standard_parallel_1",36.2333333333333],

    PARAMETER["central_meridian",-92],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",1312333.2916615],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
    UNIT["US survey foot",0.3048006096012192,
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","9003"]]]
Origin = (673800.376251435020000,634598.712631960050000)
Pixel Size = (1.000032169999991,-1.000116180000028)

As the gdalinfo output shows, the image is projected in a state plane
coordinate system with 
US Survey Feet as the linear units. Also, the geotransform parameters are
also in US Survey Feet.

In Visual Basic, using the csharp dlls, when I obtain a spatial reference to
this same file by invoking
Dim srcSrs As New OSGeo.OGR.SpatialReference(ds.GetProjection()) 
I get the following prettywkt output:

PROJCS["NAD83 Arkansas State Planes, Northern Zone, US Foot",
    GEOGCS["NAD83",
        DATUM["North_American_Datum_1983",
            SPHEROID["GRS 1980",6378137,298.2572221010002,
                AUTHORITY["EPSG","7019"]],
            AUTHORITY["EPSG","6269"]],
        PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],
        UNIT["degree",0.0174532925199433],
        AUTHORITY["EPSG","4269"]],
    PROJECTION["Lambert_Conformal_Conic_2SP"],
    PARAMETER["standard_parallel_1",36.2333333333333],
    PARAMETER["standard_parallel_2",34.9333333333333],
    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",34.3333333333333],
    PARAMETER["central_meridian",-92],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",399999.9872983998],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",0],
    UNIT["unknown",1]]

Apparently, the spatial refence is getting normalized from US Survey feet to
meters, but the geotransform 
parameters I subsequently get from the image remain in US Survey feet.  If I
get the LinearUnitsName from 
the spatial reference, all it returns is "unknown."  So I have a disconnect
between the linear units of the normalized spatial reference and the linear
units of the geotransform.

Am I overlooking something or is this problem in that  the csharp procedures
work differently from the C++ counterparts? Is there a way to force the
csharp Get.Projection or spatialreference assignment procedures to not
normalize?

Thanks for your help.

Tim,

I'm quite surprised at this situation, and I can't think of any coherent
reason why this would be happening.  Well, I guess there must be some
difference in the approach used to lookup the PCS code from the geotiff.

You might want to ensure that all the environment variables set by
the FWTools environment setting script are set in your global environment
and see if the c# interface then produces the same results.  If so, then
we know it has something to do with searching for supporting files.

Best regards,

Matt,

I'm not sure where these doc strings come from, but I believe that the
python bindings determine the buf_len internally and so it is not passed
in as a regular argument (as it would be in C).

Dave,

I believe you are running into a problem with maximum number of files that
can be open at once for a process.  Some unix systems let you raise this
with the limit or ulimit command.  I've never looked into it on OS X.

Bruce,

GDAL can read the .aux files for coordinate system information *if* you
define the GDAL_PAM_ENABLED config/environment variable to ON.  We should
really consider turning on .aux reading by default for GDAL/OGR 1.5.0.

Yes, I think what happens is the C function needs a string and its  
length, but we use a typemap to take in the Python string and turn it  
into a string and a length.  SWIG generates its docstring using the  
method signature before the typemap is applied, which has buf_len in  
there.

I would also add that I have figured out a slightly messy but useful  
method for extracting the docstrings out of doxygen and applying them  
in the Python SWIG bindings (Python has the best internal doc support  
of the SWIG languages, I think).  I have generated and committed  
these docstrings for OGR, but haven't done so yet for GDAL or OSR.   
So, hopefully in the near future, the docstring for that method will  
just be a copy of the C/C++ docs.  There will obviously still be some  
disconnects, but the docs that have been written are generally more  
useful than having only the default stuff that SWIG generates.

Frank:

Thanks for your suggestion.  The first thing I do in the program I'm writing
is to programatically set all but the PYTHONPATH environment variables with
Visual Basic 2005 Express Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable() functions. 
But, I also tried your suggestion and set the environonment variables
directly on my machine through the Windows Control Panel.  When this is
done, things work as they should....the US Survey feet are correctly shown
in the spatial reference.  So I guess I'm not correctly understanding the
Visual Basic Environment.SetEnvironmentVariable() function although it seems
to be working....calls to Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PROJ_LIB") etc
return the correct paths.

Thanks for you help.

Otto,

Unfortunately, this hack won't work.

I'm a little surprised that ./configure can not detect your headers.
Some time ago, I fixed support for older Oracle versions in the
./configure and m4/ax_oracle_oci.m4 macro


Here, you can see that for older Oracle, headers are checked in two
locations:

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/m4/ax_oracle_oci.m4#L102
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/m4/ax_oracle_oci.m4#L175

ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/public
and
ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/demo

AFAIR, some users confirmed that this fix works.

>>> b) checking for Oracle OCI libraries in

>>> 
>>> here I get following error message that -lnnz10 is missing:

>>> collect2: ld returned 1 exit status


Older Oracle versions does not have nnz10 library.
As I see in your files list, you don't have it indeed.

Although, this issue seems to be also filtered in the ./configure script:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/browser/trunk/gdal/m4/ax_oracle_oci.m4#L263

If version is >=10.x, then add -lnnz10, otherwise not.


I suppose there may be two issues:
1) problem with detecting version of Oracle
2) the ./configure script has not been regenerated (by ./autogen.sh)
before releasing, so changes in the ax_oracle_oci.m4 macro are not
present there

Otto, would it be possible for you to try GDAL from SVN ?
Just for this issue, to test if SVN works for older Oracle.

Unfortunately, I have only access to Oracle 10g so it's very hard to
catch all subtle differences.

Thanks for your help!

Cheers

Dave,

ADAIR, OSX9 used very low number of open files per process (64).
See this FAQ, error code 24:

http://www.osxfaq.com/man/2/intro.ws

When you open 280 shapefiles, you get (not counting .prj) 280 * 3 number
of open files, so I suppose you hit beyond the limit
which I *suppose* is ~255 per process, in newer OSX versions.

What means slowly?
Do you use spatial index, GiST ?

Message-ID: <C1E68D9F9D8BDD46AEDBFE23D29F3A7302BA1DA7@Navajo.BLACKBIRD.BLACKBIRDTECH.COM>

I'm trying to convert a 16bpp, 4 band NITF image into a GeoTiff and have
not been able to figure out the arguments necessary to properly convert
it.  Accompanying the NITF image is a text description of the image,
which contains (parts edited out with <snip> and </snip> for brevity:

When I try to convert it with gdal_translate, the resulting TIF file is
not viewable.  The image produced contains 1 pixel wide bands of various
colors, that from a 1x zoom level appear to be gray.  The output of
tiffinfo on this GeoTiff file produces the following:

Nice! Is there any way to grab the build results, that is, all
the dlls and jars? At the moment I'm unable to build gdal
due to a change in geomedia driver that made the code incompatible
with vc++ 6.0 (well, it may have been fixed lately, haven't checked).

Afaik the standard way to declare java location is really JAVA_HOME.
I don't know of any other.

We have no VC6 buildslaves configured currently so I cannot confirm
whether it builds on this compiler or not. The buildbot currently
contains VC71 and VC80 builders. The latter is configured to produce
64 bit binaries.
IIRC Mateusz is planning to make the results available to download,
but this option haven't
been realized yet.

I have no doubts about it. However for the windows builds it's more
convenient to provide this setting in a common configuration file
(that is the nmake.opt) than altering many other files in different
places. It is pretty unmanageable from the buildbot's perspective.

Do we have a 'make test' functionality for the java builds?

Best regards,

Tamas

John,

It is not obvious to me why this wouldn't have worked.  Could you supply
a gdalinfo report for the input file?  What were you using to view the
resulting TIFF files?

Actually, I'd suggest adding -co INTERLEAVE=PIXEL to your gdal_translate
command on the chance your tiff viewer does not support "SEPARATE" organized
TIFF files.

If the problem turns out to be the nitf reading, another step is to run
the nitfdump utility against the nitf file for more details info.  This
utility can be manually built by cd'ing into the gdal/frmts/nitf directory
in the source tree and doing "nmake /f makefile.vc nitfdump.exe" or
"make nitfdump" depending on platform.

Best regards,

John,

It is not obvious to me why this wouldn't have worked.  Could you supply
a gdalinfo report for the input file?  What were you using to view the
resulting TIFF files?

Actually, I'd suggest adding -co INTERLEAVE=PIXEL to your gdal_translate
command on the chance your tiff viewer does not support "SEPARATE"
organized
TIFF files.

If the problem turns out to be the nitf reading, another step is to run
the nitfdump utility against the nitf file for more details info.  This
utility can be manually built by cd'ing into the gdal/frmts/nitf
directory
in the source tree and doing "nmake /f makefile.vc nitfdump.exe" or
"make nitfdump" depending on platform.

Best regards,

Heh, unfortunately not.
Plus, the layout of the java binding sources is "peculiar" to say
the least (at least by java standards). Ideally we should have
a set of JUnit tests for the java bindings.

Hi list,
since I am mainly concerned in the java bindings (as well as aaime is) I
would like to give a couple of suggestions which may help or not.
1>When installing java  people are supposed to define a JAVA_HOME env
variable hence by default I would suggest to the Java guys to not set the
JAVA_HOME variable in java.opt and run the following command twhen
generating the bindings:

nmake /F  makefile.vc /E java

The /E will pick up the correct JAVA_HOME env var from wherever it is.

2>99% Of people that intall ant, usually put it in the path. Hence it is
unnecessary most part of the time to define an ANT_HOME variable as in
java.opt. I would suggest to make the definition of the ANT_HOME variable
optional in the java.opt file just run ant by default.

3>I would suggest to provide a maven descriptor along with the ant one (it
would pretty easy to add it) and to upload the releveant jar on some public
maven repository so that people can get it directly from there.

Again, these are just some advice from a Java programmer, so don't be too
hard on me :-).

Ciao,
Simone.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] IMAGE_STRUCTURE metadata - rfc discussion
Message-ID: <464D008A.7040209@pobox.com>


Folks,

I've started drafting an RFC to formalize handling of metadata about
image structure in the IMAGE_STRUCTURE domain.  It is at:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc14_imagestructure

My concrete needs to a mechanism to handle signed 1-byte data, and to
broaden use of NBITS, but I thought this was a good time to iron out a
few other things that have been handled informally, or not at all.

Message-ID: <464D68B8.5090600@daylongraphics.com>

Has anyone been able to write 8-bit grayscale TIFFs using JPEG 
compression? I'm running into an issue where libtiff aborts because the 
photometric interpretation is invalid, even if min_is_black is used. 
Seems the JCS_GRAYSCALE flag never gets set by the driver. Using the 
JPEG driver itself is okay.

The startTransaction()/commitTransaction() methods are only implemented
by the SQLite and PostGis drivers...

Yes, for example: if you do an OGRLayer::CreateFeature() call inside of
an active transaction, and you rollback that transaction, the FID has
still be changed for the given feature given. This may or may not be a
problem (due to the also vague FID semantics in OGR)...

And the implementation complexity is not to neglect, too.

I've done some performance testings, I would like to share. The used
dataset was a 25.000 element polygon shapefile, which should be imported
into a MySQL database.

1. Test:
current OGR-MySQL-Impl: the generated SQL-commands are like this:

INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_1_1>,
<value_1_2>, ...);
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_2_1>,
<value_2_2>, ...);
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_3_1>,
<value_3_2>, ...);
...
=> ~40 features per second

2. Test:
Wrapped current OGR-MySQL-Impl with "START TRANSACTION" and "COMMIT":

START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_1_1>,
<value_1_2>, ...);
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_2_1>,
<value_2_2>, ...);
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_3_1>,
<value_3_2>, ...);
...
COMMIT;
=> ~750 features per second

3. Test:
Optimized CreateFeatures() impl., by using multiple (250) values
definitions inside a single INSERT statement:

INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_1_1>,
<value_1_2>, ...), (<value_2_1>, <value_2_2>, ...), (...);
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_251_1>,
<value_251_2>, ...), (<value_252_1>, <value_252_2>, ...), (...);
...
=> ~850 features per second

4. Test:
Optimized CreateFeatures() impl. (like test #3) with transaction
wrapper:

START TRANSACTION;
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_1_1>,
<value_1_2>, ...), (<value_2_1>, <value_2_2>, ...), (...);
INSERT INTO table (<field_1>, <field_2>, ...) VALUES (<value_251_1>,

I am not familiar with SWIG, but could the following approach by
providing an "extra array object" easier to implement:

struct OGRFeatureArray {
    OGRFeature** papoFeatures;
    int iFeatureCount;
};

OGRErr OGR_L_CreateFeatures( OGRFeatureArray featureArray );

I think the new interface is easy enough, to allow other OGR drivers to

The straight forward C API would look like this:

OGRErr OGR_L_CreateFeatures( OGRFeature** papoFeatures, int
iFeatureCount );

I am not familiar with SWIG-wrapping, but would it be more easy to use
an interface like this:

struct OGRFeatureArray {
    OGRFeature** papoFeatures;
    int iFeatureCount;
};
OGRErr OGR_L_CreateFeatures( OGRFeatureArray features );

Only the SQLite and the PostGIS drivers implement the "transaction"
interface methods of OGRLayer (or is it OGRDataSource?).

Explicitly storing and keeping track of creations, additions, updates,
and deletions and applying these changes later on in time would be
(very) complex and error prone w.r.t. the implementation issues (for
example, to mimic the side effects (e.g. FID updates) of certain
operations ect.)...

I would like to use a simple interface for doing simple operations; the
more complex interfaces (like transactions) should be used for more
complex opertaions, IMHO... :-)

    Kosta

I've no doubts. But this solution is a fairly new and unconventional
approach however this change addresses mainly performance issues of a
particular driver. I consider many of the other drivers wont aware of
setting the features in one single batch if they don't have any
benefits to do so.
Theoretically we are talking about the desired approach for
representing a collection of (cached) features in the OGR API. IMO the
array is not the best data structure to introduce this effort. In the
future we might want to use such data structure in a wider perspective
and possibly adding more properties to this entity. Moreover currently
the Layer is the dedicated entity to represent a collection of the
features (even though the various providers do not actually cache them
in the memory)

This does not help too much, since the OGRFeature** should continue to
be mapped to the target language, and the marshaling logic should be
written by the various SWIG mainainers. It would be much helpful to
introduce a new collection class for this purpose any implement the
Add/Remove/Clear methods on that class.

I'm not aware of which ones are actually implement that. The PostGIS
driver currently supports the submission of the BEGIN/COMMIT commands
but does not retain any data to post it to the database in a single
command. I consider actually not only the performance impact is the
motivation to support this approach but also the ACID properties that
a transaction normally implements.
I've no doubts about the feasibility of the test results you've
provided in your previous post. Actually establishing the transaction
contexts at the database level have some additional cost so submitting
the features in separate transactions is less performant (I consider a
new transaction is implicitly created for every insert/update
operation). But I don't see a great impact in the performance when
providing the data in a single command or multiple command within the
same transaction and the same open connection.
Yes indeed, the transaction is currently supported at the DataSource
object where the connection to the database is normally stored.

The various providers might restrict the conditions of the operations
within the transaction boundaries. For example you might only support
only the additions within a transaction at the povider and later you
might enhance this behaviour.

OGR should reflect a common abstraction level of the various
providers. From the perspecive of the interface it's more complicated
to introduce further elements implemented solely by a limited number
of the providers (actually one) if we may provide this functionality
with the existing interface. If we support further interface elements
than we would make sure that those apply to the other data sources as
well, because the folks would complain about the missing
implementations sooner or later.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Use of gdalwarp/translate utility
Message-ID: <464DCB79.4080804@usgs.gov>

I have a series of images that are 2000x2000 pixels centered on the 
polar regions in a EPSG:3413 projection, though Proj.4/GDAL don't seem 
to know about it yet. I'd like to take the GIFs and embed the 
projection information in the TIFF header so that they may be 
used/interpreted in applications such as transformation to other 
projections.

I've been trying gdal_translate to do this assignment, and gdalinfo 
seems to show some things being set. And yet, I am getting pixels equal 
to units of measure, instead of meters.

The details of this unusual projection:

Based on Polar Stereographic (variant B) method
Base CRS and ellipsoid are WGS84
Latitude of standard parallel: 70N (where the plane intersects)
Longitude of origin: 45W (Greenland is centered)

so I figured I could assign these by hand:

gdal_translate -a_srs "+proj=stere +datum=wgs84 +lat_ts=70.0 +lat_0=90 
+lon_0=-45" -of GTiff input1.gif quickscat1.tif

But my reported coordinates when panning around the image are in pixel 
coordinates, not in meters.

What am I missing in the assignment?

gdalinfo says:

Konstantin,

Just to be clear, the conclusion I got from your statistics is that
nearly all the benefit of doing a bunch of features at once comes from
doing them in a single transaction and therefore that implementing the
transaction semantics for the mysql driver would be sufficient to get
a good data loading performance improvement.

Is that congruent with your reading of the statistics?

I'm left thinking that I would prefer to see transaction semantics in
the mysql driver instead of new bulk interfaces added to OGR as a whole.

Ray,

I just tried it and it seemed to work, though I see the following
debug message, which I find suspicious:

GTiff: Setting JPEGCOLORMODE_RGB

Some of the jpeg stuff is very sensitive to the version of libtiff.  Are you
using the builtin libtiff?  The last public release?  libtiff-3.9 from CVS?

It seems you should add the -a_ullr option (see
http://www.gdal.org/gdal_translate.html) to add coordinates and pixel size
to your raster.
Using -a_srs alone you only add information about coordinate system without
modifying the coordinates themselves (i.e. upper-left coordinates, pixel
size and so on).
So if your GIF doesn't provide these informations to gdal you should add
them by hand.

Good luck,
Guillaume.

This is with the built-in libtiff in 1.3.2. I didn't find any tiff 
driver refs to JCS_GRAYSCALE in 1.4.1 but I should revisit the issue 
when I've had a chance to upgrade.

Another thing I noticed that might be a higher-level problem is that if 
the tiff copycreate() gets a color table from a one-band dataset, it 
assumes rgb. But 8-bit formats w/o an explicit gray mode need color 
tables to emulate it, and there's no way to tell which is which except 
to fabricate a driver properties list ahead of time. A simple fix would 
be to have the driver examine the color table and if it sees that it's 
grayscale, then switch to gray mode.

When I am inside the c:\roger directory everything works as expected. I can
do a gdalinfo on the main dataset and I am also able to do a gdalinfo on the
subdatasets I need.

If I browse to c:\ and I issue the following command:

gdalinfo c:\\roger\\NJ2007136092911.L3_NURC_temp
I get the information for the whole dataset correctly. Here below you have
an excerpt:

I tried the same command with a different dataset and the same problem
arises when I try to access them. I tried to do the same using gdalinfo from
FWTools 1.2.2 experiencing the same problems. However, using OpenEV from the
same FWTools distro I have been able to open up a subdataset and to
visualize it correctly.


I hope that someone can shed some light here. It has been a while since the
last time I played with gdal and HDF hence it might be me doing something
wrong.

Thx a lot,
Simone.

Simone,

I have the same problem with a MODIS file but I found a solution (Skip to
the "***" if you don't want to read it all)

The first exploratory call to gdalinfo works fine:

C:\Data>gdalinfo C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09.004.200526900420
6.hdf
...
SUBDATASET_3_NAME=HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09.0
04.2005269004206.hdf":MOD_Grid_BRDF:Nadir_Reflectance_Quality
...

But if I query for a specific dataset I got the same error as you:

C:\Data>gdalinfo
HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09.004.2005269004206.h
df":MOD_Grid_BRDF:Nadir_Reflectance_Quality
ERROR 4:
`HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09.004.2005269004
206.hdf:MOD_Grid_BRDF:Nadir_Reflectance_Quality' does not exist in the file
system,
and is not recognised as a supported dataset name.

Humm, there is also a typo error in "recognized".

****
The workaround is simple, I just remove the "C:" and it work:

C:\Data>gdalinfo HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09
.004.2005269004206.hdf":MOD_Grid_BRDF:Nadir_Reflectance_Quality

I hope that it works in your case too.
****

It looks like if you are in "programming mode" (FWTools or GDAL API) that
could be a problem with more than one disk driver. Isn't it right?

Anyway, I always thought that this mechanism for selecting dataset in
gdalinfo is IMHO a little user unfriendly. I suggest that the first
exploratory call should issue a numeric index for each datasets so that the
user can refer to that in the second call, e.g.:

C:\Data>gdalinfo C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09.004.200526900420
6.hdf
...
SUBDATASET_3_NAME[4]=HDF4_EOS:EOS_GRID:"C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v0
9.004.2005269004206.hdf":MOD_Grid_BRDF:Nadir_Reflectance_Quality
...
C:\Data>gdalinfo -s 4 C:\Data\Modis\MCD43B4.A2005241.h13v09.004.200526900420
6.hdf

Of course that will require the same change in gdal_translate, gdalwarp and
other utilities. That could also affect the others multi-dataset GDAL
drivers.

Ivan Lucena

Hi list,
I am having some issues working with hdf4 driver on some modis aqua data.

I am working with gdal trunk which I built myself two days ago on my windows
xp box.

Hi,

I'm looking for someone who tries to use GEOS in the C# OGR.

Thanks.

Best Regards

PIERRET Jean michel

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,

I try to use the OGR's library in Csharp and the GEOS support but I have 2
problems. I'm using the "gdal-svn-trunk-2007.05.09".

1) With the objects "OSGEO.OGR.Geometry" when I use the method "Contains" it
turns over me an error "GEOS support not enabled". However I have
uncommented the support GEOS in the file "nmake.opt" and the compilation
return no error.

GEOS_CFLAGS = -IE:\Mapserver\geos-2.2.3\source/capi -DHAVE_GEOS
GEOS_LIB     = E:\Mapserver\geos-2.2.3\source/geos_c_i.lib

When I use on the same object the method "Intersect" it seems work. 

2) Can I use in csharp this method: "Ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt".

Best Regards

PIERRET Jean michel

Thanks for this page, but I think it needs improvements. Its contents are
quite redundant with the official doc of gdal_translate.
I think of two possibilities :
1. Modify official doc of gdal_translate to get this point more clear.
2. Transform this wiki page in a "HOWTO add geographic references
(projection, coordinates) to an image using gdal_translate" with simple
examples and explanations of commands used. This way the page would become a
good add-on to the official doc.
These are suggestions, I hope it will help ...

Regards,
Guillaume.

Hi,

It seems that the GEOS support is not actually enabled in your
project. In this case the Intersect method tests the overlapping of
the envelopes of the 2 geometries.

Are you sure the correct version of the dll-s have been loaded?

In the recent days I've changed the csharp bindings to link against
gdal14.dll instead of the static linking. The previous approach might
lead to various problems. Checkout the latest svn-trunk to rely on
these changes.

Best regards,

Tamas

In trying to use the gdal_translate on a non-standard projection, the 
hardest part I found was to determine what the allowable syntax and 
meaning of the PROJ.4 parameters were (i.e. +lat_0=70, +ellps=WGS84) as 
an argument to a_srs. I figured it out by googling some examples, but 
there is no clean list that I could find. If there is a list of such 
parameters, it should be linked from the gdal_translate page -- and the 
general GDAL page for that matter -- with the appropriate support for 
each projection. The GeoTIFF projections transform list is a great 
start, but still does not include the PROJ.4 syntax for each projection 
parameter. http://www.remotesensing.org/geotiff/proj_list/

Paul,

I know .aux files used to store projection information for MrSID rasters
and PCI's raw .aux format. May be those two are the same formats, I
don't know.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Dealing with RPC offsets and parameters in GDAL
Message-ID: <4651F842.7070900@missouri.edu>

Frank,

my colleagues and I were given a set of NITF images.  We found that the
pan and multispectral image of the same scene do not always
co-registered correctly.  When this happens, we found that some of the
RPC parameters in the two images, such as RPC_LONG_OFF, RPC_LONG_SCALE,
RPC_LAT_OFF, RPC_LAT_SCALE, RPC_HEIGHT_OFF, and RPC_HEIGHT_SCALE, hold
different values. 

We thought that we can correct the co-registration problem by *somehow*
matching the values of these RPC parameters in both pan and MS. 
Changing these parameters would be done by applying some RPC-based
transformation, correct?

Do you have any information or examples on how to deal with RPC-based
transformation in GDAL?

I have found some RPC related functions in GDAL, such as
GDALCreateRPCTransformer().  I am still tracing how to get the
GDALRPCInfo object needed by GDALCreateRPCTransformer().  I have found a
function called GDALExtractRPCInfo() in gdal_misc.cpp that takes a char
** , extracts the RPC parameters from the string array, and saves them
in a GDALRPCInfo object.  But I am still unclear how to obtain the
string array containing the RPC parameters from the image metadata of an
NITF image.

Any info on RPC related functions in GDAL you can share with me will be
very helpful.

Thank you.

Dear gdal-dev list,
 
Does anyone have any experience with data sets in non-projected (geographic) coordinate systems based on a rotated lat/long sphere? Such georeferencing seems to be common in local-area meteorological models. Can they be described by the existing geodetic models in GDAL?

Message-ID: <ED3A48B9840E594890A2BC172D1194650BFABD8A@mailman.san.com>

Hi Frank/All,

 

I am looking at a potential bug in ESRI SRS transform for AAIGrid, and
just want to double check my assumptions.   Currently, for Projection
TRANSVERSE in file ogr_srs_esri.cpp the projection parameter order is
assumed as follows:

PARAM_2 -> Latitude

PARAM_3 -> Longitude

PARAM_1 -> Scale

PARAM_4 -> False Easting

PARAM_5 -> False Northing

 

In the file below, and several others like it, I see that PARAM_2 is
actually Longitude and PARAM_3 is Latitude. 

 

I am having difficulty locating any description for what a prj.adf file
should look like.  If this, indeed, looks like a bug, I will file it in
TRAC and attach a patch file.

 

======================== prj.adf ==========================

Projection    TRANSVERSE

Datum         NAD27

Spheroid      CLARKE1866

Units         METERS

Zunits        NO

Xshift        0.0

Yshift        0.0

Parameters    

1.0 /* scale factor at central meridian

-106 56  5.149215 /* longitude of central meridian

  39 33 45.40326 /* latitude of origin

0.0 /* false easting (meters)

0.0 /* false northing (meters)  

========================= end prj.adf =========================

Thanks,

Mateusz, 
no, it was not quite what I was looking for. It is the Erdas Imagine
auxilary format (Leica) I'm looking for. It could be connected to any
raster file format and it is a binary file.
Leica will not tell me how to read this they, want me to buy their
toolkit. I think it is to much, just to position a raster file. Could I
read it out from the Gdal source code? If so which file?

Kind regards,
Paul

Hi,

It seems that the GEOS support is not actually enabled in your
project. In this case the Intersect method tests the overlapping of
the envelopes of the 2 geometries.

Are you sure the correct version of the dll-s have been loaded?

In the recent days I've changed the csharp bindings to link against
gdal14.dll instead of the static linking. The previous approach might
lead to various problems. Checkout the latest svn-trunk to rely on
these changes.

Best regards,

Tamas

Message-ID: <20070522092316.163380@gmx.net>

Hi!
I have a python program that reprojects a large number of large images. Often, it crashes with an out of memory error (GDAL 1.4.0, HDF driver on Linux/i386). I create many rasters, open them (with gdal.Open()), but assumed that Pythons Garbage Collector was looking after my memory. Before I delve deeper into the code, I'd like to know whether it is good practice to delete gdal handlers in Python. This is for old-gen python, but I wonder whether it has changed/will change for ngpython. The Python bit of the API tutorial does not mention cleaning up for Python...

Cheers!
Jose

Jose,

Generally speaking the old and new python bindings properly clean up datasets
when there are no python references to them anymore.

It is possible you are suffering from bug 1485 which results in internal HDF
resources not being properly released for some datasets:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1485

You could try out the very latest FWTools or build from the latest trunk or
1.4 branch source if you suspect that is the issue.

It is also possible that there are reference counting problems in the bindings
in some complex circumstances that may be impacting you.  If you can provide
a bug report sufficient for us to easily reproduce the problem we might be able
to dig into it.

Paul,

With some custom programming it is possible to produce .aux files with the
HFA code in gdal/frmts/hfa.  It can be fiddly work though.  Contact me off
list if you need to pursue this option.

Jean,

I've tested the trunk with the GEOS option and seems to be working for
me. I've added a new example (OGRGEOS.cs) to the trunk for testing the
geos support.

I continue to think you are using an incorrect version of the
gdal14.dll. Would you mind copying the compiled version of this dll
into you application directory? You might also run the ogrgeos.exe in
the swig/csharp directory (after copying gdal14.dll here).

Best regards,

Tamas

Hi,

It's seems ok now.

My Problem was not in the compil of gdal but in the compil of geos my
geos_c.dll was corrupt.

Apologize for any inconvenience

Jean,

I've tested the trunk with the GEOS option and seems to be working for
me. I've added a new example (OGRGEOS.cs) to the trunk for testing the
geos support.

I continue to think you are using an incorrect version of the
gdal14.dll. Would you mind copying the compiled version of this dll
into you application directory? You might also run the ogrgeos.exe in
the swig/csharp directory (after copying gdal14.dll here).

Best regards,

Tamas

Rostic,

Your analysis is dead on.  I have filed this as a bug, and corrected it
in trunk and 1.4 branch as well as adding a test for this format.

Ozy,

I imagine you are on the right track, but I don't know how practical it
will be to establish correspondance.

The char ** argument to GDALExtractRPCInfo() is the metadata list containing
the parameters.  That is, the list you would get back from a call to
GDALGetMetadata() on the dataset.

Note that the GDAL RPC Transformer does *not* use a variable elevation
model, and should be considered suitable only for gross geolocation, not
the precision geolocation for which RPCs were intended.

Loosely speaking, GDAL does a good job of reading RPC parameters, but
it does not offer good tools to exploit them.  They were really implemented
for applications that had their own higher level RPC algorithms.

Doug,

Unfortunately, there is no concise PROJ.4 reference listing parameters
for all projections.  This is a task beyond my endurance to take on...

Yes it would be cleaner to add that to the official docs, however I 
don't have the ability to do that.  Now that it is written in the wiki 
though perhaps someone with write access to the official docs will 
insert it. :)

I enthusiasticly encourage anyone/everyone to do exactly that! It is a 
wiki after all (free osgeo login's at 
http://www.osgeo.org/osgeo_userid/) . I certainly plan to do so myself 
as those occasions arise in my work. :)

Thanks for the info, Frank.

I was hoping we can solve this using GDAL.  We are given a bunch of 1B
level images .... they are ortho-ready, but some rectification need to
be done to correctly co-register the Pan and MS before we can create the
pansharpened MS.

Subject: [Gdal-dev] OGR2OGR GML coordinate reversal
Message-ID: <46535198.8080007@email.unc.edu>

Hi folks

I'm trying to convert a GML file (3.1 I think) to a shapefile using 
ogr2ogr (GDAL 1.3.2.0).  The conversion works and the attributes 
translate nicely, but the destination file's point coordinates are 
reversed from the source file.  The source GML file uses the following 
nomenclature:

                <gml:Point>
                    <gml:pos>lat lon</gml:pos>
                </gml:Point>

OGR seems to expect the order to be lon then lat.  Is there any way to 
tell ogr2ogr how to reverse the expected order of coordinates inside 
these tags?  Or maybe my source file doesn't meet the GML spec and 
should be changed to lon then lat?  Thanks...

Jesse,

Unfortunately, there is no easy way to fix this problem.  There are
legitimate ways of declaring coordinate order in GML but OGR ignores them.

OGR GML is mostly compatible with GML 2, but there are some of GML 3
features supported.

Yes, OGR maps lat/lon to X/Y, what results in reversed order
becasue X is usually lon and Y is lat.

In GML, standard cartographic order is used, latitude/longitude.
If dealing projected coordinates system, the easting-northing order is
used. So, there are many possible standards, and OGR ignores them in
some way, reading first coordiante as X and second as Y,
as in cartesian coordinate system.

Frank,

May be GML driver should be more specific and less ignorant here,
and parse coordiantes in  lat-lon order ?

No, there isn't.

I believe your GML file is correct according GML.

Yes, OGR maps lat/lon to X/Y, what results in reversed order
becasue X is usually lon and Y is lat.

In GML, standard cartographic order is used, latitude/longitude.
If dealing projected coordinates system, the easting-northing order is
used. So, there are many possible standards, and OGR ignores them in
some way, reading first coordiante as X and second as Y,
as in cartesian coordinate system.

Frank,

May be GML driver should be more specific and less ignorant here,
and parse coordiantes in  lat-lon order ?

No, there isn't.

I believe your GML file is correct according GML.

Thanks Frank.  One of the images that I tried was a tiff but I think  
it must have been the PNGs that were poor.  When Assefa tried it by  
converting to a tiled tiff first, performance was substantially better.

Message-ID: <6fb81fc70705230146r63124d35m9705678de9e1c27a@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I guess I'm missing something but I haven't been able to successfully
parse OGR's GML with XSLT.

Sample OGR/GML file:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<ogr:FeatureCollection
     xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
     xsi:schemaLocation="http://ogr.maptools.org/lightnings.xsd"
     xmlns:ogr="http://ogr.maptools.org/"
     xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml">
  <gml:boundedBy>
    <gml:Box>
      <gml:coord><gml:X>366874</gml:X><gml:Y>2130603</gml:Y></gml:coord>
      <gml:coord><gml:X>387709</gml:X><gml:Y>2166975</gml:Y></gml:coord>
    </gml:Box>
  </gml:boundedBy>
  <gml:featureMember>
    <ogr:lightning fid="F0">
      <ogr:geometryProperty><gml:Point><gml:coordinates>371000,2

      <ogr:rowid>42</ogr:rowid>
      <ogr:date>2007/01/21 01:16:45</ogr:date>
      <ogr:nbstrokes>16</ogr:nbstrokes>
      <ogr:amplitude>-1337</ogr:amplitude>
    </ogr:lightning>

Sample XSL file:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<xsl:stylesheet version="1.0"
        xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"
        xmlns:gml="http://www.opengis.net/gml"
        xmlns:ogr="http://gdal.velocet.ca/ogr"
        xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

<xsl:output method="text" />

<xsl:template match="ogr:lightning">
  <xsl:value-of select="@fid" />
</xsl:template>

</xsl:stylesheet>

It seems to be related with the ogr namespace since the gml namespace
doesn't cause any problem. Any hints ?

Thanks.

The XML document above is not well formed.  You need to close the
gml:featureMember and ogr:FeatureCollection tags.  Furthermore, the root
xsi:schemaLocation should be an attribute with two (space separated)
values: the namespace, and the location (relative of URL) of the XML
Schema document.

The second issue won't prevent you from applying an XSLT transformation,
though.

The ogr namespace defined in the GML document and the XML Schema differ;
they must be identical.

If I apply these changes to the above documents and test with something
like xsltproc, things work as expected.

Hope this helps.

Message-ID: <C2AEB54F26AA034888B9F3BF7A8B1594046540E2@vnu001schmsx01.enterprisenet.org>

I'm trying to convert an ESRI shape file of Canada provinces to MapInfo
tab format using ogr2ogr from the FWTools shell.  The shape file is
unprojected Long/Lat format.
 
When I try this comand line...
 
ogr2ogr -f "MapInfo File" -nlt GEOMETRY province.tab province.shp
 
...  the resulting tab file is one forth the shape file size and very
low precision.  When zooming in other than full extent, the edges are
very blocking and some not conected.
 
I also tried...
 
ogr2ogr -f "MapInfo File" -a_srs "WGS84" province.tab province.shp
 
... with the same results.
 
Any help would be greatly appreciated!
 
Thank you,

Hi list,

gdal_translate can convert NITF images to GTiff format.
But the built-in RPC coefficients are lost.

Is there a utility or gdal python code that extracts the RPC
coefficients and saves as a file?

Thanks,
Shawn

Shawn,

gdalinfo should report them as metadata that can be cut and paste.
A translation to GeoTIFF *should* also preserve them in the metadata
of the GeoTIFF.  So I'm surprised to hear they are lost.

Frank,

I suppose that the silence on this thread denotes the implicit agreement  :-)

I also support this RFC, changing the layout of the metadata structure
not always require an RFC to have, since it might be internal to a
particular dataset type. In this particular case, however, a fair
amount of the drivers are affected for the convergence of the
interpretation. Shouldn't we pull any of the values as a separate
property of the dataset and the band if it is widely used?


Best regards,

Tamas

Hi List,

Questions for gdal 1.4.0 on Linux

openev.sourceforge.net's Building gdal for Linux/Unix suggests that:
configure --with-libz=internal --with-png=internal
--with-libtiff=internal --with-geotiff=internal

The gdal/frmts/ contents include png/gtiff/libtiff
1) There is no libz under gdal/frmts/, but zlib instead.  Is zlib=libz?

2) Since I have installed zlib/jpeg, I should set them as external,
right?

3) The gdal/frmts/ contents also include hdf4/hdf5/jpeg2000
Doest it mean that I can use these internal libraries? I thought that
HDF4/5 needs to be downloaded from HDF group.

4) Assume that internal hdf4/hdf5 support are ok, the followings lines
in GDALmake.opt need to be changed to:
	# HDF4 Support.
	HAVE_HDF5     = yes
	HDF4_INCLUDE  =  -I$(frmts/hdf4)

	# HDF5 Support.
	HAVE_HDF5     = yes
	HDF5_INCLUDE  =  -I$(frmts/hdf5)
Is this right?  Do I need to add -L flags?

5) what about jpeg2000, do I need to download JasPer?  Or 
	# JPEG-2000 Support via JasPer library.
	HAVE_JASPER     = yes
	JASPER_INCLUDE  = -I$(frmts/jpeg2000)

Do I need to change proj4 setting?
	PROJ_STATIC	=	no


Thanks,
Shawn

Yes, zlib == libz.

You can, and there is likely no harm in doing so.

hdf4, hdf5 and jpeg2000 all require external support libraries.

No.  I'd suggest you configure to use the external libraries.  If
that doesn't work you can fiddle with the GDALmake.opt manually.

Yes

This can normally be left as "no".  GDAL will load libproj.so at
runtime if it finds it.  While arguably this was a bizarre approach,
it was done to reduce the number of GDAL build time dependencies.

Obviously.This was only an excerpt of the actual XML file. I should
have properly closed the tags so that it could make it through a
parser. My bad.

Ooooh, yes. I needed to refresh my XML knowledge anyway :). Thanks for that!

There's probably something wrong in OGR then, because the document was
generated by ogr2ogr.

Looks like I should refresh my XSL knowledge as well !

It did! Thanks a lot.

Message-ID: <21112210.1180010467461.JavaMail.adm-moff@moffice3.nsc.no>

Hi!!

Have some simple linestringdata (WKT) saved in an MS SQL table. I use these in an Mapserver application (reading via OGR).

But i noticed that some of my records just wont show in my map, so i used OGR2OGR to export data from the MS SQL table to a ESRI SHapefile.

What happens is that most of my records are OK in the OGR2OGR dump...but some records are just displayed as "NullShapes" (using the shpdump tool) e.g:

Shape:389 (NullShape)  nVertices=0, nParts=0
  Bounds:(       0.000,       0.000, 0, 0)

The "problem" records are not any more "complicated" than any of the other records in my dataset. Here is an example:

Any idea why some (very few) records in my MS SQL table is not possible to dump to shapefile via OGR2OGR?

All help appriciated :-)

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Problem building gdal .deb packages
Message-ID: <4655B69B.4040807@jemila.jazztel.es>

Hello
I'm trying to build gdal .deb packages from source with ecw support. I 
have modified /debian/rules file as follows:
...
configure: configure-stamp
--with-ecw=ARG Include ECW support (ARG=ECW SDK Path, yes or no)
configure-stamp: patch-stamp
...

I get next error:
dh_installdeb
dh_shlibdeps -L libgdal1-1.3.2 -l debian/libgdal1-1.3.2/usr/lib
dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: could not find any packages for libNCSEcw.so.0

make[1]: *** [binary-common] Error 1
make[1]: se sale del directorio `/home/carlos/Temp/gdal-1.3.2'
make: *** [binary-arch] Error 2

libNCSEcw, libNCSCnet and libNCSUtil are installed under /usr/local/lib 
and this path is in ld.so.conf, so they should be found.
/lib64/libpthread.so.0 points to /lib64/libpthread-2.5.so
Can anyone help?
Thanks in advance

Scott,

Here are my suggestions to follow:

1. Since there were a high number of changes in the recent days I
would suggest to use the current svn-trunk. Many of the changes were
described at:
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/GdalOgrCsharpVersions
checkout the SVN trunk.

2. Download and extract the swigwin1.3.31 package

3. The following values should be set in nmake.opt (for the VC2005 builds)
SWIG = [path to swig]\swig.exe
MSVC_VER=1400

4 .You should compile the gdal core before compiling the csharp interface
C:\GDAL> nmake /f makefile.vc

5. C#
C:\GDAL\swig\csharp> nmake /f makefile.vc interface
C:\GDAL\swig\csharp> nmake /f makefile.vc

6. Add the gdal root directory in the the PATH (alternatively you can
copy gdal14.dll and proj.dll to the swig\csharp directory)
set PATH=C:\GDAL;%PATH%

7.
C:\GDAL\swig\csharp> nmake /f makefile.vc test

If you don't have any of the required dll-s (like proj) download the
recent FWTools package
http://test.gdal.org/fwtools/FWTools130.exe

Best regards,

Tamas

Hi Mateusz and Frank,

Thanks for the help with the following 2 issues.

Max open files:

OSX does indeed have a default limit of 256 open files per process  
although ulimit reports "unlimited" which is of course the hard  
(upper) limit.  I'm now using setrlimit() to allow 2048 and all is well.


PostGIS driver vs shapefile driver:


I made some measurements and would be interested to hear your thoughts.
The code reads a data via OGR and renders this to screen.

Typical time to read and render PostGIS: 1,209,100,332 nanoseconds
Typical time to read and render shapefiles:  225,924,592 nanoseconds

These timings are rendering exactly the same data at the same  
resolution using the same code. I am using SetSpatialFilterRect in  
both cases. PostGIS is running on the same machine, is GiST indexed,  
and is using its default driver options.

PG appears to me to be 6 times slower than shapefiles: is this what  
you'd expect,  or should I be able to tune the PG query in some way  
(perhaps using binary cursors?)

Regards,
Dave Robertson

Dave,

The OGR PostGIS read support is not well optimized, so I'm not surprised
at a difference, though this is more dramatic than I would have
expected.  It makes me wonder if perhaps spatial querying is not being
used for something.

You might try replacing PG: with PGB: in your datasource name for postgis
access.  This uses alternate postgis driver code in OGR with binary
fetching for geometries.  This code path is not very well maintained, but
is reportedly significantly faster than fetching geometries in text format.

Best regards,

Maciej,

I think it's hard to find where is the problem from your report.
Could you provide me with your shapefile?

Then I will be able to write simple test reproducing your steps
and then we can observe if OGR behaves correctly or not.

Hello All,

I have the same data in three different formats: 16-bit signed integer 
(*.bin), 32-bit signed integer (*.bin), and 32-bit float (*.flt).  I'm 
not getting the correct answers when I run "gdalinfo -stats", the min 
and max should be -6488 and 1320 respectively.

The (seemingly incorrect) response I get is the same for each file:

Should I be forcing these to a different driver or modifying the

Folks,

I neglected to follow up on this motion.  I now declare it passed with
+1 support from Howard, Tamas, Daniel and myself.

I believe Konstantin will be doing some immediate work on the MySQL and
SQLite drivers.

Welcome aboard!

Message-ID: <3f7a6e1c0705280345u35c62a73j66d1d3f16d928405@mail.gmail.com>

I need to create paletted PNG files with transparency.

I understand that I need to pass in a colour table with the alpha channel
set to 0.

As I cannot create PNGs directly, I first create a Tiff with the colourtable
and then do a CreateCopy.

But when I then look at the PNG colour table, the transparency values are
gone (all set to 255). This is also true for the intermediate Tiff file --
which is understandable as single band tiffs don't do transparency. I think
when creating the tiff the colourtable is adjusted so that it works for the
Tiff, but then my transparencies are lost. (If someone thinks this is a bug,
I will turn my code into a short example).

I tried to alter the colour table after creating the tiff (or the createCopy
of the PNG), but this is not supported.

What's the best way to do this -- maybe I just need a better intermediate
format that does transparencies and can be created (which one?)

Any hints?

Regards

Ludwig

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Supported projections/transformation in a GUI
Message-ID: <f3eenm$qaj$1@sea.gmane.org>

Ok folks, here is question to crack.

Simple idea:
User can pick either a file with geo-data in it or an image without.
If it is a file without geo-data the user is to be able to select which 
projection/coordinate system the image is saved in and also set up the 
coordinates of the edges of the map.  A transformation of coordinates 
between map local projection and WGS84 will the be set up.

My big problem is the case with no geo-data. I need to set up an 
interface which an ordinary user can use, a user with not to much 
experience of projections and such stuff.

Firstly I need to sort out which, in GDAL, available projections that 
are common. Just to reduce the list.
Next I need to find a friendly name to present them with.
If possible - sort them corresponding to where they are used, for 
example  the user can select USA and get all the UTM-zones (and by 
knowing the coordinates of the map select the right zone). Or replace 
USA with a European country and their specific common projections.

I'm a bit lost, don't know where to start. The ideas above is just loose 
ideas.

Suggestions? Any tools in GDAL that can help me? Anyway to look up the 
available projections in GDAL? Anyway to sort out the "valid" projections?

Working with GDAL from C#.

Pls
/tomas

Ludwig,

If you image isn't too large, and you are doing programatically (or
via scripts) you might want to use MEM format as your intermediate format.
I believe it supports fully featured color tables, and no mess and fuss
with intermediate file cleanup.

   http://www.gdal.org/frmt_mem.html

Note, when creating MEM datasets and not needing to attach to an existing
array in memory, just use any name for the dataset, such as "tempimage".

Many thanks,

that seems to work beautifully.

So far I had been using tiff images as an intermediate container when
creating files for which no Create() method is available, but the in memory
MEM format  of course is much superior, no fuss with temp files and no need
to write to disk.

Regards

Ludwig

Maybe this was a bit premature.

Unfortunately, the MEM dataset does not support the SetGCPs method, even
though the documentation says it 'should' .
(" Memory datasets should support for most kinds of auxilary information
including metadata, coordinate systems, georeferencing, GCPs, color
interpretation, nodata, color tables and all pixel data types.")

This works with the GTiff driver, but not with MEM:

import gdal
import gdal_array
import gdalconst
import numpy

rows = 10
cols = 10

data = numpy.ones((rows,cols), numpy.int16)

driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('MEM')
image = driver.Create('dummy', rows, cols, 1, gdalconst.GDT_Int16)
gcps = []
gcps.append(gdal.GCP(1,2,3,4))
image.SetGCPs(gcps, '')

Ludwig,

I see your analysis is correct - the MEM driver actually lacked GCP support
despite the docs.  I have added this in trunk, if that is convenient for you.

I'm thinking about whether to travel to Victoria and if yes, what to do 
there except wander around aimlessly.

On the website I came across the CodeSprint. Perhaps the bindings are 
such a difficult topic that maybe it would deserve a CodeSprint? Maybe 
we could talk around the issue also a bit more widely (as GEOS also has 
SWIG bindings and other libraries perhaps have / could have). I'm not 
sure if Aaron is on this list, but he mentions Python bindings in the 
goals of QGIS CodeSprint in the wiki.

Would we have enough / key people (Tamas? Hobu? Charlie?)? This is just 
a wild idea but I think it surely would be useful to discuss the 
bindings and do some grand or not so grand scheme design.

Cheers,

Ari

That now works, thanks.

For the benefit of others this poorly coded Python example shows the way to
use the MEM dataset with GCPs and ColorTable with transparencies to then
create both a paletted GTiff (no transparencies supported, so the
transparent green appear in the tiff, but the GCPs are there), and a PNG
(with transparencies, but without GCPs):

import gdal
import gdal_array
import gdalconst
import numpy

rows = 10
cols = 10

data = numpy.ones((rows,cols), numpy.uint8)
data[4:7,...] = 0


driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('MEM')
image = driver.Create('dummy', rows, cols, 1, gdalconst.GDT_Byte)
gcps = []
gcps.append (gdal.GCP(1,2,3,4))
image.SetGCPs(gcps, '')

colorTable = gdal.ColorTable()
greentransparent = (0, 255, 0, 0)
blue = (0,0, 255,255)
colorTable.SetColorEntry(0, greentransparent)
colorTable.SetColorEntry(1, blue)
b = image.GetRasterBand(1)
b.SetRasterColorTable(colorTable)
b.WriteArray(data)

tiffdriver = gdal.GetDriverByName('GTiff')
tiffdriver.CreateCopy('dummy.tif', image)

pngdriver = gdal.GetDriverByName('PNG')
pngdriver.CreateCopy('dummy.png', image)


Frank, while I was building from svn trunk, I stumbled over a number of C++
comments in C files/ headers

Ari,

Although I haven't managed to collect enough sponsorship to get to the
conference so far, I consider this as a fairly compelling idea.

We might want to cover at least the following areas:

- harmonize the typemap usage between the various bindings (and update
the README.typemaps accordingly)
- determine which of the gdal/ogr features should be added to (or
perhaps removed from) the SWIG interface.
- look over the possibilities to automate the creation of the
code-comment-documentation for the various languages .
- construct the expected object model diagram to follow by the various
languages (and publish the model itself)
- discuss the language specific issues and the expected treatments.
- etc.

Regardless of the fact whether I can eventually be there or not, I'm
happy to participate in such efforts remotely as well.

Best regards,

Tamas

Dear List,

i am having some problems with reprojecting shapefiles from NZMG to NZTM. 
I have copied the nzgd2kgrid0005.1gsb into the projlib directory (on my 
Suse 10.2 installation it is in the

ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" north_island_nztm.shp 'FRWP/Active/38A08772

i get the following output. Where the datum is "Mean_Sea_Level" - which i 
suspect is incorrect. I thought the datum should have been NZGD2000. Any 
help would be greatly appreciated.

Hi Andrew,
 
Looks like ogr2ogr and ogrinfo is building the wrong datum WKT string.
I've even tried transforming a test shape file and the .prj file
produced had an incorrect WKT projection definition:

i.e
ogr2ogr -f "ESRI Shapefile" crs_node_nztm.shp crs_node.shp -a_srs
"+proj=nzmg +lat_0=-41 +lon_0=173 +x_0=2510000 +y_0=6023150 +ellps=intl
+datum=nzgd49 +units=m +no_defs <> +nadgrids=nzgd2kgrid0005.gsb +wktext"
-t_srs EPSG:2193

crs_node_nztm.prj =

PROJCS["NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator",
   GEOGCS["NZGD2000",
        DATUM["D_",
           SPHEROID["GRS_1980",6378137,298.257222101]],
           PRIMEM["Greenwich",0],UNIT["Degree",0.017453292519943295]],
    PROJECTION["Transverse_Mercator"],
    PARAMETER["latitude_of_origin",0],
    PARAMETER["central_meridian",173],
    PARAMETER["scale_factor",0.9996],
    PARAMETER["false_easting",1600000],
    PARAMETER["false_northing",10000000],
    UNIT["Meter",1]]

This is the WKT information from postgis which looks like it has the
correct definition (don't worry about the AUTHORITY references).

"PROJCS["NZGD2000 / New Zealand Transverse Mercator",
   GEOGCS["NZGD2000",
       DATUM["New_Zealand_Geodetic_Datum_2000",
          SPHEROID["GRS
1980",6378137,298.257222101,AUTHORITY["EPSG","7019"]],
      TOWGS84[0,0,0,0,0,0,0],AUTHORITY["EPSG","6167"]],
      PRIMEM["Greenwich",0,AUTHORITY["EPSG","8901"]],
      UNIT["degree",0.01745329251994328, AUTHORITY["EPSG","9122"]],

   PARAMETER["false_northing",10000000],
   UNIT["metre",1,AUTHORITY["EPSG","9001"]],AUTHORITY["EPSG","2193"]]"

The actual transformation of the shapefiles seems good, as I've
compared some test against a couple of datasets which were transformed
using our own tools.

Cheers

Message-ID: <27e900d30705290007x279086case32726f53eef3275@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I've seen this error mentioned before on the list, and
I've been digging in the gdal_translate source for a while now,
but can't yet figure out what is going wrong.

This is the output I'm getting:
Input file size is 51215, 33632
0...10...20...ERROR 1: Illegal block requested.
ERROR 1: IReadBlock failed at X offset 0, Y offset 2520
ERROR 1: GetBlockRef failed at X block offset 0, Y block offset 2520

I'm finding that "psInfo" holds a variable "nBlocksPerColumn",
which is set to 2520.
As soon as I request a row beyond 4 times that value
(i.e. I do gdal_translate -srcwin 0 10800 1 1, for example)
(which should be possible because the input data has 33632 rows)
it gives me the above error.

Any ideas?

thanks,

Patrick

Patrick,

I can't see what would be going on here.  If the input file is AAGRID
format, and the file has 33632 rows, I don't know why nBlocksPerColumn
would be 2520.   I think you would need to make the file available for
this to be pursued - though it sounds painfully large.

hi Frank,

Thanks for the reply. I wrote a Perl script to get some data
out of hdr.adf, etc., maybe this helps (see below). It seems there are
(475000 - 306840) / 5 = 33632 rows (as expected), but hdr.adf
says a tile is 4 pixels high, and HTilesPerColumn is 2520 (?!), which
should be 33632 / 4 = 8408, right?

Alright, I feel silly now for not mentioning that
there are other raster files in the directory.

I'm using gdal 1.4.1 here.

I suppose I could hack something that merges the index files and raster
files into a single large index&raster file..

Tomas,

Currently the interface has only a limited support to this effort.
Some time ago the only option I've found have been described at this
ticket:

http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1469

However I had to apply a patch to make this feature work and I don't
know exactly whether it have eventually been fixed or not. I'd
appreciate you to make a test, and provide the comment about the
results to this ticket.


Best regards,

Tamas

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Connecting to PostGIS using rgdal
Message-ID: <BAY102-DAV18A5C95661E36D89E33FDBC2F0@phx.gbl>

Hello,

I am trying to see if I can access a table from PostGIS using rgdal in
the R statistics program.  I've been able to read information from
shapefiles, as the example below demonstrates.  However, whenever I try
to read from a PG connection, I get a message saying it cannot open the
file (also in my output below).  I'm on WinXP, running R-2.5.0, rgdal
0.5-9 installed from CRAN, and I have FWTools 1.3.1 installed.  Output
from ogrinfo (from FWTools) reports information from the same PG
connection/dataset I'm trying to access using rgdal without any trouble.

I'm wondering what step I've missed in the setup of R, rgdal, or
FWTools/GDAL.  I have added the FWTools bin folder to my Path
environment variable, as well as added GDAL_DATA, but that doesn't seem
to help.  Is there anything I'm likely to have missed?  I checked the
output from ogrDrivers(), and it looks like PostgreSQL isn't included -
so would this mean that I have to compile rgdal myself?  If so, are
there instructions for this?

Thanks in advance for any help,
Mike

Message-ID: <cca1454a0705300145v63c5b37ax7d7827f08dd47b56@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've found that gdal-1.4.1/frmts/aaigrid/aaigriddataset.cpp reads data
with integer >= 32768 as negative value (see
http://grass.itc.it/pipermail/grassuser/2007-May/039832.html).  To
import the data into grass, I need to modify aaigriddataset.cpp to use
Int32 instead of Int16 as in the attached file.

Is there any reason using Int16 for aaigrid format?  I hope this will
be fixed in the next version of gdal.

Cheers,

Hello,

I've come up with a hacky solution to be able to
access all the data when the dataset is multitiled.

In my case, the data files are:
w001001.adf
w001000.adf
z001001.adf
z001002.adf

Below this e-mail I've included a Perl script that reads hdr.adf,
dblbnd.adf, sta.adf, and w001001x.adf, and produces some more
info than gdalinfo. Especially useful, it gives the number of tiles
in the index file, which you can use to compute where the next file
starts.

In my case w001001x.adf has info for 506520 tiles. Divide this by
HTilesPerRow (201) to get 2520, multiply by HTileYSize (4) to get
10800 rows. My HPixelSizeY is 5, so now I know the w001001.adf
has data for 10800 x 5 = 50400 pixel rows.

>From the boundary file I know that the upper left Y is at 475000,
so now I know the next file (apparently w001000.adf, strange ordering)
starts at 475000 - 50400 = 424600.

The 2nd and 3rd file have the same number of tiles as the 1st, so this
means the 3rd file starts at Y = 424600 - 50400 = 374200, and the 4th
at 374200 - 50400 = 323800. The 4th file has 170448 tiles (number
obtained by running the Perl script below as:
read_adf_info.pl z001002x.adf). All the math checks out with the
boundaries of the dataset.

To get data out of the 4th file, for example, I did the following:
- create a subdirectory "data" in the dataset directory
- move the w001* files in there
- create symbolic links:
  ln -s ./data/z001002.adf w001001.adf
  ln -s ./data/z001002x.adf w001001x.adf
  (this to make sure gdal_translate uses the 4th file)
- compute the -srcwin coordinates, taking into account the origin of
  the 4th file, which is down 3 x 50400 = 151200 from the dataset origin
- run gdal_translate

This example, more specifically: my dataset upper left is at
(13565, 475000). I wanted to extract a grid at upper left
(194990, 317925). The upper left of the 4th file is at
(13565, 323800), which, as far as gdal_translate is now concerned,
is the upper left of the whole dataset.

So the delta Y  = 323800 - 317925 = 5875, divide by cell size 5 =
5875 / 5 = row 1175.
The delta X = 194990 - 13565 = 180925 / 5 = column 36285.

The grid to extract is 600 by 600 cells, so the command becomes:

gdal_translate -oi AAIGrid -srcwin 36285 1175 600 600 hdr.adf mygrid.agr

This is a grid cell for which I had a known other height field, and
they corresponded :-)

I hope this helps people with larger datasets,
let me know if anything is not clear,

Patrick

I ran the code together with the image in the ticket and nothing 
happened to the picture.

But I'm not sure if I am on the right track.

What I would like to do is not reproject the map in anyway. What I am 
after is a possibility to down sample an image/a map using some good 
interpolations technique. My guess is that all I need is the last line 
in the code in the example in the ticket:
> Dataset dsw = drv_out.CreateCopy("CTest.tif", ds, 0, new string[] { 
> "INTERLEAVE=PIXEL",   null });
where I in the string is to provide the interpolation method and the 
size of the copy to save. How to format this string - I haven't got  
clue! Or actually, not even how to format the command line call to 
GDalwarp to use, for example, cubic splines. The correct documentation 
is not easy to find. The doc about gdalwarp options found here:
http://www.gdal.org/gdalwarp.html
doesn't seem to up to date.
Or am I totally of track?

Why use GDAL? Well I have a method using what is available in C# but it 
requires a an image in a format C# can read and it also requires me to 
load whole image to memory. Gdal seems to be able to parse the file and 
why not make use of Gdal when possible?

Markus,

It would be helpful to see the .HDR file.  It seems likely that the
data is actually signed 16bit integer, but being interpreted as
unsigned 16bit integer.  EHDR .HDR files are notoriously underspecified.
I think when used with Arc/Info there was some information (like pixel
type) that was passed on the commandline or something.

Tomas,

The CreateCopy() method does not provide options to control the resampling
mechanism.  In fact, it copies it's source dataset at 1:1 so there is
no resampling.  If the source is a virtual dataset that downsamples some
other file, you would in theory need to pass the resampling type to the
VRT file.  *But* VRT files do not support any resampling type other than
that provided by GDALRasterIO() which is nearest neighbour.

Currently, in GDAL, only the specialized WarpAPI provides resampling
other than nearest neighbour.

Etsushi,

There is no compelling reason to use Int16 for the AAIGRID driver.  If
you want something done about this though, I'd urge you to file a bug
report properly against GDAL.

The downside of defaulting to Int32 for the driver is that it will really
bulk up output files and the Int32 data type is less widely support than
Int16.  And changing this behavior will no doubt cause some people some
pain.

But I think it may be necessary.

Mike,

Based on the ogrDrivers() output, it would appear that the rgdal
package you installed came with it's own copy of GDAL/OGR and that
does not include Postgis support.  Note that FWTools purposefully
uses it's own name for the GDAL DLL (gdal_fw.dll) to avoid conflicts
with other packages.  But this makes it hard to use FWTools DLLs
as replacements for other shipped DLLs.

Sounds like you simply need ReadRaster (in original size) and 
WriteRaster (in a new size) and do the interpolation in between and 
create/open/flush/close around.

At least that's the simple man's approach...

For what it's worth, there is about a 50% chance that I'll be there, and

I thought so at first, but according to the docs, GRIDS are always 
stored as 32bit, and the reported pixel depth is based on what the 
actual cell values are. This was a surprise to me. I guess I never 
noticed since grids are always compressed so the rasters were always in 
the size range expected for their bit depth.

"A grid dataset is always 32 bit (either signed, unsigned, or floating 
point), but ArcGIS shows it as being the most appropriate bit depth 
above (with regard to the cell values it contains); ArcInfo Workstation 
will always tell you the bit depth of the grid."


For the problem Etsushi encountered might it be sufficient to read the 
./info/[gridname].sta file and set the default output type from there? 
(e.g. use the same approach esri does)

Matt,

The question is with regard to the ASCII Arc/Info Image Grid (AAIGRID)
format, not the AIGRID (ie. the binary format).  With the ascii grid
format it seems the only way I can find stuff out is to scan the whole
image which I am loath to do at open time.

Best regards,

Markus,

I found one situation where the AUX file was inconsistent with the AIG
dataset. Gdalinfo was reporting correctly 'unsigned 8 bit', while ArcMap was
reporting 'unsigned 16'. I just remove the .AUX file and the problem was
gone. Is it possible that you are facing the same problem?

Best regards,

Ivan Lucena

Well, since there seems to be nothing else in gdal to use... I hoped 
that I could call on some code that would to that for me..That is the 
simple man's approach :)

I guess it is not that hard to do it with my own code...not a big hard 
algorithm...the biggest problem is probably to decide how big piece of 
the map I am to resample at each step.

Totally OT -
Trying, command line, to translate a part of a  RIK-map to GeoTIFF. 
During the translation a lot of the geo-information is lost. For example 
what datum and what sphere the map projection use. ESPG data also is 
lost. No good, no good.
Should I create a ticket for this somewhere?
(the command I use is:
gdal_translate.exe -of gtiff  -projwin 1612005 6602275 1645680 6570945 
-CO COMPRESS=LZW ab.rik terr Stor_test.TIFF
)
Or to I have to set the projection by hand in the command line?

Yours
Tomas

Markus,

You can add the "PIXELTYPE SIGNEDINT" line in the .hdr to force
interpretation of the file as signed rather than unsigned integers.

Ivan,

I have no idea...:

Not sure what could be taken as AUX file by GDAL.

I can see that you don't have one of those files, but since you mentioned:

That is where they are created.

Hello List!

I am a participant in the OpenStreetMap project, working on a global,
free dataset for all to use! OpenStreetMap currently has approx. 6000
participants world wide building mapdata.

OSM has it's own XML file format. For this file format, no converters to
GIS are available yet.

I was wondering if this would be an opportunity for the GDAL group?

Within our local (Dutch) section of OpenStreetMap there are a couple of
C++ developers. I allready asked them if they would be willing to
contribute to GDAL/OGR.

Kind regards,

Subject: [Gdal-dev] Error opening HDF file
Message-ID: <465EDCD6.9020505@iver.es>

Hello,

I have a gdal compilation (release 1.4.0) with HDF4, HDF5 and Grass 
support. I have a test program that opens and closes some HDF4 image 
many times. The problem is when I have an HDF image wich has many 
subdatasets, Gdal crashes when is trying to open the image for the 31st 
time. That's the source code of my test program:

#include <stdio.h>
#include "gdal.h"

int main()
{
   GDALDatasetH  hDataset;
   int i = 0;
   char* file1 = 
"/home/miguel/cd_datos/Modis/MOD11A1.A2006365.h21v07.004.2007002014854.hdf"; 

   char* file2 = 
"/home/miguel/cd_datos/Modis/MYD09Q1.A2006361.h01v08.004.2007009060450.hdf"; 

   char* file3 = 
"/home/miguel/cd_datos/Modis/MOD09Q1.A2006361.h00v08.004.2007006103307.hdf"; 

   int j = 1;

   GDALAllRegister();

     for (i = 0 ; i < 15 ; i++){
       hDataset = GDALOpen( file1 , GA_ReadOnly );
       if( hDataset != NULL ){
           printf("Open image for %d time\n", j);
       j++;
       }
   GDALClose(hDataset);
   }
   for (i = 0 ; i < 15 ; i++){
       hDataset = GDALOpen( file2 , GA_ReadOnly );
       if( hDataset != NULL ){
           printf("Open image for %d time\n", j);
           j++;
       }
       GDALClose(hDataset);
   }
   for (i = 0 ; i < 15 ; i++){
       hDataset = GDALOpen( file3 , GA_ReadOnly );
       if( hDataset != NULL ){
           printf("Open image for %d time\n", j);
           j++;
       }
       GDALClose(hDataset);
   }
}

And that's the error:

...
Open image for 27 time
Open image for 28 time
Open image for 29 time
Open image for 30 time
ERROR 2: CPLMalloc(): Out of memory allocating -4 bytes.

I downlodaded many HDF4 images form the NASA ftp and this problem 
happens in all of them. Is there any limitation in the number of times I 
can open an HDF file with  many subdatasets? Maybe a bug?

Thank you!!
Best regards!

doh!

oops. oh well. I built a set of sample binary GRIDs for each of the 
possible bit depths. If they'd be of use to anyone I can pass 'em along.

Miguel,

I suspect you are running into:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1485

This fix was done after the 1.4.1 release, but should be available in the
nightly svn-stable snaphots.

I'm afraid but AFAIK there are no GDAL tutorials for VB.NET.
The only option I see is to check source code of ogr2ogr.cpp
and do some transition to .NET, using C# bindings.

I can use ogr in VB.NET through ogr_csharp.dll which is a wrapper.My 
problem is that I get confused about creating Drivers,Datasources etc.I 
just need some examples how to do that even in C#.

Until now I manage to Open a  Datasource and Create a Datasource.
The utility ogr2ogr converts shp to kml like that example:
ogr2ogr -f KML mypoints.kml sbpoints.shp

Question:
Is there any function which i can use to do tha progrmmatically OR I 
have to iterate in all the features of the Opened Datasource(shp) to the 
new Created DataSource(kml) and write each feature in that kml file?
My code until now:

        Dim ogr As New OSGeo.OGR.Ogr
        Dim kml As OSGeo.OGR.DataSource
        Dim driver As OSGeo.OGR.Driver
        Dim shp As OSGeo.OGR.DataSource
        Dim options(0) As String

        ogr.RegisterAll()
        shp = ogr.Open("c:\Point.kml", 0) 'Open a  Datasource
        driver = ogr.GetDriverByName("KML")
        options(0) = String.Empty
        kml = driver.CreateDataSource("C:\Point.kml", options) 'Create a 
Datasource

NEXT HOW TO IMPLEMENT ogr2ogr -f KML like in example?

Thank you for you help.Leonidas

Leonidas,

The latter is the only option you have.

> NEXT HOW TO IMPLEMENT ogr2ogr -f KML like in example?

The best place to learn how to implement it is to look at source
code of the ogr2ogr.cpp program and then implement similar logic in
in C#, VB.NET, ...

Leonidas,

You will need to do all the iteration over features.  There are no
convenience functions to encapsulate this.

Patrick,

I've been digging into:

   http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/1198

and added your notes.

But I'm still not clear on how the tile naming works, and without having
that well understood I think it is going to be hard for me to fix the driver.

Is there anyone on the list with Grid that would be willing to create some
test datasets in various sizes to try and work out the naming pattern?  If
so please add yourself to the trac bug cc: list, and add a note to the bug.

Best regards,
