I don't think so. Looks like an issue with your GDAL and/or proj.4 install.
The proj.4 string for EPSG:3857 reported above is wrong. It should be (as reported by gdalsrsinfo "EPSG:3857"):

+proj=merc +a=6378137 +b=6378137 +lat_ts=0.0 +lon_0=0.0 +x_0=0.0 +y_0=0 +k=1.0 +units=m +nadgrids=@null +wktext  +no_defs

It fails also here. I think that the problem comes from the projection
parameters stored in the PDF file (the scale factor is null).

Hi Konstantin,

Can you explain your case. For example for WMS driver (TMS) 
GDAL_HTTP_PROXY config option works for me.

Best regards,

Subject: [gdal-dev] Allocate large memory space with CPLMalloc(). Bug or not?
Message-ID: <1443727113353-5227443.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello!

Take a look on the following code:

*...
size_t w = 10000, h = 5000, d = 150;
size_t sz = w * h * d * sizeof(float); // ~27.94 Gb

float *volume = (float*)CPLMalloc(sz);
...*

In this case GDAL throws error in runtime: "ERROR 1: CPLMalloc(-664771072):
Silly size requested."
But I think that it's not silly, because such amount of free RAM is
available on my system. For example I can successfully allocate it calling
standart malloc().

I have opened CPLMalloc() source code and seen the following lines:

*void *CPLMalloc( size_t nSize ) 
...
    if( long(nSize) < 0 )
    {
        CPLError( CE_Failure, CPLE_AppDefined,
                  "CPLMalloc(%ld): Silly size requested.\n",
                  (long) nSize );
        return NULL;
    }
...*

In my case long( size_t nSize ) returns negative value and it leads to
error. 
As far as I understand converting one integer type to another smaller
integer type (e.g. long long/size_t to long) is implementation-defined, so
it's not safe to use CPLMalloc() with 64-bit integers.

CPLMalloc() is not meant at being used for big allocations since it aborts if 
the allocation fails. Use VSIMalloc() instead that will return NULL in case of 
failed alloc

According to the documentation, CPLMalloc is a convenience for
'smaller' allocations where the caller is 'unwilling to test for out
of memory conditions':

/**
 * Safe version of malloc().
 *
 * This function is like the C library malloc(), but raises a CE_Fatal
 * error with CPLError() if it fails to allocate the desired memory.  It
 * should be used for small memory allocations that are unlikely to fail
 * and for which the application is unwilling to test for out of memory
 * conditions.  It uses VSIMalloc() to get the memory, so any hooking of
 * VSIMalloc() will apply to CPLMalloc() as well.  CPLFree() or VSIFree()
 * can be used free memory allocated by CPLMalloc().
 *
 * @param nSize size (in bytes) of memory block to allocate.
 * @return pointer to newly allocated memory, only NULL if nSize is zero.
 */


Use the VSIMalloc*() family, it is just a wrapper for malloc, but
checks for overflow in VSIMalloc2(), VSIMalloc3().

Thanks for reply, I'll try VSIMalloc().
But can you explain the goal of check *if( long(nSize) < 0 ) {...}* in
CPLMalloc()? Cast size_t to long leads to implicit result.

I have a similar issue and supposedly a very simple question:
Given a file Geomedia .mdb file I'm getting a similar error on Windows.
% ogrinfo myfile.mdb -al -so
How does OGR recognize if it's a Personal Geodatabase or a Geomedia file?

Hi,
Look at http://www.gdal.org/ogr_formats.html

IIRC ogr2ogr needed that - but ogrinfo?  not sure - maybe the -oo param?

You could also use ogrinfo --formats
to see what's available on your system.

Hopefully others will chip in too.
Regards,
Zoltan

Zoltan

Yes, I'm testing GDAL 1.11.2, released 2015/02/10, in Windows which
supports PGeo and Geomedia.
My problem is, how can I tell ogrinfo's and ogr2ogr that myfile.mdb is
Geomedia and not PGeo (since both have fileextension .mdb)?

That's the command and the error messages I get:

They have a reason/plan for that:

"FLIF is currently licensed under the GNU GPL v3+. However, when the
project is more mature, we
(Jon Sneyers and Pieter Wuille, the primary authors of FLIF)
will want to release it under a more permissive license."

Well, explicitly naming the LGPL and any other GPL compatible license
pretty much opens things up.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Deviation with gdalwarp
Message-ID: <CAMCJChv3nD8QstZohOw7Fv6Kt1rc40x+zkDGbK=giD112qCMnw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I have a raster file (ascii) created through an IDW interpolation, with
spatial resolution of 12.5m. I'm using gdalwarp to clip the raster with a
polygon mask. I use the parameter "-tr 12.5 12.5" to keep the original
resolution.

However, the clipped raster is not with the pixels aligned to the original
raster pixels. It's like being moved slightly to one side (a distance less
than the size of a pixel).

Making the cut with Clip grid with polygon of SAGA GIS, the resulting
raster pixels keeps perfectly aligned to the original raster.

How can this deviation be explained with gdalwarp? In this case I have not
used any resampling or coordinate transformation, I just made the clip,
with the command:
gdalwarp -tr 12.5 12.5 -q -cutline D:\Testes\concelho.shp -crop_to_cutline
-of GTiff D:\Testes\idw.asc D:\Testes\idw_clip_gdalwarp.tif

I leave my tests data so you can see the shift that I'm talking about:

https://cld.pt/dl/download/2af4cb16-319f-4b43-988a-a529a9dc9806/Testes.zip

I'm using GDAL 1.11.2.

Thank you very much!

Best regards,
Pedro Ven?ncio

Could you make a new zip with some other program or settings? This one gets

Hi Jukka,

I think it is a problem with the hosting service... Sorry...

https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5772257/qgis/Testes.zip



Hi Even,


> This a known behaviour of gdalwarp. See
> https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4344
>
>
Yes, it is exactly this problem!

-crop_to_cutline (Crop the extent of the target dataset to the extent of
the cutline) adjusts the output raster to the cutting polygon limit, which
maybe why gdalwarp is using that 50% of the pixel to establish the limit.
So, seen from this perspective, I do not know if this is actually a GDAL
bug, because in reality it does what the parameter says, right?

gdalwarp tool used in QGIS is adding -crop_to_cutline parameter by default,
and it leads to the problem.

Thanks!

Best regards,
Pedro

A long while ago I called for maintainers as I have no means to keep it up.
I no longer use it myself and I don't think there is active user base, so
+1 from me.

Hi everybody,

I'm fixing some problem with a QGIS plugin, and I'm fighting with a
problem with postgis OGRFeature that it crash QGIS for a
__GI___libc_free problem. The log of gdb is available here [0].

The error appear at the end of write_layer_single function (line 204)
during the return of this file [1]. I tried to fix in several way, but
I'm not able to understand. The error appear only with
postgresql/postgis datasource, not with other.

Thanks a lot for any suggestion

Luca,

I'm not completely sure if this is the reason, but there's at least something 
to correct related to the use of:

self.feat_defn.AddFieldDefn(style_field)

Quoting OGRFeatureDefn::AddFieldDefn() documentation  
http://gdal.org/classOGRFeatureDefn.html#a40e681d8464b42f1a1fac655f16ac3dd :

"To add a new field definition to a layer definition, do not use this function 
directly, but use OGRLayer::CreateField() instead."

Hum actually looking more closely, I think the issue is that you modify the 
layer definition after having accumulated features in the "features" 
dictionary.

Still quoting OGRFeatureDefn::AddFieldDefn() documentation 
"This method should only be called while there are no OGRFeature objects in 
existance based on this OGRFeatureDefn."

So you should probably call outLayer.CreateField() before reading the postgres 
features.

CreateField works perfectly, I also removed the workaround for postgresql

Message-ID: <CAK4m-3wJjPT_cLJZuBYmCZ1_qwCO81sdD53r9ZGi30hyDJqrLA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi devs,

PDF driver is actually supporting only 8 bit band, and if I try to
create a layer using CreateCopy function with a dataset different from
8 bit I get "ERROR 6: PDF driver doesn't support data type UInt16.
Only eight bit byte bands supported."

I try to catch this error using try/except but it doesn't work, should
I test if the result of CreateCopy is not None? Is there any other
better way to catch this error?

thanks

Yes, either test for None return, or call gdal.UseExceptions() and then Python 
exceptions will be thrown when a GDAL error occurs.

No objections from me.

There are also traces of WIN32CE in other files (such as port/cpl_strtod.cpp)

I am looking for a script to combine two raster data that have unique values. For example, one raster has administrative unit name and another has land cover data. I want to combine these two raster data to find a relationship between two data. I can do the same process in another GIS software but wanted to find an option to do this using gdal. 

Any suggestion or help will be appreciated.

Hi,

I propose to add Kurt Schwehr to the GDAL project steering committee. 

Kurt has been a committer for 2 years, and over the last few months has 
substantially increased his level of involvment, mainly in the area of 
improving code quality, going through the Coverity Scan database of code 
defects, other code cleanups, test suite improvements, ... He has also confirm 
his interest in long term involvment in the project. I believe he would be a 
good asset for the project.

Motion: To add Kurt Schwehr to the GDAL PSC.

+1 from me.

Best regards,

Even

Dear Wangyal,

Well, with the Perl bindings you could do something like this (note: not 
tested code!). I'm assuming many things: the rasters are similar size, 
they are not too big so they fit into memory, etc.

use Modern::Perl;
use Geo::GDAL;

my ($admin,$lu) = @ARGV;

my $ds_admin = Geo::GDAL::Open($admin);
die "can't open $admin as a raster dataset" unless $ds_admin;

my $ds_lu = Geo::GDAL::Open($lu);
die "can't open $lu as a raster dataset" unless $ds_lu;

my $data_admin = $ds_admin->Band(1)->ReadTile;
my $data_lu = $ds_admin->Band(1)->ReadTile;

my %lu_at_admin; # will contain the number of cells of each land use in 
each admin area
for (my $y = 0; $y < @$data_admin-1; $y++) {
     my $row_admin = $data_admin->[$y];
     my $row_lu = $lu_admin->[$y];
     for (my $x = 0; $x < @$row_admin-1; $x++) {
         $lu_at_admin{$row_admin->[$x]}{$row_lu->[$x]}++;
     }
}

for my $admin (sort keys %lu_at_admin) {
     for my $lu (sort keys %{$lu_at_admin{$admin}}) {
         say "There are $lu_at_admin{$admin}{$lu} cells of land use $lu 
in admin area $admin.";
     }
}

Best,

Ari Jolma

Subject: [gdal-dev] NITF - EDIT TRE
Message-ID: <538E9F517DECA94A86A940F00577EACDF83412FA@MXHFA01.esl.corp.elbit.co.il>

Hi all,
I created a NITF file with my own TRE (not registered). Until here, everything is alright and I also getting the content of it using GetMetadataItem().
The problem is when I create a copy of the file on purpose to edit the data of the TRE.
I tried, as I do with the metadata, to use the creation options for it. The problem is that it makes a duplication of the TRE and I have the old and the new.
I understood from it that it is part of the dataset and the CreateCopy() cause it, so I tried not to add it to the creation options and to use the SetMetadataItem() instead, before calling the CreateCopy(), but I see no change is done.
Does someone have an idea how to solve it?

Hi all,

I see the OpenFileGDB supports only reading. Is any driver supporting write
filegeodb other than ESRI FileGeoDB driver ?

Gane,

no, for write support, you need currently to sue the (ESRI SDK based) FileGDB 
driver.

Write support in OpenFileGDB could potentially be added, with the exception of 
spatial indexes whose format hasn't been successfully reverse engineered up to 
now.

Hi all,

Its about redistributing the ESRI FileGeoDB binary with an application,
what are
the conditions enforced for a free application and a paid application
closed source application.

I see post and blogs and I am not still clear.

WindowsCE/WinCE/WIN32_WCE has been removed (except in third party libs).

See https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6133 for the 6 changes that remove
it.

People who can build on (non-WinCE) Windows, please build from head if you
can.  I would appreciate knowing if I somehow broke Windows builds so I can
get it fixed ASAP.  I don't think I did, but all I have to go on is the
MingW Travis-CI builds.

Cheers,

Just reminding everyone that there are AppVeyor Windows builds running each 
time SVN changes are mirrored to GIT ( every 15 minutes ) :

Kurt,

I have checked building latest trunk on Windows 8.1 with VS2015 and 32-bit
build seems fine.

Mateusz, Thanks for the build test.  Even, thanks for the pointer to the
Appveyor builds.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Unable to compile Gdal under Cygwin
Message-ID: <22039.61358.657000.718699@woitok.gmail.com>

Greetings,

yesterday I cloned the Gdal source repository from

   https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal.git

and converted  it to a Mercurial repository,  simply  because that's the
version control software I'm at home with.  In Mercurial the most recent
commit of the repository looks like this

   2015-10-08 13:48:32 +0000 even.rouault at mines-paris.org

   test_gdal_grid_lib_1(): fix failure when GEOS not available

   git-svn-id: https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk at 30908 f0d54148-0727-0410-94bb-9a71ac55c965

   M autotest/utilities/test_gdal_grid_lib.py

and the corresponding Git revision of this commit most probably is

   592b969358dba7119acb24bdac2a204808ff96d4

I then tried to compile Gdal  under a reasonably current version of Cyg-
win as a non-privileged user running

   ./configure --mandir=$REPO/share/man  \
               --prefix=$REPO            \
               --with-geotiff=internal   \
               --with-gif=internal       \
               --with-jpeg=internal      \
               --with-libjson-c=internal \
               --with-libtiff=internal   \
               --with-libz=internal      \
               --with-pcidsk=internal    \
               --with-pcraster=internal  \
               --with-perl=no            \
               --with-png=internal       \
               --with-python=yes         \
               --with-qhull=internal
   make clean
   make install        # This automatically also makes target "default".

Things went well until  "make" entered directory "swig/python/" where it
produced plenty of warnings (which may or may not be relevant to my cur-
rent problem) and terminated with the error message "collect2: error: ld
returned 1 exit status".  I have included the log from where "make" ent-
ers directory "swig/python/" up to the final error below.

On the Gdal webpage at  "http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/BuildingOnUnix"
I found  the hint to  use the "configure" option "--with-pymodir=direct-
ory", but this is rejected with

   configure: WARNING: unrecognized options: --with-pymodir

What am I missing?  Any pointers welcome.

A few additional remarks:

"configure" is issuing a message saying "checking for shared library run
path origin... /bin/sh: ./config.rpath:  No such file or directory", but
a script "config.rpath" is not (and never was) contained in the reposit-
ory I cloned.

"config.status" is issuing a  warning saying "'GDALmake.opt.in' seems to
ignore the --datarootdir setting",  and according to my own observations
either "configure" or "GDALmake.opt"  ignore the "--mandir" setting  and
just use "PREFIX/man", regardless.

The webpage  already mentioned  above is also  saying that  under Cygwin
"shared libraries are not supported", which is sort of wrong, since Cyg-
win uses Windows DLLs which should just be stored in "PREFIX/bin".

Sincerely,
  Rainer

Dmitry,

It seems the error is linked to the Python GNM module when GDAL is not 
configured --with-gnm.

On Linux, this seems to compile, although at runtime, I can see that 
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/84538954/log.txt shows 
errors like :

... failed to load gnm_test.py ... skipping.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "pymod/gdaltest.py", line 244, in run_all
    exec("import " + module)
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "./gnm_test.py", line 43, in <module>
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/osgeo/gnm.py", line 28, in <module>
    _gnm = swig_import_helper()
  File "/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/osgeo/gnm.py", line 24, in 
swig_import_helper
    _mod = imp.load_module('_gnm', fp, pathname, description)
ImportError: /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/osgeo/_gnm.so: undefined symbol: 
_ZTI10GNMNetwork

I guess that on Cygwin symbol resolution is done at linking time, hence the 
error. Perhaps the building of the Python gnm module should be 
conditionnalized to GNM_ENABLED ?

Subject: [gdal-dev] Creating plugins for most formats
Message-ID: <CA+nQOR--u0XPMBKhxvGcjaoh46hPoGgC_MW8_RshKB6_yk9=nw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am curious how hard it would be to build the core GDAL/OGR libs, then
have most formats created as driver plugins, instead of directly linked
from the main libs?

Reason: at Homebrew (and in other situations) every time one of the linked
libs is updated then GDAL/OGR has to be rebuilt as well. An ideal situation
is where the core libs do not need rebuilt except upon patches or updates
to non-format-specific portions of the code base. Then, format plugins are
rebuilt as necessary, relative to their external dependencies; and, all
plugins rebuilt when a core libs update requires it.

Currently I find compiling driver plugins tedious, at least for
1.x versions, has this changed with 2.x versions? Is there an easier way to
compile a format as a .so driver plugin than the following 'manual'
example, or am I just doing it in a tedious manner?

Subject: [gdal-dev] gdalUtils (GDAL/OGR for R) now on CRAN
Message-ID: <CABG0rfuwEf-jMfdk8hvfCqRbcz9cB+CqW5459xXL+Med3DeZdw@mail.gmail.com>

Folks:

I wanted to let you know I've pushed a major release of my gdalUtils
package to CRAN in the last week.  This wraps all non-python GDAL/OGR
utilities as of GDAL 2.0.1 for use in R, and provides some value-added
functions as well.

install.packages("gdalUtils")
should work for all OSs, or if you want the bleeding edge version, use:
install.packages("gdalUtils", repos="http://R-Forge.R-project.org")

Note this is not the same as rgdal -- my package simply wraps the gdal
binaries, which must be pre-installed by the user.

Cheers!

Jonathan,

You might take advantage of the librarification of those utilities that is 
currently taking place for GDAL 2.1 (work in progress) :

No. Just a few more drivers can be compiled as plugins in trunk (HDF4, HDF5, 
GeoRaster, FileGDB, OCI and PG)

No easy way. You can still do it manually by linking to the required libraries 
and GDAL core.

Perhaps that could be an interesting objective if a CMake build system comes 
true (although can be tricky since there are sometimes interdependencies 
between drivers).

Dear GDLALers,

recently we tested the following 3 JPEG2000 drivers: JP2ECW, JPEG2000,
and JP2OpenJPEG.  A jp2 file was opened by all three drivers and we
tested whether the decoded image were equal. To our suprise they are
not: theJPEG2000 and JP2OpenJPEG lead to the same decoded image but they
differ from the one obtained with JP2ECW.  Is this a bug in the
implementation of the JP2ECW driver or is there any rationale explanation?

Thanks a lot in advance,

Pierre

Pierre,

I don't think the differences come from the GDAL drivers, but rather from 
differences/bugs/features of the underlying libraries. Regarding JP2ECW, I 
recall to have observed differences depending if you read component per 
component or all components together. The version of the JP2 ECW SDK might 
also have some influence.

Message-ID: <2A147272-1CC3-43A0-B5D0-38AAA5436C8A@di.uoa.gr>

Hi all,

Recently I noticed that the ExportToWKT <http://gdal.org/java/org/gdal/ogr/Geometry.html#ExportToWkt()> function of a Geometry object that has been read from a Shapefile, generates the well known text representation without any compromise on the precision of the coordinates values.

I wonder how these coordinates are represented in memory. A double precision floating type is not enough to represent some coordinates.

For example the geometry POINT (4799826.09861662145704 2773995.445373429451138) cannot be represented by two double types. But still the ExportToWKT function produces the correct result with full precision for the values.

Thnks,
Dimis

Dimitrianos,

The implementation of ExportToWKT() in GDAL uses 15 decimal figures ("%.15f" 
printf formatting) whatever the source precision was, and as you point, 
whatever the intrinsic precision of the double value is.

Ok, I thought, if the missing "--with-gnm" option spoils my compilation,
I could as well add it.  And lo and behold! the compilation succeeded.

But what,  apart from a successful compilation,  does this option really
buy me?  The command "configure --help" only tells me

which doesn't really convey any information.

I should have suggested the workaround, sorry.

I've created https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6144 to track the issue.

Does "%.15f" have any added value over "%.15g" (in the usual real-life 
GIS situations, I mean). I also vaguely remember some posting/ticket 
about "%.15f" versus "%.15g", including a request to partially revert a 
changeset. This was years ago, and I can't find at the moment.

The earlier issue was related to some change in the AAIGrid writer, 
http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3732. As hamish (from the GRASS 
community) wrote at the end of the ticket: "I'd point out that for IEEE 
double precision floating point you don't gain anything by going past 
%.17g."

Hum I thought that WKT didn't allow scientific notation for coordinates, but 
actually checking at http://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id=25355 
(SFA 1.2.1), page 52, it seems legal. So perhaps this could be changed.

A quick test with OpenJUMP proofs that JTS can handle WKT like "POINT

Hi,

Were the original JPEG2000 files lossy or lossless? Getting slightly
different results from lossy files does not feel critical but lossless
conversion should naturally be lossless. It looks like I have seen an issue
with ECWJP2 driver (SDK 3.x) a few years ago
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2009-January/019588.html

I suppose that with the SDK v. 3.x the irreversible 9/7 trasformation was
used also for reversible compression and/or decompression instead of the 5/3
transformation. I am not sure if the bug was ever corrected for SDK 3.x.
Please make a test and report the results. If the bug is still there I
suppose that it will never be fixed but at least we could document it
because SDK 3.x is still used due to its more allowing license.

Thanks you for the quick answer!
Actually I was confused at some point, because some geometries had the exact precision as in the Shapefile,
and some other not. 

Thanks again,
Dimitrianos

Now on to testing: plenty of tests failing due to

   ERROR 6: Unable to load PROJ.4 library (cygproj-0.dll)

Well, the real  PROJ.4 library  is meanwhile named  "cygproj-10.dll" and
resides in a directory mentioned in  environment variable "PATH".  Where
does the name "cygproj-0.dll" come from?   Can I do something about that
(other than linking statically via "--with-static-proj4=...")?

Somehow I  don't quite  like the idea  of renaming my  PROJ.4 library to
what Gdal currently thinks is the right name :-(

Sincerely,

Ah, yes I guess it comes from latest proj version where the soname was bumped. 
Well you can safely rename/copy cygproj-10.dll as cygproj-0.dll to please what 
is currently hardcoded in ogr/ogrct.cpp

--with-static-proj4 is probably the cleanest alternative rather than dynamic 
loading.

While thinking twice about the issue (I might be wrong, though): Isn't 
it more of a generic problem that by far most reals (of which there are 
infinite many) cannot be *exactly* represented by half, single, double, 
quadruple-precision, or by whatever other floating-point format that 
could ever be invented in the future? In these cases, the "most accurate 
representation" must simply be good enough, as one can't do much about it?

Your sample value above is 4799826.09861662145704 (decimal):
The most accurate representation as double is: 
4.79982609861662145704030990601E6 (decimal), 0x41524F54864FBC17 (hex) 
and : 01000001 01010010 01001111 01010100 10000110 01001111 10111100 
00010111 (binary). That's just how it is, or is there another problem, 
of which I wouldn't be aware?

I took the "most accurate" values from 
http://www.binaryconvert.com/result_double.html

@Even: I also tried to imagine a reasonable real-life coordinate value 
that would generate scientific notation when printed with "%.15g" or: 
"%.17g" (as hamish mentioned in this old ticket). Can you point me to one?

You are right.

I just wondering if GDAL make use of any kind of custom-user-defined type that provides higher precision from a double. 
My question wasn’t so clear. The problem started comparing GDAL’s and GeoTools’ (Java) WKT representations of the same geometries that has been read from the same Shapefile.
I noticed that GDAL provides higher accuracy than GeoTools. So I asked this question here, wondering whether GDAL is using something else than just doubles in memory. 
But I also concluded that in fact JAVA  and C doubles have the same representation in memory by running some minimal tests. 
However in Java, when converting a double into string, it even with (“.15f”) format, it does not give the same string value as doing so in C.

Hmm. I'm not a programmer of any kind and only know doubles and their 
siblings as defined by IEEE 754. I doubt that any serious programming 
language could have an interest in ignoring this standard.

 > GDAL provides higher accuracy..

Hmm. My observation is rather that when exporting into text formats 
(AAIGrid, WKT, etc.), GDAL seems to print more "numbers" (actually: 
longer string values) than meaningful in the given context. A double is 
a double is a double, and can only be as accurate as defined by IEEE 
754. I am quoting hamish once again: "I'd point out that for IEEE double 
precision floating point you don't gain anything by going past %.17g."

Just to quote another source (Wikipedia): If an IEEE 754 double 
precision is converted to a decimal string with at least 17 significant 
digits and then converted back to double, then the final number must 
match the original.[1]

I assume it is clear now that the conclusion "I see many numbers", so 
this format "must have higher accuracy" can indeed be wrong.

I was wondering if there is a list, for each projection supported by 
OGR, reasonable default values for each projection parameter. For 
example, if the user is switching projections in an app, a small table 
listing the projection parameters appears, but they need to be populated 
with reasonable default values.

e.g. for the New Zealand Mining Grid, one could do
spatialRef.SetNZMG(centerLat = 41, centerLong = 173, 
falseEasting=2510000, falseNorthing=6023150);

Hi, everybody:

I'm now trying to write polygonized result into an esri shapefile, and I
tried

to add some field to the attribute table in the shapefile. But it corrupted

when i was trying to create an *ogrfielddefn* instance.The code goes

like this:
           OGRFieldDefn oField("归一化植被指数",OFTInteger);
           if(poLayer->CreateField(&oField) != OGRERR_NONE)
           {
                printf("create 归一化植被指数 failed!");

Are you using the "ENCODING" option as described here?

http://www.gdal.org/drv_shapefile.html
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/4359

And double-check that you're using the same encoding in your source code

Hi, everybody:

add one more question :

the field name can be read 10 ascii characters, the last characters would
be

trimmed, is there anyone encounter this problem?

any help would be appreciated!

Not necessarily 10 ascii characters, but 10 bytes. The number of characters 
that can fit on 10 bytes depends on the encoding. 1 ASCII character = 1 byte. 
But for non ASCII characters such as Chinese characters, one character fits on 
several bytes.

> is there anyone encounter this problem?

Yes, everybody ! This is a limitation of the > 30 year old DBF format.

I've tried the following Python script that creates a shapefile with the CP936 
encoding.

{{{
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

from osgeo import ogr

ds = ogr.GetDriverByName('ESRI Shapefile').CreateDataSource('test_cp936.dbf')
lyr = ds.CreateLayer('test_cp936', options = ['ENCODING=CP936'])
lyr.CreateField(ogr.FieldDefn("归一化植被指数",ogr.OFTInteger))
}}}

It emits a warning about truncation since the field name cannot fit on 10 bytes 
once recoded in CP936.

Here's the result:

$ ogrinfo cp936.dbf -al
INFO: Open of `cp936.dbf'
      using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.

Layer name: cp936
Metadata:
  DBF_DATE_LAST_UPDATE=2015-10-12
Geometry: Line String
Feature Count: 0
Extent: (0.000000, 0.000000) - (0.000000, 0.000000)
Layer SRS WKT:
(unknown)
归一化植被: Integer (9.0)

So the last 2 characters are lost.

Yes.

Do you really need shapefile though ? If not, you could use more modern formats 
like GeoPackage or Spatialite that don't suffer from shapefile limitations : 
http://www.gdal.org/drv_geopackage.html , http://www.gdal.org/drv_sqlite.html

Potential idea if you need to stick with shapefiles: according to Google 
Translate this field name is translated in to English as Normalized Difference 
Vegetation Index, and in English it is often just abbreviated with its well-
known acronym NDVI. Perhaps there's the equivalent of acronyms in Chinese ?

No, it is unlikely that coordinates go that big in any reasonable projected 
coordinate system. Unless perhaps if you are far away from the validity area 
of the PCS.

I've changed to '%.15g' formatting for WKT in

Even,

thanks for your reply.  The tested version of the JP2 ECW SDK is 3.3. 
Regarding the comment by Jukka, I ran jhove on the jp2 file and got
(among many other infos) the following:
    CodingStyleDefault:
      CodingStyle: 0
      ProgressionOrder: 0
      NumberOfLayers: 1
      MultipleComponentTransformation: 0
      NumberDecompositionLevels: 5
      CodeBlockWidth: 4
      CodeBlockHeight: 4
      CodeBlockStyle: 0
      Transformation: 1

My understanding is that 'Transformation: 1' refers to a lossless
representation.  If this is confirmed, the JP2 ECW SDK driver v.3.3
should be used with care since it returns values that are not correct. 
Actually, even in the case of lossy compression, I would expect
different drivers to return exactly the same result (as it happens for
the JEG2000 and JP2OpenJPEG drivers in our test).

Many thanks,

Pierre

Yes, if they have output the values of the SPcod field, 1 means 5-3 reversible.

Alternatively you can use the dump_jp2.py script mentionned at 
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/JPEG2000Utils

Actually, having the 5-3  reverse transformation is a necessary condition for 
lossless conversion, but not a sufficient one : you also need to have enough 
quality layers encoded, but AFAIK that cannot be trivially checked from 
looking at the codestream parameters.

Yes, the ECW SDK v3.3 has a number of more or less known issues. Most of them 
have likely be fixed by later versions (that are binary only)
For completness, I think I've also seen issues where decoding (or perhaps 
encoding? I don't remember) of lossless images with 12 bit depth with openjpeg 
that didn't lead to original values.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Error reading raster data for row xxx (only when using
	r.series and t.rast.series)
Message-ID: <CAOGWcHJZqKmZ1NmXg=rPdr6y-NvdYgNgD-ww-TR3VNJm4CYWoA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Over the last couple of years I have noticed a very strange raster
corruption (?) issues when using r.series, and now more recently,
t.rast.series. Typically, I'll generate a large number of maps with
r.sun or t.rast.mapcalc and then aggregate the series with r.series or
t.rast.series. About 50% of the time the command runs as expected, the
other half of the time r.series or t.rast.series gives me an error
like this:

Error reading raster data for row xxx (testmap)

After this error, I can no longer perform any kind of operation on map
"testmap" without the dreaded Error reading raster data for row xxx...

The situation was worse when using a MASK map, possibly related to a
similar (fixed?) issue discussed in this thread:

http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/grass-dev/2015-July/075627.html

Within that thread, Glynn mentioned that this type of error was
probably related to pthreads and concurrent processes. The temporary
fix entailed:

export WORKERS=0

I have tried this on my machine but the results are the same,
non-deterministic corruption (?) of one input to r.series or
t.rast.series.

I have encountered this error on several disks, mirrored HDDs, single
HDD, and now on an SSD. I don't think that this is a disk problem,
rather, something that r.series or t.rast.series is "doing" to the
files it operates on.

Is there some possibility that one of these commands is leaving a file
"open" or in some kind of intermediate state that prevents subsequent
commands from accessing the file?

I'll try to create a sample dataset to send over. In the meantime is
there any kind of diagnostic information that I can report back with?

Thanks,
Dylan

I am working with the lastest stable build of GDAL source 2.0.1.

In Mac when I run configure I get this enabled,
what is the use of this.
How to disable this like --with-libiconv and start building gdal ?

Gane,

I'm not sure to understand if you want to enable or disable building GDAL with 
iconv support

iconv is needed when translating between "exotic" encodings and UTF-8. You may 
need it for shapefiles with non ASCII characters for example. Other drivers may 
require it as well.

Looking at our MacOSX continuous integration instance ( 
https://s3.amazonaws.com/archive.travis-ci.org/jobs/85047538/log.txt ), it 
seems that you don't need to do anything to have GDAL to build and run 
properly with iconv support.

If you want to disable iconv support, as far as I can see, there's no 
./configure switch to do that if it is detected. You have to edit manually 
port/cpl_config.h after configure has run to remove "#define HAVE_ICONV 1" and 
look for the line "LIBICONV        =" in GDALmake.opt to ensure there's 
nothing after the equal sign.

# Questions :)

* is it possible to choose the driver used by gdal? For instance, in my second 
test, my gdal install have two driver; ECW SDK and OpenJpeg. Currently, I am 
building several gdal instance to test each driver :/
* the difference between the two test, is it a problem from the driver used of 
from gdal release?

Thanks,

Y.

Yes, see https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/ConfigOptions#GDAL_SKIP

For example if you want to exclude the JPEG2000 and JP2OpenJPEG drivers and 
only use JP2ECW:

GDAL_SKIP="JPEG2000,JP2OpenJPEG" gdalinfo foo.jp2

> * the difference between the two test, is it a problem from the driver used

It is (mainly) a problem of the underlying library.
The JPEG2000 driver uses the jasper library which needs to decompress the 
whole imagine into memory. For some reason due to how jasper works, to get the 
infos displayed by gdalinfo, we also need to decompress the imagery. Could 
perhaps be made smarter, but as soon as you would need to query the value of a 
single pixel, the whole image would be uncompressed, so...
Other JPEG2000 drivers (and underlying libraries) are smarter and will only 
decompress(*) the requested area (and nothing for just a simple gdalinfo).

Even

(*) in the case of JP2OpenJPEG, this is only true if the JPEG2000 image is 
tiled. If it is made of a single tile, requesting just a few pixels will be 
slow (but will not need a lot of RAM as far as I remember)

Exactly what I need, I should read this page one of this day because I know 
that it exists but never read it :)

Interesting, so my thought to try with openjpg2000 is correct.

Subject: [gdal-dev] The new @filename syntax and UTF-8 with BOM
Message-ID: <loom.20151013T125917-340@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

While testing the new ogr2ogr and ogrinfo option that was introduced in
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/30859 for reading contents for the
-where and -sql parameters from a file by using the @filename syntax I
noticed that system fails if the option file is saved with the Byte order
mark (BOM)

ERROR 1: SQL Expression Parsing Error: syntax error, unexpected end of
string. Occured around :
´╗┐{"query":

If I save the option file as UTF-8 without BOM then the file is read
correctly. Could GDAL be made to clarify the BOM if it exists, or should we
document that BOM is banned?

And now I understand why some of my mapfiles which I had to convert into
UTF-8 for Mapserver v. 7.0 did not work - the same BOM issue there.

Subject: [gdal-dev] How to find image footprints instead of envelopes?
Message-ID: <loom.20151013T131129-211@post.gmane.org>

Hi,

This question appears every now and then in the gis.stackexchange and I have
been wondering about it by myself as well: How to generate a footprint
polygon of the real image data area so that the possible nodata areas would
not be included?

I have been thinking that I could convert the original image into a new
image with alpha channel or a one-bit image with nodata=0 and yesdata=1 and
then polygonize the alpha band or the 1-bit image with gdal_polygonize.py. I
guess that it would work but it feels a bit complicated. Is there any more
direct way for doing this task with GDAL? I bet that at least someone has
written a python script for it because the need is so obvious.

It seems that GDAL_SKIP="JPEG2000,JP2OpenJPEG" is not working for gdal 1.11 I 
should use ' ' rather than ",".

Do you know any build issue on trunk or 1.10? I can't build this release from 
git repository.

Do you know any limitation on jp2OpenJpeg? I get a segmentation fault with 
this driver:

Here is the bt (from gdal 1.11, but get almost the same from trunk, line 
number is different):

Yves,

I think someone has already had that issue. I think you're compiling against 
OpenJPEG 2.0 header and are linking against OpenJPEG 2.1 (or the reverse). 
Some structures of openjpeg have changed sizes between both versions and 
result in such a typical mess at runtime.

Even,

Strange. GDAL 1.10 + OpenJPEG2000 2.0 worked as expected but I am rather sure 
that I build OpenJpeg 2.1 just before the test.

Is it possible that there is a problem between GDAL 2.11 and OpenJPEG2000 
v2.0? I will test it again.

Last question for today: do you know any limitation with this lib (any 
release) and image size:

ERROR 1: Cannot handle box sizes higher than 2^32

OPENJPEG: info: Start to read j2k main header (349).
ERROR 1: Prevent buffer overflow (x1: 200000, y1: 225000)

You can get the image to polygonize with :
gdal_translate in.tif mask.tif -b mask

That should work with images with nodata or alpha channel.

None that I can think of.

gdal_polygonize.py would possibly do a bit more work than really needed in 
case there are holes of nodata inside the raster and you're not interested in 
such holes.

(OpenJPEG 2.1 support is new in GDAL 2.0)

It ought to work fine. This is the setup tested on Travis CI :

This error message comes from openjpeg itself. Is it really a huge JPEG2000 
files, ie more than 4 GB ? Not sure if I tried files that big with OpenJPEG.

This error messages comes from OpenJPEG 2.1 lib. Hum it would seem that the 
lib cannot handle images bigger than 4 billion pixels...

Jukka,

Have a look at Dan Stahlke's code he wrote when at GINA, I think
gdal_trace_ooutline will do what you want:

all the drivers code go within gdal200.dll or any dependency exists ?

Sorry to spam you :)

We tested with a jp2 file from autotest directory: 3_13bit_and_1bit.jp2, 
OpenJpeg lib 2.0 and GDAL 1.11.

We had the same problem. Building gdal with debug mode we had the following

So gdal or the openjpeg lib mix information (check width and height for each 
bands).

We updated openjpeg lib to 2.1 and gdalinfo worked as expected.

We will test gdal 1.10 with OpenJpeg 2.0 to check that the problem is already 
there as we would like to use GDAL 1.10 but I am afraid we should use gdal 
1.11 and OpenJpeg 2.1.

Does all the drivers code go within gdal200.dll or any dependency exists ?

I would use Dependency walker for checking that. You will find loads of
dependencies.

compatible with Gdal 1.x (> 1.10) and gdal 2.x. I am almost done but I 
am having a hard time figuring out how to test capabilities on a (former 
OGR) driver.

Indeed, I can see in ogrsf_frmts.h that OGRSFDriver::TestCapability() is 
deprecated :

virtual int            TestCapability( const char *pszCap ) 
OGR_DEPRECATED("Use GDALDriver class instead") = 0;

However, I can not find such a service in GDALDriver class ... The only 
TestCapability I found is the one of GDALDataset.

I am specifically trying to test the ODrCDeleteDataSource capability on 
the driver, and I can not use the GDALDataset::TestCapability() for that 
(or at least it is not listed in supported capabilities in doxygen of 
this method [1]).

What am I missing here ?

Thanks a lot for your replies,

Regards,

Julien

Message-ID: <CABqTJk-G9Wzzic27+DF2+LzhSrNUeOmsaN5GQUyu5iQtFymNxw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I'm trying to test using gdal the access to an oracle dbms.

To do this I use the ogrinfo and try this sintax but without success.

ogrinfo OCI:username:password@"(DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS
= (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = <IP server dbms>)(PORT = <listener
port>)))(CONNECT_DATA = (SID =<the sid of dbms>))):<schema>.<table>"

The server return

ERROR 1: ORA-01005: null password given; logon denied
 in <unnamed>

I guess the sintax is wrong , but don't know how otherwise pass to the
connection the url and the SID to the dbms

Any help is welcome.

Hi,

thx for help.

The solution reported me from Rèmy work good.
My error was to use the ":" instead of "/" to separate username and password.
So the right sintax is:

ogrinfo OCI:username/password@"(DESCRIPTION = (ADDRESS_LIST = (ADDRESS
= (PROTOCOL = TCP)(HOST = <IP server dbms>)(PORT = <listener
port>)))(CONNECT_DATA = (SID =<the sid of dbms>))):<schema>.<table>"

Regards.

Don'n you have a record for your connection in the tnsnames.ora
http://orafaq.com/wiki/Tnsnames.ora? If you have, use @SERVICE_NAME with ogrinfo

Read also carefully the manual page http://www.gdal.org/drv_oci.html
You wrote OCI:username:password  but it should be
OCI:username/password at database_instance:table,table

As documented "ogrinfo OCI:username/password at database_instance" is enough
but at least in our environment it can take several minutes to read the
metadata from Oracle if table list is not given for limiting the search.

Nothing. There's no equivalent for ODrCDeleteDataSource indeed. In GDAL 
drivers (and thus vector drivers that have been converted to GDAL drivers), 
the Delete() capability is implemented in a generic way by querying the list 
of files that make the dataset and delete them. Drivers may provide a dedicated 
implementation instead of that generic one.
Without a dataset, there's no way to know in advance if calling Delete() is 
going to do something or not. That's perhaps missing indeed.

A potential workaround is to query drivers for GDAL_DMD_CONNECTION_PREFIX 
metadata item that is set for (hopefully most) drivers that are not file based, 
and for which Delete() is generally going to raise an error at runtime.

>>> from osgeo import gdal
>>> gdal.GetDriverByName('MYSQL').Delete('MYSQL:autotest')
ERROR 6: Unable to determine files associated with MYSQL:autotest,
delete fails.
3
>>> gdal.GetDriverByName('MYSQL').GetMetadataItem(gdal.DMD_CONNECTION_PREFIX)
'MYSQL:'
>>>

Subject: [gdal-dev] Cross platform gdal.jar
Message-ID: <ea-mime-561e149f-4351-4a27d1cb@www-1.netcourrier.com>

Hi there,


I want to use the version 2.0.1 of gdal via the swig java bindings. I downloaded the windows version and install it on my machine and made my developments. I deployed my program on a Fedora machine. As there is no way (or I haven't found it) to download any Fedora binaries in 2.0.1 version, I compiled it. But when I run my program with windows version of the gdal.jar, I have some errors Unsatisfiedlinkerror. So I built the gdal.jar on the Fedora machine and it works, but I am not satisfied with this as I have to play with 2 versions of gdal.jar.



So my question is, is it possible to have the same gdal.jar for windows and linux platform ? Can I compile the linux version so the binairies will be the same as the windows one and swig interfaces could be the same, which are the compile options ?



Thanks for any reply,



Sebastien

Thanks Thomas,

By looking at the number of different options and comments in the code this
tool is very feature rich and obviously used for real production. The
license seems to be BSD http://www.freebsd.org/copyright/license.html. I
wonder if this tool could be reviewed and possibly added to GDAL utilities.

Jukka,

I guess that it could make sense for some of them, but that would require a 
champion to integrate them, document them, add tests, possibly turn them as 
library functions per RFC 59.1, make sure they compile and run fine on all our 
targets, etc... and maintain them in the long run. I also see a dependency to 
boost (http://www.boost.org/) that we've avoided up to now in GDAL core.

Note that you can also use what Oracle calls the ezconnect syntax which is
user/pass at host:port/service_name. Then no TNS is needed. Also note that
port only needs to be specified if its not 1521.

Jukka,

Yes, I've written the Python script to do this. If you're willing to
install Rasterio (which is GDAL and underneath, but new bindings and not
osgeo.gdal) you can use its rio-shapes command (based on GDAL's
polygonizer):

https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio/blob/master/docs/cli.rst#shapes

The script's entry point is at
https://github.com/mapbox/rasterio/blob/master/rasterio/rio/features.py#L197.
You're welcome to port it to GDAL's Python bindings; swapping out rasterio
and swapping in osgeo.gdal wouldn't be terribly hard.

Yes it is a huge file (25 Go), I find the error message in the code of OpenJpeg:
https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/blob/f8c822266043a689055b44274c0bf4dc34d4c8ba/src/lib/openjp2/jp2.c#L509

I find a ticket also: https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/issues/92

FYI, gdalinfo on the same jp2 with openjpeg and ECW SDK shows better 
performance with openjpeg driver.

Reading the same file with QGIS with both drivers shows a huge difference (read 
really better performance) for ECW SDK.

I need to do some test with MapServer but currently I can't be sure that GDAL 
use the correct driver.

done, performance are really poor with OpenJpeg driver. There is an issue with 
index in openjpeg lib. I don't how much it can be related to this.

Thanks Even for your help! You win a beer next time I see you.

Subject: [gdal-dev] How to write WKB as string?
Message-ID: <CAOL+ROGbx261Myz_kepN6udxuo_5RLGSpgvmog=jjbtNPF2B8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I have a tool which currently exports geometry using the ExportToWkt()
function.  It works great, but I'd like to try reducing the size of my
output files by using a format like the string representation of WKB that
shp2pgsql produsces when creating SQL insert files.  Is there a export
function available in GDAL that I could use for this?

I'm looking at http://www.gdal.org/classOGRGeometry.html currently, but
have not yet spotted what I'm looking for.

Thanks,

Roger

Wasn't OGRGeometry::exportToWkb() obvious enough ;-) ?

Just gave RFC 60 a quick look.  In general, I think we absolutely need
this.  Some thoughts:

- There are users who need the old behavior.  We need an easy way to get
that.  I think the default should be the more functional RFC 60 way.  I see
the -noNativeData flag, so I think this is well covered.
- What is the likely performance impact +/-?
- It would be nice to base a could use cases described in the RFC so we are
not totally counting on the links.  They don't have to be super detailed.
- Do we need to add anything to the JSON to flag which conversion method
was used?

<grin>  Yes Even, exportToWkb() was something I tried, but I thought there
might be an easy way to get the ASCII form of the WKB, rather than the
straight binary that I got when I wrote out to a text file.

Norman, thanks for the links. I'll go peruse them.

Theoretically, as that adds some new code, there could be some potential 
impact since we are going to always store the nativeData when reading, even if 
discarding it later. Hard to quantify at that point. If that were going to be 
a real problem (but anyone wanting performance shouldn't use geojson to start 
with), we could have an open option in the geojson driver to request it not to 
populate nativeData.

Ah I missed that part.

The following should help:

http://www.gdal.org/cpl__string_8h.html:

char * 	CPLBinaryToHex (int nBytes, const GByte *pabyData) 
CPL_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT
 	Binary to hexadecimal translation. More...
 
GByte * 	CPLHexToBinary (const char *pszHex, int *pnBytes) 
CPL_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT

Even more compact with base64 encoding:

char * 	CPLBase64Encode (int nBytes, const GByte *pabyData) 
CPL_WARN_UNUSED_RESULT
 
int 	CPLBase64DecodeInPlace (GByte *pszBase64)

Ahh, thanks!  It helps to frame the question correctly.  I see now that
what I am trying to do is create the hex-encoded form of WKB.

I'll be happy to round up a few extension datasets.

Kurt, do you mean that the output JSON would have a item indicating whether
it was a high fidelity or lossy translation of the input?

Sean got what I was meaning to say.  Do we want the output to have some
record of which mode was used.  I think the answer is likely no.  And it
reminds me that I need to think about a driver for writing ISO metadata
files.  (bleck)  The processing steps would go in an xml iso metadata
sidecar.

Kurt,
A driver for writing ISO metadata files would be quite welcome. Anything to
make compiling and writing metadata less painful is always a good thing.

Placeholder for we I or anybody else gets time to work on metadata
driver(s).

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6154

Doug,

If you have any key example files that would work well for test coverage,
feel free to attach them to the ticket.  I know we need a pretty wide range
or a driver will just frustrate people.  BAGs are all I'm really familiar
with, and I know their embedded iso xml is very different than others I was
shown when I when to a metadata workshop back 5 ish years ago.

I agree, no. Without a larger provenance framework of some kind there's not
much to be done with that information. And such a provenance framework (
http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ for example) covers this kind of thing already.

Do you mean you are trying to build GDAL for Windows CE
or Windows desktop?

Old Windows CE projects are still available here
https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/tags/2.0.1/gdal/wince/


If you are asking about Windows desktop, here is script that can generate
VS solution/project files:
https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/makegdal_gen.bat
Notice, generated project still uses NMAKE and makefiles.

p.s. Please, post to gdal-dev so others have access to any solutions we discuss.

I have just checked:

1) Launch cmd.exe and run makegdal_gen.bat 10.00 > makegdal14.vcproj
2) Load makegdal14.vcproj into VS2015 IDE
3) Confirm you want to upgrade and makegdal14.vcxproj + makegdal14.sln
are generated

Works for me.

It is just a convenience proxy for NMAKE /f makefile.vc

You still can do it.
The only invoncenience is that you will have to set executable target
of your choice in
Project > Properties > Debugging > Command
Project > Properties > Debugging > Command Arguments
i.e. gdalinfo


Alternatively, join Dmitry & Maxim efforts to bring CMake into GDAL

Subject: [gdal-dev] Seeking assistance with an OGR2OGR => SQL Server (esri
	geodatabase) Issue
Message-ID: <CAO93NG0anCinZM0m4vsUEQe1QpZcQg4h_wxv86dPVL4FsjKG8A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi there,

The Issue:
I am trying to use ogr2ogr to put a shapefile into a SQL Server table that
is also an esri geodatabase.  I have done this successfully before in the
past with SQL Server 2012 and esri 10.2, running from C#.

I am now attempting to do it with SQL Server 2014 and esri 10.2.2, running
from Python, and am running into a confounding and frustrating issue.  If I
run the following command on a regular SQL database, it works just fine:

'ogr2ogr -f "MSSQLSpatial"
"MSSQL:server=server;database=database;trusted_connection=yes;"
"C:/Users/username/Desktop/Test_Shapefile.shp" -lco "SRID=4326" -lco
"GEOM_TYPE=GEOMETRY" -lco "SCHEMA=DBO" -lco "OVERWRITE=YES" -nln
"TEST_TABLE" -overwrite'

If I point it to an esri geodatabase, however, I get this error:

ERROR 1: Error initializing the metadata tables : [Microsoft][ODBC SQL
Server Driver][SQL Server]There is already an object named
'geometry_columns' in the database.
ERROR 1: Error initializing the metadata tables : [Microsoft][ODBC SQL
Server Driver][SQL Server]There is already an object named
'geometry_columns' in the database.
ERROR 1: Terminating translation prematurely after failed
translation of layer Test_Shapefile (use -skipfailures to skip errors)

Interestingly, if I make an ogrinfo connection to the same database, I get:

ERROR 1: Error initializing the metadata tables : [Microsoft][ODBC SQL
Server Driver][SQL Server]There is already an object named
'geometry_columns' in the database.

INFO: Open of `MSSQL:server=MAPLION-PC;database=GIS;trusted_connection=yes;'
      using driver `MSSQLSpatial' successful.

followed by a listing of my tables in the database.  This happens for every
SDE/geodatabase-enabled database I have tried it on.

Does anyone have any ideas what may be causing this issue?  Thank you.

-Ryan

Hi,

When ever anyone mentions ISO metadata I think of:

ISO 19103
ISO 19115

Are we talking about these?

If we are then I would just like to mention that both of these standards
lose information and context when you attempt to populate the fields from
actual data products.

There is also the issue of interpretation as to what data fields to copy to
which metadata fields.

Because of this I would suggest that each data format should store it's
metadata in a lossless form.

An xlst should be provided to convert each data-format metadata to the
appropriate ISO metadata format.

Regards
Damian

PS. Metadata for data does not excite me, but it is a necessary evil that
is becoming very important.

Hi Kurt,

I'm interested in this topic, so I'd like to pull some more details to
better
understand the idea, if you don't mind.


Kurt Schwehr-2 wrote

Could you elaborate more on what properties exactly are missing
from the current autotest suite?
IOW, what kind of gap autotest2 fills.

Yes, autotest is not a unit testing suite.
To me, it combines functional/integration/blackbox/system/regression
testing.


Kurt Schwehr-2 wrote

Since you mention unittest, then gmock too?


Kurt Schwehr-2 wrote

Isolation at what level?
I suppose, you mean test case isolation, but not isolation of code/unit
under test.

So, the former means each test case runs in isolated environment,
with exclusive access to files/databases/memory/resources required by
particular test.
For example, each run of ogr_mysql.py, also in parallel, exclusively targets
a 'unique' database.

Correct?

AFAIS, architecture of tests won't change much, typically, test cases will
target functional modules (drivers).
Or, do you plan for proper unit tests targeting individual
interfaces/classes
in internal implementation of drivers, etc.?


Kurt Schwehr-2 wrote
> I'm (mostly) following Google's style guides.

Unless it is not planned to include autotest2 into GDAL source code,
shouldn't it follow GDAL style?


Kurt Schwehr-2 wrote

IMHO, those belong to separate suites.


- Test the C API at the C level
</qoute>

If plain unittests are planned, mocking might be possible.

Best regards,
Mateusz

Metadata only excites me when I get someone else's data and I need to know
how it was created.  At which point it has my full attention :-)

I have enabled the "jump to warning|error" from the Visual Studio IDE,
Output|Error List window
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/31019

Should be more covenient.

Just a quick note to say that I reviewed the RFC and like the idea.

I can see this being used someday by the MapInfo TAB/MIF drivers to 
carry the native MapInfo styling info, as well as geometry in some cases 
(rectangle, roundedrect, text object, etc.) to maintain them between TAB 
and MIF files as this conversion can be lossy at the moment.

I also saw a suggestion that it should be possible to disable loading 
the native data when we open a layer and I think that's important if we 
intend to use this for more than just GeoJSON. For instance, when 
loading layers in an application (QGIS, MapServer, etc.) that ignores 
the native data, then it should be possible to have this overhead disabled.

We definitely need a generic option for enabling/disabling this and not 
a driver-specific option. Perhaps the native data should be disabled by 
default for all drivers, and be explicitly turned on by ogr2ogr and by 
apps that know how to use the native info?

No other comments on my part.

Hi,

I noticed Kurt has been applying lots of non-functional code improvements,
refactoring, and cleaning compilation warnings, etc.

I have been considering similar clean-up also to unify class member names
which often lead to compilation warnings due to declaration hiding.

I committed a short example of such refactoring:
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/31023

Would that be something acceptable across the whole source code?

>From my experience, cleaning up such trivias sometimes reveals very
subtle bugs, so it has potential to improve functional quality as well.

I'm willing to join Kurt's efforts.

Best regards,

Hi Hermann,

re'adding the list in CC.

Your point is valid. My idea was to avoid making WKT returned by the modified 
version potentially longer than it is currently

This should perhaps be configurable to accomodate for different use cases.

I guess Kurt will point to
https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html#Variable_Names
with the blabla_ convention ;-)

This underscore suffix convention is used in very few places, mainly the (old) KML driver AFAIK

The m_ convention is used a bit more often in the GDAL code base.

If we adopt any convention, this should be added to https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc8_devguide

Personnaly I find the m_ convention more readable as the trailing underscore
is easy to miss, but perhaps that is the intention ?

Whatever convention would be used, I'd advise not to apply it to public or
protected members of GDAL exported classes (like the ones of gcore/gdal_priv.h),
because that could break external plugins. Or that would require more advertizing of the change.

Some coordination might be required to avoid stepping on each other toes.

I'm not proposing any changes to naming convention. AFAICT, currently GDAL
either uses m_ prefix or nothing.
I will keep using g the m_ prefix, so the trailing underscore is out of
discussion from my point.

> If we adopt any convention, this should be added to

I haven't checked the page but I assume it should be m_

My personal preference is the trailing underscore, but that is irrelevant
as I'm going to follow the code base.

Good point. OK.

Sure. That's why I mentioned Kurt hoping he will chime in.

I am pretty sure you know: '%.17g' could also result into shorter string 
values, compared to the earlier '%.15f', as in the below (admittedly 
unfair) example.

Hermann

$ printf "%.15f\n" 50.375
50.375000000000000
$
$ printf "%.17g\n" 50.375
50.375

Yes, that's intended that the output is potentially now shorter than before. 
Previous formatting outputed too many figures, especially for projected 
coordinates.

Well, I think you'll agree that using m_foo or bla_ is a naming convention, 
and there's nothing specified in  
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/rfc8_devguide related to that.

Right, I meant, to actually apply unified convention: some classes use
no prefix,
others use m_. Let's choose m_ and stick to it.

Then, it's gonna be updated, I think.

I personally like foo_, but m_ is fine.  I worry about unexpected side
effects of changing member naming with private members.  I don't think
there will be any if everything builds, but I still worry.  If we go for
changing publics, we should pick a time and go for a major version number
bump and expect a lot of peopIe using GDAL to go through a lot of pain.  I
see a lot of stuff generally like this...

class Foo
{
public:
  Foo(int blahIn) { this->blah = blahIn; };
  int blah;
}

After looking at a lot of GDAL code, it seems that we should go with:

class Foo
{
  int m_blah;
public:
 Foo( int blah ) : m_blah(blah) {}
 int blah() { return m_blah; }
}

Mateusz,

I'll try to do my best to answer inline.  What we have with autotest is
super important.  I've been trying to figure out how we take the first 17
years of knowledge built up in GDAL and make keep going forward over the
next couple decades.  What will help people contribute to GDAL in the
future?  I started autotest2 with the assumption that the GDAL community
might not be interested in including it in the main GDAL tree, may want to
restructure it and include it, or might only want some pieces.  I'm fine
with any of that.  It's been really helpful for me so far.

Not sure these are the best answers, but here is what I've written off the
top of my head.  I think I'm being a bit redundant.

However, above everything else, we can't give up the coverage that we
currently have.  It's a lot and it's taken a huge effort to get to this
point, but I think it is not nearly enough.  I think that means that
autotest in it's current form will be with us for the foreseeable future.
Nor is it enough to just get the Coverity issue count to 0.

Things that are missing from autotest python code:

- By not being python unittest/unittest2/mock based, a lot of tools don't
know how to discover the tests.  nose <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nose/>,
pytest <http://pytest.org/>, and lots of folks have their own test runners.
 e.g. Google has the internal version of Blaze: Bazel.  I tried writing a
thin unittest wrapper and it turned into a mess.  I'm sure it can be done,
but the env I work in is super constrained.  And the test reporting with
unittest is a lot stronger than what we have with autotest.
- It has a syntax that is unfamiliar to the average python coder.  The
junit style is super common, so there are more folks available who really
know unittest based tools.
- There is a lot of well developed utility in the the unittest/unittest2
infrastructure that is very robust
- Isolated tests.  There are a lot of tests that cascade.  That makes
running tests in parallel much more difficult
- The python mocks library is pretty great for making tests of things like
databases.  We could have standard mocks for database interactions that
would help folks test their python code that uses
gdal+{mysql,postgis,mssql,oracle,etc}.  That could really accelerate
development for many people.
- unittest and other related tools have nice ways to allow running subsets
of tests

Python unittest is often all of the things you describe.  It doesn't do
well with UI and integration testing of super different libraries, but it
is just as capable as what is currently in autotest.

It's worth taking a look at some examples.  e.g. Fiona's tests
<https://github.com/Toblerity/Fiona/tree/master/tests>

Both types of isolation would be nice.  GDAL isn't designed for isolated
component testing of the drivers.  I've mostly been able to do isolated
testing on ports/cpl_*.  The biggest isolation issue is between each test
function/method.  Using the same filenames or using global variables and
having one test create a file and then follow on tests use that file.  Some
of these show up like this:

cd autotest
egrep 'gdaltest.[a-z]+_ds =' */*.py | grep -v None | head
gdrivers/fast.py:    gdaltest.fast_ds = gdal.Open(
'data/L71118038_03820020111_HPN.FST' )
gdrivers/georaster.py:    gdaltest.oci_ds = ogr.Open(
os.environ.get('OCI_DSNAME') )
gdrivers/mem.py:    gdaltest.mem_ds = drv.Create( 'mem_1.mem', 50, 3 )
gdrivers/pcidsk.py:    gdaltest.pcidsk_ds = driver.Create(
'tmp/pcidsk_5.pix', 400, 600, 1,
gdrivers/pcidsk.py:    gdaltest.pcidsk_ds = gdal.Open( 'tmp/pcidsk_5.pix',
gdal.GA_Update )
gdrivers/pcidsk.py:    gdaltest.pcidsk_ds = gdal.Open( 'tmp/pcidsk_5.pix',
gdal.GA_Update )
gdrivers/pcidsk.py:    gdaltest.pcidsk_ds = gdal.Open( 'tmp/pcidsk_5.pix',
gdal.GA_Update )

'tmp/rawlink.vrt', gdal.GA_Update )
gdrivers/vrtrawlink.py:    gdaltest.rawlink_ds = gdal.Open(
'tmp/rawlink.vrt', gdal.GA_Update )
gdrivers/vrtwarp.py:    gdaltest.vrtwarp_ds = gdal.AutoCreateWarpedVRT(
gcp_ds )

egrep 'gdaltest.[a-z]+_ds =' */*.py | grep -v None | tail
ogr/ogr_sqlite.py:    gdaltest.sl_ds = ogr.Open( 'tmp/sqlite_test.db',
update = 1  )
ogr/ogr_sqlite.py:    gdaltest.sl_ds = ogr.Open( 'tmp/sqlite_test.db'  )
ogr/ogr_sqlite.py:    gdaltest.sl_ds = ogr.Open( 'tmp/sqlite_test.db',
update = 1  )
ogr/ogr_sqlite.py:    gdaltest.sl_ds = ogr.Open( 'tmp/sqlite_test.db',

)

Looking at drivers, I think the level and type of testing that is
appropriate varies quite a bit.  Some drivers are super simple and some are
very complex.  In general, extensive testing of internals isn't super
important.  What we do need a ton more of is testing the failure paths.
 e.g. I took AFL and ran it against ogr2ogr and a custom little loader
program to read geojson.  GDAL code should never crash or hang, but it most
definitely does.  We need to turn those input files into test cases.

We also can use AFL to generate test cases that cover more of the failure
modes.   I did that with minixml:  r30854
<https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/changeset/30854/>

Not necessarily.   I'm working for Google and starting from scratch with
Google engineers doing the reviews, so I'm using the Google Style Guides.
The style for GDAL isn't what users of the library are likely to do.  A
part of what I'm trying to do with autotest2 is also give examples of what
I think are good ways to use GDAL.  People are likely going to use C++11/14
and Hungarian-ish notation is not something I've seen in any other project
I've worked on.  The Google style guide is pretty well flushed out, where
as RFC 8 for GDAL is very minimalistic.  I prefer to work in a space where
I can just follow.

Why separate the memory and thread tests?  If you write really solid
unittests in C++, you can flip on or off those modes.  As long as your
unittests properly cleanup, then they are great code to use for
ASAN/MSAN/etc.  For fuzzing, it is definitely helpful to isolate things
like the geojson driver from all the mechanics of which driver to use.
We'd like to be able to pass anything to the driver directly to trigger
code paths.  For performance, it really is a challenge and likely going to
be challenging to figure out what is worth doing.

Subject: [gdal-dev] gdal_polygonize.py not running
Message-ID: <018601d108b8$f1a98b40$d4fca1c0$@com>

Hi,

 

I am using the GISInternals release-1800-x64-gdal-1-11-1-mapserver-6-4-1
and I run the SDKShell.bat.

Then I tried running the gdal_polygonize.py as is and I got the following
message:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

C:\GEC\Software\GDAL\gisinternals>gdal_polygonize.py

"gdal_polygonize.py" non è riconosciuto come comando interno o esterno,

 un programma eseguibile o un file batch.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

In Italian, that means command not recognized so I thought the SDKShell is
not setting the path for this script.

 

I tried then running the command from the script folder as follow, but got
several errors:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

C:\GEC\Software\GDAL\gisinternals\bin\gdal\python\scripts>gdal_polygonize.py

    return load_dynamic(name, filename, file)

ImportError: DLL load failed: Impossibile trovare il modulo specificato.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------

 

 

To me it looks like the script is not able to load other external files
(gdal, ogr, osr
), so I still think it is a matter of PATH setting.

 

Any help is very much appreciated.

Public members should stay as they are, not renamed.
That is also Even's suggestion.

There can be subtle effects indeed, so care should be taken.

Consider the following example (just for the fun) :

#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>  /* const char *index(const char *s, int c); */

class foo
{
        typedef const char* (*ptrfnc)(const char*, int);
        ptrfnc index;

    public:

        foo() : index(0) {}

        ptrfnc getIndex()
        {
            return index;
        }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("%p\n", foo().getIndex());
    return 0;
}

==> Displays (nil)

Now let's rename index to m_index, but forget to change getIndex():

#include <stdio.h>
#include <strings.h>  /* const char *index(const char *s, int c); */

class foo
{
        typedef const char* (*ptrfnc)(const char*, int);
        ptrfnc m_index;

    public:

        foo() : m_index(0) {}

        ptrfnc getIndex()
        {
            return index;
        }
};

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    printf("%p\n", foo().getIndex());
    return 0;
}

This still compiles without warning but displays 0x400548 ...

I'm not going to argue if it si common or a bit convoluted case
with limtied scope, it is a good example.

To avoid introducing new bugs, I suggest to use refactoring tools offered by
any modern IDE. VS2015 handles your case flawlessly. I'd expect the same
from Qt Creator or Clion and others.

Potential of such problems is a good reason to use namespaces,
include common C98/C++ headers via C++ equivalents , #include <c*>,
i.e. <cstring>,
and import C stuff via std namespace. Then, such bugs are caught by compiler.

<strings.h> is part of POSIX, means it delivers C definitions,
so there is no std namespace there, but majority of GDAL is C++.

I'm not sure if such clean up is also on Kurt's list, but again, I can help.

I assume, you mean to identify and remove objective barriers at levels of

Right.
I think it is important to clarify the term coverage here.
It is meant in terms of coverity, static analysis, but not necessarily as
code coverage vs our test suite. I hope I get it right myself too.

I agree, it is a barrier for potential contributions who know Python
native testing package(s).
Since the autotest package is a complex piece of software, but not based on
standard Python tools, it does not allow knowledge transfer/re-use.

I second that.

I wasn't aware of cascading requirement or inter-dependencies in current tests.
It would be good to solve such issues, indeed.

I second that too.
So, you are considering to use fakes for infrastructure.
Apart from simplifying testing environment, speeding things up,
it would also enable development of proper unit tests.

Yes. I'm huge fan of nose and its tests tagging feature.

I have and I do.

I'd add couple of points to your list:
- test single thing per test method, it means one assertion per test method
- make test methods 5 lines long max
- use long descriptive names for test methods, not Python comments!
(ogr_csv_5 and alike is not a good name)

(Note, I don't say test case, as test case is a class in unittest, so better
speak of test methods.)

Added value is that such tests become great set of examples and tutorials.

You're right.

Yes, CPL should be nice for unit testing with fakes.

Yes, that is an issue indeed.

I see.
I doubt it is practical to try to mock anything in drivers.
The gmock could be used to test some gcore interfaces though.

Ok, I understand.

I can also imagine, Python users may expect Pythonic way of
writing Python tests for GDAL.

It is hard to disagree.

Right. Even if autotest2 makes it into GDAL codebase, it would be developed as
separate module, so not following GDAL style legacy shouldn't be an issue.
On the contrary, it could promote some more C++11/14 idiomatic code leaks into
GDAL core base...while GDAL is gradually dropping support for
non-C++11/14-compliant compilers :P

I meant, separate from unit or integration testing.

My point was this:
You don't write unit or integration tests with performance as a goal.
Technically, you can, but that imposes too many goals for your unit tests -
while a good  unit test should tests single thing, assert single aspect, without
killing too may ducks with one shot.

Chances are, we understand the term "unit test" differently.

C API is a public interface easily accessible.
You can unit test single C API function (or aspect of it)
by mocking related/dependency calls (i.e. https://cmocka.org).


I like your ideas and approach which are aligned with my own "wishes"
I've had collected about GDAL tests.
Once you properly public with your project, I may be able to help.

I came across this article recently. Is this available as a resampling kernel in GDAL? It looks very interesting. 

We have been processing landscape height GeoTIFFs with GDAL and in recent projects we found anything beyond the ‘bilinear’ mode in GDAL had a tendency to introduce problematic artefacts. (With height data, 2D visual artefacts effectively become small artificial landscape structures that can interfere with modelling of e.g. slopes, soil erosion, contours, terrain driving costs).

Hello Graeme,

I agree that looks interesting - it would be good to see the results of 
some empirical tests on height data.  I have had similar problems to you 
with some resampling algorithms 
(https://github.com/geo-data/cesium-terrain-builder/issues/4): 'average' 
seemed to produce good results with height data for our use case.

Best regards,

Homme.

Unfortunately I do not understand the mathematics of the {1/4, 3/4, 3/4,
1/4} kernel but if there is a way to turn this "magic" kernel into odd
kernel (odd as an opposite to even) you can use GDAL VRT.
http://cbloomrants.blogspot.fi/2011/03/03-24-11-image-filters-and-gradients.html
perhaps suggests that it is possible. GDAL KernelFilteredSource accepts only
odd filters.

I copy here an example about how to make GDAL to support the 5x5 unsharp
kernel https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_%28image_processing%29 

</VRTRasterBand>
  <VRTRasterBand dataType="Byte" band="2">
    <ColorInterp>Green</ColorInterp>
    <KernelFilteredSource>
      <SourceFilename relativeToVRT="1">unsharp_filter_test.tif</SourceFilename>
      <SourceBand>2</SourceBand>
        <Kernel normalized="1">
          <Size>5</Size>
          <Coefs>1 4 6 4 1 4 16 24 16 4 6 24 -476 24 6 4 16 24 16 4 1 4 6 4
1</Coefs>
        </Kernel>
    </KernelFilteredSource>
</VRTRasterBand>

VRT works fine in QGIS and I can't notice any speed difference with
unfiltered image.

Subject: [gdal-dev] CS transformations
Message-ID: <1445280072.3726.19.camel@charon>


I am a newbie at osgeo and gdal and have done the obligatory googling
and reading of tutorials and documentation. I have made it pretty far
before I found my way here so thanks to everyone for all of the good
documentation and references online already.

language: Python 3.4
OS: Ubuntu 14.04 (up to date)

Task:
Read in various georef PDF files, make a bounding box of the valid data
in the pixel or image coordinate system (CS) and WGS84. The data
somewhat mimics the USGS in that there is a metadata item called
NEATLINE that describes the valid data polygon. So, I thought I would
use a USGS historical quad to build up my software decoding of the maps.
I made it this far...

# read the PDF
ds = gdal.Open('Madulce_Peak_O34119F5_geo.pdf')

# get the affine to transform to pixel CS
at = ds.GetGeoTransform()

# get the dataset projection and wrap it with spatial reference
source = osgeo.osr.SpatialReference()
source.SetProjection (ds.GetProjection())

# build the spatial reference for WGS84
target = osgeo.osr.SpatialReference()
target.SetWellKnownGeogCS('WGS84')

# make the transform to go between the CS
transform = osgeo.osr.CoordinateTransformation(source, target)

# take the first point of the map's NEATLINE and transform
p = osgeo.ogr.CreateGeometryFromWkt ('POINT (34277.755142044210515
-376750.367268434783909')
p.Transform (transform)

   4622 
   4623     def GetSpatialReference(self, *args):

TypeError: in method 'Geometry_Transform', argument 2 of type
'OSRCoordinateTransformationShadow *'

I cannot find anything to help me out at this point -- I am probably not
searching for the right keywords more than anything. Did I mess up the
transform? Did I mess up defining the source projection? I figure these
are the two most likely problems that I have, but I am all ears for any
other problems.

I am worried that all of the suggestions will be to use warp or
transform at the command line, but for complicated reasons using those
tools is undesirable. It is more important that I learn how to do such a
seemingly obvious task in the Python environment.

--> This is not the right method to call. SetProjection(string) is for 
projection names like 'Transverse_Mercator', etc... but not full WKT 
definitions

You want to use instead source.ImportFromWkt(ds.GetProjection())

I agree about the need for the feature, and I think it is a useful addition, but I'll admit to being a bit concerned about the "native" nomenclature.  It allows us to incrementally add capability for stuff like GeoJSON extensions without having to disrupt the entire API to support it. 

Because every OGR Feature implementation potentially has a native representation, this API addition brings up some questions:

1) Would it be an ideal that every OGR feature carry around a blob of its native representation to answer this API? 
2) "Native" sounds faster or better in some unspecified qualitative way, and this name might cause people to go peeking into rabbit holes of the API that they might best stay out of.  
3) Is there to be an ODCNative capability test for drivers?

Not all formats have necessary a more expressive "native" representation than 
the one given by their OGRFeature. And this only makes sense when doing 
conversions between the same format.

I'm very well open to suggestions for a better naming... from English native 
speakers ;-) Sean initially proposed the note/annotation terminology.
Your concerns can also perhaps be addressed by adding to the documentation of 
the related methods that this isn't intended for general use and only to gain 
access to details that cannot be expressed otherwise through the rest of the 
API ?

> 3) Is there to be an ODCNative capability test for drivers?

As Daniel suggested, maybe we need to be able to enable on purpose that 
capability as an open option. So the open option list could have a 
NATIVE_REPRESENTATION=YES/NO toggle (default NO). And perhaps have also a 
GDAL_DCAP_NATIVE_VECTOR metadata item at the driver level.

Subject: [gdal-dev] OGR error handling
Message-ID: <5626941A.8030104@caris.com>

Hi all,

We are using OGRSFDriver::CopyDataSource() to copy a GML data source to a memory data source on v1.11.x.

We have encountered a problem where one of the feature tags of a particular GML file we are trying to read is malformed. What we are seeing is that an error occurs in OGRGMLLayer::GetNextFeature(), which gets reported as expected via CPLError().

The problem we are faced with is that that error seems to be reset using CPLErrorReset() before control returns to the caller of CopyDataSource(), specifically in OGRDataSource::CopyLayer(). The result is that the copying silently skips over problematic features.


Is that the expected behavior of copying a data source? Given that GDAL isn't necessarily exception safe, we've typically used CPLGetLastErrorNo after control returns to get at such errors that occur in functions that do not return an error directly in the method signature. Is there a better approach to error handling that we could/should be using?

Thanks,
André

I'm not clear of the reason for those CPLErrorReset() in CopyLayer(). I guess 
you could remove them without trouble.

If you don't want to modify GDAL sources, a workaround would be to install 
your own error handler with CPLSetErrorHandler() or CPLPushErrorHandler() so 
as to note the error.

If CPLError gets called then the issue is reported and it is not 
silently skipped. I believe the driver writer has judged the issue not 
an error but only worth of a warning, thus the GetNextFeature does not 
return a NULL, which would lead to immediate return without error reset.

As Even wrote I guess you should make your code to keep an eye on 
warnings and not accept the copy if there are any you deem too serious.

Message-ID: <CAOL+ROGosYFsXPYj9=v2ym4uGOdGXGTEv2uhv4JHBbwP3bHKKg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I've been trying unsuccessfully to extract a feature class from a large
file geodatabase.  While many of the other feature classes in it are read
properly, on this one I get the following error:

$ ogrinfo -summary file.gdb Streets
Had to open data source read-only.
INFO: Open of `file.gdb'
      using driver `OpenFileGDB' successful.

Layer name: Streets
Geometry: Multi Line String
ERROR 1: Error occured in filegdbtable.cpp at line 768

Line 768 is part of this block of code:

     if( byFieldType > FGFT_XML)
        {
            CPLDebug("OpenFileGDB", "Unhandled field type : %d",
byFieldType);
            returnError();   <---- line 768
        }

Can any of you provide me some suggestions for how I can trace the specific
cause of this problem more precisely?  Unfortunately, this is commercial
data which I can't share with you, but I'd be happy to try to diagnose the
problem more thoroughly.

Thanks,

Roger

I like the format-native data concept, but agree that there's some
potential for confusion. For GeoJSON, the native data could also be
accurately called "extension data". How about that?

Subject: [gdal-dev] encoding in custom python functions
Message-ID: <CAKWoFMLd-OcuEnooZj7S0_kT1ty87Fpso2RJ=Xxwp3pOn=X6dw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm trying to figure out some encoding problems when using custom python
expression functions.

I'm using python functions for defining some label texts. I need use some
special characters like ä and ö.

When a new file is created in function editor the file is encoded in my
system encoding cp1252. At least the ä is coded to 0xe4 if I check that
with hex-editor.
Let the custom function just be
@qgsfunction(args='auto', group='Custom')
def encodingtest(feature, parent):
return 'ä'

This displays on a map like 'Ã¤'
It seems that the file is converted to utf-8 before execution and the ä is
then coded to 0xc3 0xa4. Now QGIS still tries to interpret this as cp1252
and then displays this as 'Ã¤'.

It doesn't help to define the ä as unicode like u'ä' because QGIS still
sees the ä as 0xc3 0xa4 and think that it is in cp1252.

The only way to resolve this in the code at least that I have found is to
use
return 'ä'.decode('utf-8')
This works on QGIS but the file can't be executed elsewhere (IDE) since the
file is truly in cp1252 and 0xe4 can't be decoded using utf-8.


Does anyone else confirm this and have I understood right the problem?
Should I file a bug report?


Thanks,

-Lauri

Message-ID: <1080621905.1573597.1445501673977.JavaMail.yahoo@mail.yahoo.com>

Dear list members,I would like you to help me with two issues I have while trying to set/get the attributes of the JP2OpenJPEG driver through the GDAL API in Python:
1) When I run the commands:Raster = gdal.Open(tiffile)jpg_driver = gdal.GetDriverByName('JP2OpenJPEG')
jpg_driver.Register()jpg_file = jpg_driver.CreateCopy(outjp2file, Raster, options = ['QUALITY=100', 'REVERSIBLE=YES'])
the attributes are set without problem (tiffile refers to a Geotiff image and outjp2file is the name of the new jp2 file); when I try to retrieve them the only thing I manage to do is to read the main keys:Raster = gdal.Open(outjp2file)
driver = Raster.GetDriver()
metadata = driver.GetMetadata()metadata{'DMD_EXTENSION': 'jp2', 'DMD_CREATIONOPTIONLIST': "<CreationOptionList>   <Option name='CODEC' type='string-select' default='according to file extension.

print driver.GetMetadataItem('DMD_CREATIONOPTIONLIST')<CreationOptionList>   <Option name='CODEC' type='string-select' default='according to file extension. If unknown, default to J2K'>  ......

How can I retrieve the attributes 'QUALITY' and 'REVERSIBLE'?

2) If instead of using the command:jpg_file = jpg_driver.CreateCopy(outjp2file, Raster, options = ['QUALITY=100', 'REVERSIBLE=YES'])

I use the following:jpg_driver.SetMetadataItem('QUALITY','100','IMAGE_STRUCTURE')jpg_driver.SetMetadataItem('REVERSIBLE','YES','IMAGE_STRUCTURE')jpg_driver.Register()jpg_file = jpg_driver.CreateCopy(outjp2file, Raster)

why these two attributes are set as primary keys and not in the options list?
Thank you in advance.Basos

You get driver metadata here, that is to say the capabilities of the driver, 
not the charactersitics of a particular dataset.

> print driver.GetMetadataItem('QUALITY')None
> print driver.GetMetadataItem('QUALITY', 'IMAGE_STRUCTURE')None

If they were available as metadata (but they are not), that should be queried 
on the dataset, not the driver.

> 
> How can I retrieve the attributes 'QUALITY' and 'REVERSIBLE'?

You can't. At least not that easily. They aren't exposed as metadata when 
reading a dataset.
You can have a look at the dump_jp2 utility mentionned in 
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/UserDocs/JPEG2000Utils to get the 
reversive/reversible parameter, but I don't think it is possibly to recover 
quality (might be, but I'm not knowleadgable enough)

No, that will not have the effect you want. Setting metadata on drivers is 
without effect. Using creation options like you did initially is the right way 
to do it.

Hi,
i have this same issue but  "in order to deploy ArcSDE technology as an

Since that geotools has  " ArcSDE plugin allows the GeoTools developer to

wounder if it is possible to use this plugin to build a OGR SDE Driver?

Any suggestion or opinion about this issue would be great.

Thanks in advance.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Follow on to the "ISO Metadata" post
Message-ID: <FAAF6EDEF3754BA091ED8F4BDA4F7781@TimCrookLaptop>

Hello Doug and Damian.

I saw your post about ISO 19103, ISO 19115 and  ISO 19115-1. I am starting 
to look at ticket #3549 (https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3549). This 
ticket is a specific problem for metadata translation for image 
transformations to the PCIDSK format. The ticket references JPEG and TIFF.

The first thing I thought of was when I saw your posts was mapping the XML 
metadata from different sources into an internal format to GDAL, then 
passing through the information for mapping to the destination format. I 
suppose there are some image source formats that don't use XML to store 
their metadata, so this would require additional handling.

I suppose the internal format to GDAL could be XML in the ISO 19115-1 
format.

Am I completely off base here?

Are you asking if using geotools could somehow avoid the need for arcsde 
client libraries? If so, no.

Reasons:
 - Geotools uses the arcsde SDK (just via Java)
 - Even if that wasn't the case, calling java (geotools) from C/C++ (gdal) 
would be fairly difficult and not very portable.

Why would you need ArcSDE support if you don't have an ESRI server license? If 
you have the server license, you should be able to download the client side 
libraries to match.

Hi,

I am reading the ElasticSearch manual page
http://www.gdal.org/drv_elasticsearch.html and I wonder what does this mean
for an end user of ogrinfo and ogr2ogr

"If specifying "ES" as the dialect of ExecuteSQL(), a JSon string with a
serialized Elastic Search filter can be passed"

Are ogrinfo and ogr2ogr analyzing automatically without any user input what
is coming after "-where" or "-sql" and if it is json then it will be passed on?

Should ElasticSearch be included in the Non-OGR SQL section of
http://www.gdal.org/ogr_sql.html?

I think you should be able to solve it this way:

1) For PostgreSQL/PostGIS do not set GDAL_DATA as environment variable
but as postgresql.gdal_datapath option
Read here http://postgis.net/docs/manual-dev/postgis_gdal_datapath.html

2) Set GDAL_DATA env var for GDAL 2.0.1 apps

If postgresql.gdal_datapath is defined, PostGIS should prefer it.
without trying GDAL_DATA env variable.

I have learned that users should know about the existence of the ES SQL
dialect if they want to use ES filters inside GDAL VRT data source. This VTR
works fine for me, notice the use of <SrcSQL dialect="ES">

<OGRVRTDataSource>
    <OGRVRTLayer name="ES_with_filter">
        <SrcDataSource>ES:http://localhost:9200 allcountries</SrcDataSource>
        <SrcSQL dialect="ES">
        {
    "query": {
        "geo_shape": {
            "geometry": {
                "shape": {
                    "type": "envelope",
                    "coordinates": [[14, 52],[14.1, 52.2]]
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</SrcSQL>
    </OGRVRTLayer>
</OGRVRTDataSource>

For -sql, you need to specify -dialect ES
For -where, there's no way in the API for specifying a dialect. So the driver 
sees if { is the first character, in which case it infers this is JSon filter.

Perhaps, although that when dealing with the particulars of each driver, the 
better reference is the doc page of the driver. This is kind of a hack of 
passing ES JSon filters in an interface called ExecuteSQL, so advertizing it in 
a generic page might bring more confusion to the general public.
I let the doc team do what they think is appropriate ;-)

Helmut,

Looking at the ECW driver code, if the .ecw file itself has an internal 
georeferencing, then the world file .eww is ignored, which looks consistent 
with the above report. This is a debatable behaviour. I think this has been 
discussed quite a few times. Maybe a config option to override the behaviour 
would be useful.

A potential workaround is to edit 6617-04.ecw.aux.xml with the following 
content derived from the .eww.
.aux.xml overrides the internal georeferencing of the .ecw.

  <GeoTransform>653750,0.2,0,440720,0,-0.2</GeoTransform>

.aux.xml overriding seems to work. the raster are now correctly displayed in
QGIS etc.

a config option to override would be helpful.

thanks.

--> This is not the more accurate translation from worldfile convention to GDAL 
convention. The coordinates of the top-left pixel in worldfiles are the center 
of pixel. In GDAL convention, it is the top-left corner of the top-left pixel, 
hence a half-pixel shift. So in GDAL, the GeoTransform should be:

<GeoTransform>653750,0.2,0,170000,0,-0.2</GeoTransform>

thanks again for the hint about the center/top-left pixel issue.

Hello,

 

I am very excited about the Delaunay Triangulation and linear gridding code
that is on the SVN trunk for GDAL, and wondering when that might make it
into a released version.  Is that slated for inclusion in 2.1?  Is there an
estimated release timeline for 2.1?  Is there anything I can do to help with
that code?

 

Thanks!

Subject: [gdal-dev] Problem with using ogr2ogr to migrate data from Postgis
 to TSQL/Oracle Spatial
Message-ID: <1445762801775-5232425.post@n6.nabble.com>

Hello guys,

I'm learning about ogr2ogr and have encountered a problem.

So I have some data isnide my postgis database that Im trying to migrate to
the tsql and oracle spatial databases.

My postgres config:
###################################################
create sequence my_geometry_table_id_SEQ;
CREATE TABLE public.my_geometry_table
(
  id integer NOT NULL DEFAULT nextval('my_geometry_table_id_SEQ'::regclass),
  date_modified timestamp with time zone,
  geom geometry(Polygon,3765),
  CONSTRAINT my_geometry_table_id PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

insert into public.my_geometry_table(id, date_modified, geom)
values(nextval('my_geometry_table_id_SEQ'),'2013-02-11 09:43:00+01',
ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((30 10, 40 40, 20 40, 10 20, 30 10))', 3765));
###################################################


ogr2ogr script Im using:
###################################################
ogr2ogr --debug -overwrite -s_srs EPSG:3765 -t_srs EPSG:3765-f 
"MSSQLSpatial"  MSSQL:server=xy;database=xy;uid=xy;pwd=xy "PG:host=xy
user=xy dbname=xy password=xy port=5432" -lco PRECISION=NO -nlt POLYGON -nln
my_geometry_table -sql "select * from public.my_geometry_table"
###################################################


Error when sending to ORACLE SPATIAL:
###################################################
ERROR 1: ORA-01830: date format picture ends before converting entire input
string
 in OCIStmtExecute
###################################################

 
Error when sending to TSQL:
###################################################
ERROR: Cannot convert varchar to datetime. Conversion failed when converting
date and/or time from character string.
###################################################

When I remove the timezone column from the POSTGIS source, or convert the
column type to varchar via ogr the data gets transfered. 

So it seems that the ogr2ogr cannot handle postgres timezone info from a
timestamp column. Is there a known workaround around this, or must I use
python bindings to trim the timezone portion for each row?

I don't want to convert the column to varchar.

Used versions:
oracle spatial: 11g
tsql: 11.0
postgis: POSTGIS="2.1.7 r13414" 
ogr2ogr version: using 2.0.1, tried with 1.11, 1.13

Thanks.

Have you tried typecasting your "timestamp with time zone" to a 
"timestamp witout time zone" as a workaround ?

*ogr2ogr ... -sql "select id, date_modified::timestamp, geom from 
public.my_geometry_table" ...*

Hi,

I wonder if this gis.stackexchange question
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/167584/clipping-vs-intersecting could
indicate that GDAL is doing clipping in a sub-optimal way, perhaps without
utilizing spatial index or something like that. ArcGIS and OpenJUMP are
claimed to clip linestrings 100 times faster than GDAL.

Yes, it doesn't use spatial index if you don't specify one explictly with -
spat. Was discussed recently I believe.
Could/should be improved. Patch welcome if someone wants to have a try.

And probably with -spat the spatial index is only used for discarding features which are outside the area of interest but not for analyzing if they are candidates for clipping or not. With complicated features it might be good to compare first if the boundary of clipping polygon crosses the bbox of a feature - no cross - for sure no need to clip.

Subject: [gdal-dev] Transactional GDAL WFS client
Message-ID: <562DD2FB.5050704@gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm developing a WFS server in Perl based on GDAL (i.e., GDAL is 
generating the GML the server sends to the client) and I'm testing it 
using the GDAL WFS client.

I'm obviously ignorant on some basic issues since I'm getting an error

"Cannot insert feature because we didn't manage to parse the .XSD schema"

which comes from WFSLayer::ICreateFeature.

The test code is very simple:

my $ds = Geo::OGR::DataSource::Open('WFS:http://localhost/TestApp', 1);
my $layer = $ds->GetLayer('local.mittauskohteet2.geom');
my $feature = Geo::OGR::Feature->new($layer->Schema);
$feature->Geometry(Geo::OGR::Geometry->new(WKT=>'POINT (1 2)'));
$feature->Field('koodi' => 'fake');
$layer->CreateFeature($f);

What am I missing?

Best regards,

Ari

Sorted this out myself.

The problem was the "type" property of "element"  elements in 
DescribeFeatureType. It was not recognized by GDAL. GDAL makes them ok, 
but for PostgreSQL data sources I'm using Perl database tools and 
obviously need to pay a bit more attention to setting the type.

Hi all,

For the head of svn trunk....

Anyone have use cases that only work with the old PCIDSK driver?  If so,
let me know and I'll see if I can add some documentation.  Otherwise, I
propose removing the old driver and the autoconf/make tests and
conditionals that support it.

Personally I would not use ISO 19115-1 as an internal format.

There are not a huge number of data formats/products that store metadata as
XML out of the box. When they do store metadata it is usually specific to
the data and data product (regardless of how the metadata is stored).

There have been attempts at adding metadata alongside data products such as
UK MOD profile of IS0 19115 (MOD profile has problems). The French
equivalent of the MOD have for a number of years mandated a metadata format
alongside all data products used by them (wish I could find the actual
standard for the metadata).

The biggest problem is actually mapping from data/'data product' metadata
to the target metadata specification.

Just to highlight how much a problem the mapping of fields from one
metadata format to another is; we have been arguing off and on for more
than a year internally about the meaning of dates and which date should be
in which field. Two of our big customers do not agree on the meaning of
some of the source data date fields and the mappings we have done.

I believe ESRI have their own internal metadata format that they provide a
tool to translate to other XML metadata specifications.

Where I work I have been pushing a per data/'data product' format that is
XML based that uses tag value pairs. The tags would basically be a dump of
all available information and specific to each data/'data product'. A set
of XSLT scripts would then translate the information to what ever metadata
standard you wanted to use and if you needed to modify the mapping you
could change the XSLT script for that data/'data product'.

We have found that hard-coding the mapping is too costly to maintain and
very difficult to get right.

Probably not the answer you are looking for.

Regards
Damian

Yes, it had occurred to me that XSLT would be a flexible way of handling a lot of the metadata mappings.

  I saw your post about ISO 19103, ISO 19115 and  ISO 19115-1. I am starting to look at ticket #3549 (https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3549). This ticket is a specific problem for metadata translation for image transformations to the PCIDSK format. The ticket references JPEG and TIFF.

  The first thing I thought of was when I saw your posts was mapping the XML metadata from different sources into an internal format to GDAL, then passing through the information for mapping to the destination format. I suppose there are some image source formats that don't use XML to store their metadata, so this would require additional handling.

  I suppose the internal format to GDAL could be XML in the ISO 19115-1 format.

  Am I completely off base here?

When retrieving a sub dataset from GDAL using GDALOpen() and expressing the file path as  "NITF_TOC_ENTRY:CADRG_TLM50_50K_2_18:C:/rpf/a.toc "  there is a considerable delay.  This delay is acceptable if the RFP's coverage is for the United States, but if the coverage is for the world then it becomes a problem.

Is there a different way that I should be working with RPF (CADRG) within the GDAL framework or should I move on to something like OSSIM?

Thanks for any help you can give,

Doug,

you might try defining the RPFTOC_FORCE_RGBA envirnoment variable/config option 
to YES. This should avoid GDALOpen'ing all the tiles at dataset creation. 
However the presence of all tiles will be checked via a 'stat' call, which can 
still be a potential bottleneck. That could probably be disabled with some 
code changes (the code would then assume that all declared tiles are 
effectively present on the disk).

I am close to finished with this driver which was delayed significantly 
getting access to a DB2 for z/OS test environment to verify that it 
works across IBM DB2 platforms.

What is the proper way to handle authorship in the source code? The DB2 
driver is based on the MS SQL driver with significant changes to support 
the DB2 environment. Current prologues have information like:

* * Author:   Tamas Szekeres, szekerest at gmail.com

  * Copyright (c) 2010, Tamas Szekeres
  * Copyright (c) 2010-2012, Even Rouault <even dot rouault at 
mines-paris dot org>*

I've mostly been testing using the apps test_ogrsf, ogr2ogr and ogrinfo.

Is there any documentation on the autotest system? It was interesting to 
find that there was a 2003 DB2 test driver for DB2 V7 - we are now at V10.5.

Regards,
David

Put yourself as author, add yourself (or your company depending on in which 
context you contribute this) in copyright and retain copyright attributions of 
portions of code you derive from. Which can be hard to determine in practice. 
So I'd say retain Tamas ones and you can probably remove mine, which must be 
anectodical in the case of the MSSQL driver.

Well, itself is assumed to be self documented ;-) look at a few existing 
scripts close to what you want to do and do the same...

You mean the ogr/ogr_db2_hack.py file ? I'm not sure if/which was the 
corresponding driver. Perhaps the generic OBDC one.

My thoughts on an XML encapsulation of metadata would be (I'll leave the
exact layout and details to the experts):


<product>

   <name>name of product</name>

   <data>

     <format>vpf/shape etc...</format>

     <item key="k1" value="val1" />

     <item key="k2" value="val2" />

     <item key="kN" value="valN" />

   </data>

</product>


Problems I can see with this:


   - Should the data wrap the product?
   - How do you encapsulate XML metadata?
   - What information should be captured?

*Product*

GDAL/OGR reads data and does not identify product.


A product tends to use a carrier format such as shape, S57, VPF, GML,
etc... If you know what the product is you can derive additional
information that can be very useful in automatic styling or handling of the
data.


*Encapsulating XML metadata*

Some data formats may contain a mixture of binary and XML. Take for example
JPEG which contains both binary information and XML data such as Geo
Spatial information.


I see no point translating native XML metadata to a different XML format.
You risk losing information.


*What information should be captured?*

Some of the information can be derived from the data or the way the data is
stored on the media.


Information that can be derived from the data can be just as important as
the metadata stored in the data.


This in part refers to identifying the product, scale of the data, intended
us, provenance, use restrictions, modification dates, creation dates,
expiry dates, who created the data, etc...


The information may not be in the data itself but alongside the data in
additional files.


Derived metadata should be created at the point that the data is read to
generate the metadata. Sounds odd but consider, metadata is used in the
process of cataloging data so that you can find the data you need for your
GIS application.


*Key/Value pairs*

The keys are unique to the data and potentially to the product.


The aim should be to not lose information that is read from the data.

Thank you for the quick response.

I've not used Python before so I'm stumbling getting the environment to 
work. Python 2.7 is installed and I am running from the autotest 
directory. It isn't obvious to me how the PYTHONPATH variable is 
supposed to be set, but I pointed it to the python directory in the gdal

Yes, I understand this. Namespaces use can go a long way to prevent loss of source information while presenting information in the new target format. It can be verbose, though.

Subject: Re: Follow on to the "ISO Metadata" post 
 

My thoughts on an XML encapsulation of metadata would be (I'll leave the exact layout and details to the experts):

<product>
   <name>name of product</name>
   <data>
     <format>vpf/shape etc...</format>
     <item key="k1" value="val1" />
     <item key="k2" value="val2" />
     <item key="kN" value="valN" />
   </data>
</product>

Problems I can see with this:
Should the data wrap the product?
How do you encapsulate XML metadata?
What information should be captured? 
Product
GDAL/OGR reads data and does not identify product.

A product tends to use a carrier format such as shape, S57, VPF, GML, etc... If you know what the product is you can derive additional information that can be very useful in automatic styling or handling of the data.

Encapsulating XML metadata
Some data formats may contain a mixture of binary and XML. Take for example JPEG which contains both binary information and XML data such as Geo Spatial information.

I see no point translating native XML metadata to a different XML format. You risk losing information.

What information should be captured?
Some of the information can be derived from the data or the way the data is stored on the media.

Information that can be derived from the data can be just as important as the metadata stored in the data.

This in part refers to identifying the product, scale of the data, intended us, provenance, use restrictions, modification dates, creation dates, expiry dates, who created the data, etc...

The information may not be in the data itself but alongside the data in additional files.

Derived metadata should be created at the point that the data is read to generate the metadata. Sounds odd but consider, metadata is used in the process of cataloging data so that you can find the data you need for your GIS application.

Key/Value pairs
The keys are unique to the data and potentially to the product.

The aim should be to not lose information that is read from the data.

Hi Tim,
 
Personally I would not use ISO 19115-1 as an internal format.
 
There are not a huge number of data formats/products that store metadata as XML out of the box. When they do store metadata it is usually specific to the data and data product (regardless of how the metadata is stored).
 
There have been attempts at adding metadata alongside data products such as UK MOD profile of IS0 19115 (MOD profile has problems). The French equivalent of the MOD have for a number of years mandated a metadata format alongside all data products used by them (wish I could find the actual standard for the metadata).
 
The biggest problem is actually mapping from data/'data product' metadata to the target metadata specification.
 
Just to highlight how much a problem the mapping of fields from one metadata format to another is; we have been arguing off and on for more than a year internally about the meaning of dates and which date should be in which field. Two of our big customers do not agree on the meaning of some of the source data date fields and the mappings we have done.
 
I believe ESRI have their own internal metadata format that they provide a tool to translate to other XML metadata specifications.
 
Where I work I have been pushing a per data/'data product' format that is XML based that uses tag value pairs. The tags would basically be a dump of all available  information and specific to each data/'data product'. A set of XSLT scripts would then translate the information to what ever metadata standard you wanted to use and if you needed to modify the mapping you could change the XSLT script for that data/'data product'.
 
We have found that hard-coding the mapping is too costly to maintain and very difficult to get right.
 
Probably not the answer you are looking for.
 
Regards
Damian

Hello Doug and Damian.

I saw your post about ISO 19103, ISO 19115 and  ISO 19115-1. I am starting to look at ticket #3549 (https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/3549). This ticket is a    specific problem for metadata translation for image transformations to the PCIDSK format. The ticket references JPEG and TIFF.

The first thing I thought of was when I saw your posts was mapping the XML metadata from    different sources into an internal format to GDAL, then passing through the information for mapping to the destination format. I suppose there are some    image source formats that don't use XML to store their metadata, so this would require additional handling.

I suppose the internal format to GDAL could be XML in the ISO 19115-1 format.

Am I completely off base here?

Should rather be PYTHONPATH=e:\dwacode\gdal\swig\python\build\lib-XXXXXXX

(replace XXXX by actual name)

This assumes you have built the bindings with "python setup.py build" in the 
e:\dwacode\gdal\swig\python directory

I'm getting closer after installing the MS compiler for Python and 
running "python setup.py build" successfully but still get a failure.

Does the usual GDAL Python user need to go through all this? I see lots 
of information and tutorials about using the GDAL Python API but haven't 
found much about setting up the environment in order to get started.

You also need to put in the PATH the directory where gdalXXX.dll is located

Subject: [gdal-dev] netCDF signed nodata value
Message-ID: <CANzGYpQJMarbJtEqRT76OKD2pqvLFUDAwCM8NA63yW6rYvS32A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello list,

   Just observed a puzzling behaviour of the netCDF driver. When creating a
netCDF dataset of Byte type, the netCDF driver seems to interpret the
nodata value as a signed byte.
 For example a nodata value assigned with -a_nodata 200, will become -56.
Of course one can work around this by simply casting the nodata value (as
e.g. returned by band.GetNoDataValue()) to an unsigned byte.

A simple example:

Hello to GDAL community,

Lately I have been trying to use the SRTM 3 arc second elevation data in a form of ASCII grid (.asc file) downloaded freely from opentopography.org.

The problem is that, decimal degrees for .asc files downloaded from opentopography.org are unprojected.
I have been told that with GDAL python module it is very easy to project the decimal degrees to Mercator:

gdalwarp -s_srs EPSG:4326 -t_srs EPSG:32631 -r cubic Barcelona_original.asc Barcelona_projected_to_Mercator.tif

Then we just need to convert the .tif file to .asc:
gdal_translate -of AAIGrid Barcelona_projected_to_Mercator.tif Barcelona_projected_to_Mercator.asc​

Maybe there is a way of doing this in just one line instead of two, I do no not know.

There is a problem: I am using a Rhino 5 application, which is shipped with IronPython 2.7, not cPython. I did not succeed in installing the GDAL python module into my IronPython.

Is there a way to install GDAL into the IronPython?I googled and found this topic, where it says I need to use C# bindings to import GDAL into IronPython. Can anyone show an example of this?

If not, can in some way the upper two "gdalwarp" and "gdal_translate" methods be replicated in IronPython?
​Thank you.

​Kind regards,
Djordje Spasic

It appears the driver has a sort of data type mis-match with no data
and the band type.  A work around, if available, is to set FORMAT=NC4
as a creation option.  I am not sure if it is in gdal or the netcdf
library at this point.

My understanding is netCDF 3 only supports signed byte and GDAL uses a special 
metadata item _Unsigned=True to correct the interpretation. But it failed to 
use it to interpret correctly the nodata value. Should be fixed by 
https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6175 (happy to have feedback from anyone

Subject: [gdal-dev] Amazon S3 virtual file system /vsis3/ and
	/vsis3_streaming/
Message-ID: <201510271923.57888.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

Just to mention that trunk has received 2 new virtual file systems
/vsis3/ and /vsis3_streaming/ to handle files stored on Amazon S3.

They are specializations of well known /vsicurl/ and /vsicurl_streaming/
to deal with S3 authentication and other particularities. In addition to
reading, /vsis3/ supports sequential writing.

For more details, quoting the docs:

/**
 * \brief Install /vsis3/ Amazon S3 file system handler (requires libcurl)
 *
 * A special file handler is installed that allows on-the-fly random reading of files
 * available in AWS S3 buckets, without prior download of the entire file.
 * It also allows sequential writing of files (no seeks or read operations are then
 * allowed).
 *
 * Recognized filenames are of the form /vsis3/bucket/key where
 * bucket is the name of the S3 bucket and key the S3 object "key", i.e.
 * a filename potentially containing subdirectories.
 *
 * Partial downloads are done with a 16 KB granularity by default.
 * If the driver detects sequential reading
 * it will progressively increase the chunk size up to 2 MB to improve download
 * performance.
 *
 * The AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID configuration options *must* be
 * set.
 * The AWS_REGION configuration option may be set to one of the supported
 * <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_region">S3 regions</a>
 * and defaults to 'us-east-1'
 * The AWS_S3_ENDPOINT configuration option defaults to s3.amazonaws.com.
 *
 * The GDAL_HTTP_PROXY, GDAL_HTTP_PROXYUSERPWD and GDAL_PROXY_AUTH configuration options can be
 * used to define a proxy server. The syntax to use is the one of Curl CURLOPT_PROXY,
 * CURLOPT_PROXYUSERPWD and CURLOPT_PROXYAUTH options.
 *
 * On reading, the file can be cached in RAM by setting the configuration option
 * VSI_CACHE to TRUE. The cache size defaults to 25 MB, but can be modified by setting
 * the configuration option VSI_CACHE_SIZE (in bytes).
 *
 * On writing, the file is uploaded using the S3 <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/mpUploadInitiate.html">multipart upload API</a>.
 * The size of chunks is set to 50 MB by default, allowing creating files up to
 * 500 GB (10000 parts of 50 MB each). If larger files are needed, then increase the
 * value of the VSIS3_CHUNK_SIZE config option to a larger value (expressed in MB).
 * In case the process is killed and the file not properly closed, the multipart upload
 * will remain open, causing Amazon to charge you for the parts storage. You'll have to
 * abort yourself with other means such "ghost" uploads
 * (e.g. with the <a href="http://s3tools.org/s3cmd">s3cmd</a> utility)
 * For files smaller than the chunk size, a simple PUT request is used instead
 * of the multipart upload API.

Thanks for the tips Kyle and Even and for the quick fix!
Not a big netCDF user myself, but have noticed that it seems to be the
standard format for many of my colleagues who work in climatology. So good
to get this fixed!

Cheers,
Simon

Subject: [gdal-dev] GDALGrid
Message-ID: <5630903D.8020504@gmail.com>

The documentation of GDALGrid in gdal_utils.h claims it to

" Converts raster data between different formats."

Although it is the same as gdal_grid, which creates regular grid from 
the scattered data, i.e., vector data source.

It seems to work, also from the bindings, if one uses a vector data 
source as the source dataset. That requires using OGRDataSourceShadow in 
the definition of the method in gdal.i & definition of 
OGRDataSourceShadow with typedef.

I can fix the bindings but I rather not touch gdal_grid_lib.cpp - it 
also has the ugly ^M since it is in DOS text format. I think its 
svn:mime-type needs to be set or something.

Best,

Ari

Copy&paste from GDALTranslate(). Fixed

Following the unification, I decided to use only GDALDatasetH even when a 
vector datasource is expected/output. So you may have to use GDALOpenEx() to 
open the vector dataset so as to get a GDALDatasetH instead of the legacy 
OGRDataSourceH.

Or perhaps we could have some tricks at the SWIG level so as to have the 
possibility to use a OGRDataSourceShadow as well, but I wasn't brave enough to 
try that so I happily let it to you if you want.

The same thing is in Rasterize, which is clearly also only for vector 
datasources.

I know the unification below but it is not in the bindings. To me it 
looks very simple and working solution to just add

typedef void OGRDataSourceShadow;

into gdal.i - similarly as there is already

typedef void OGRLayerShadow;

etc.

and then use OGRDataSourceShadow in those methods, which clearly expect 
vector datasources.

Making the unification in bindings seems much bigger task and I'd 
postpone it.

How is it in Python bindings? I don't understand how they can be used to 
run Grid without this change.

BTW, I'm making these utilities as methods in the Perl bindings since 
Rasterize is clearly a method for OGR DataSource class and not a 
non-object-oriented subroutine.

Best,

Ari

Well, GDALDatasetShadow has all methods related to Layers, so you can use it 
as a complete replacement of OGRDatasetShadow

Introducing more - exclusive - uses of OGRDataSource wouldn't really be 
consistant with the unification.
Perhaps as additional possibilities if there's a way of doing so.

Well, just use gdal.OpenEx('bla', gdal.OF_VECTOR) and you're done : see 
https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/utilities/test_ogr2ogr_lib.py or  
https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/autotest/utilities/test_gdal_rasterize_lib.py

ok, I'll add a method to force a OGR data source object into a GDAL 
dataset into the Perl bindings, which I can use in cases like this.

I guess unifying the classes in the bindings is something to be done in 
the future.

I can also confirm that with -co FORMAT=NC4 everything seems to work as
expected, also with other netCDF readers...

Subject: [gdal-dev] Warning-free builds :-)
Message-ID: <201510291751.17604.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi,

We've achieved an important and symbolic milestone that will mean something to 
developers: most of our (Unix) builds are warning free (for the library + 
utilities) ! That is they pass with -Wall -Wextra -Werror compiler options. 
Not bad for a ~ 400 K effective line of code project ( ~ 800 K, with white 
lines + comments).

So celebrate that and please keep it that way now ! And thanks to all those 
who have helped achieving this.

More specifically ./configure will enable -Wall -Wextra and other warnings (-
Winit-self -Wunused-parameter -Wmissing-prototypes -Wmissing-declarations -
Wformat -Werror=format-security -Wno-format-nonliteral -Werror=vla -
Werror=declaration-after-statement  -Wno-clobbered -Wunused-private-field), but 
*not* with -Werror (-Werror means that any warning will be interpreted as an 
error and fail the build).

I haven't dared enabling -Werror by default due to the almost infinite possible 
configurations (choice of dependencies x choice of compilers) that make it 
impossible to be sure there isn't one that will throw some warning. I was 
wondering if we couldn't have a --enable-werror option that could default to 
yes for --enable-debug builds (and no for regular builds), so that developers 
have no excuse to commit warnings ?

Trick to use -Werror: "make USER_DEFS=-Werror". You can also do CPPFLAGS=-
Werror ./configure , but that may interfere with the detection of some 
libraries.

Most Travis CI builds have already -Werror enabled :
- the default one : https://travis-ci.org/OSGeo/gdal (thus github pull 
requests will be affected by that too)
- and at https://travis-ci.org/rouault/gdal_coverage/builds :
	* trunk_with_coverage
	* python3
	* trunk_travis_macosx
	* trunk_mingw
	* trunk_mingw_w64
	* trunk_android
	* trunk_gcc4.8_stdc11
   so everything but trunk_gcc5.2_sanitize since gcc 5.2 warns about our own 
deprecated symbols for some reason

So even if your configuration is warning free, it is important to keep an eye 
on the above links (or IRC bot messages).

Making sure we don't hit warnings is important since it can save bugs in 
practice. For example, the class of bugs to which one reported yesterday 
(https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/ticket/6183) belongs to will no longer be 
possible with the added -Wmissing-prototypes and -Wmissing-declarations.

Even

PS: I had issues with most proprietary SDK whose headers are not warning free. 
A trick is to create a .h wrapper on top of which you put this before 
including the SDK headers, so as to shut all warnings for the rest of the file 
:

#ifdef HAVE_GCC_SYSTEM_HEADER
#pragma GCC system_header
#endif

(will work too with clang)

See 
https://svn.osgeo.org/gdal/trunk/gdal/ogr/ogrsf_frmts/filegdb/filegdbsdk_headers.h

On which platforms and which CPU types?  Hopefully this includes a build
on each of the 4 common BSDs and Illumos and perhaps OS X, and not only
i386 and amd64 but also a few things like sparc64 and arm.

(The general notion of cleaning up code that causes warnings is great; I
don't mean to suggest otherwise.)

OS X as mentionned in my email, but I haven't tested other BSDs or Illumos (do 
people actually still use that beast...). Anyway people are welcome to test 
and provide fixes if there found issues. The Android build is a ARM one.

Hey,
So I am exporting a raster and would like to set the VerticalUnitsGeoKey to
feet. I have tried to use the SetUnitType( const char * ) member function of
GDALRasterBand without success. I have looked at the internal code the
driver uses to set this flag, but would like to avoid having to reopen the
file to do this after I have finished the export. Is there any standard
wayto set GeoTIFF tags?

SetUnitType() will write a GDAL metadata in the TIFFTAG_GDAL_METADATA XML tag

Probably should have specified that I'm working in c++. Would the SetMetaData

Hi,

Just a reminder as a number of people with a Trac account have apparently not  
yet updated their preferences to register their email (especially I think for 
people with accounts older than a few months, before the Trac software 
upgrade)

So check https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/prefs

If you don't do it, you will not get notified on comments in tickets.

David,

I'd advise creating a Trac ticket with it as an attachemnt :

https://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/newticket

And notify the list so that people that want to review it are aware.

If the code doesn't depend on new dependencies (which must be the case if it 
is based on ODBC support), you might also try to submit it as a pull request 
against the git mirror at https://github.com/OSGeo/gdal, so as to check there 
are not compiler warnings against this target at least (since warning are not 
going to be treated as errors.)

Subject: [gdal-dev] Refreshing commiter list
Message-ID: <201510311645.13532.even.rouault@spatialys.com>

Hi all and PSC especially,

Our COMMITERS file currently list 57 people with SVN commit rights. The truth 
is that only a portion of them make use of them (one of them has apparently 
never used them according to svn log!, a bunch not in the last 10 years...). 
So I was wondering if we shouldn't check with them to make sure they are still 
interested in the project, and in keeping their commit rights so we can 
maintain a more up-to-date list of committers/maintainers and have 3 
categories :
- Active : use their commit rights regularly
- Occasionally active: might only use them unfrequently, but could still be 
interested in committing changes from time to time
- Past : no longer interested in committing code.

We could give figures to what active or occasionally active means, but the 
intent is not "punishing" anyone, just making sure people haven't shifted 
completly to other interests. This could be give a better picture to casual 
contributors of who is responsible/interested in what.

Opionions ?
