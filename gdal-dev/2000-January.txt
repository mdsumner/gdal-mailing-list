Subject: [gdal-dev] 2nd gen DOQ translator
Message-ID: <ML-1.3.2.948214669.4978.shadow@j...>

Using the model provided by the 1st gen DOQ translator (reader) I wrote one for
the 2nd gen format. I commited it to CVS but did not add the call to the init
function for it. If anyone else would like to test it, please feel free to bug
me; I'm pretty sure it works fine.

And incidentally, I think it would be useful if the gtiff writer could write
out a tiff description tag, especially for cases like the usgs DOQs where the
title info is available. Maybe I'll work on that.

I commited patches for it, but did not commit patches which make the
bridge able to use it, and gdal_translate include it. I can send those if
anyone cares.

Derrick,

Thanks for the DOQ2 support, and the descriptions. I would prefer that the
GetDescription() method remain DOQ specific for the time being (it seems it
isn't implemented on the GDALDataset base class). It is my intent to 
implement a generic metadata strategy at some point, and at that point to 
update various tools to carry the metadata. Description would just be one
of potentially many pieces of metadata. 

I haven't yet worked out a strategy I want to follow, nor have I had a 
compelling need. 

Later,

Actually, it is implemented on the GDALDataser base class, but I didn't
commit those patches

Yeah, there were actually a few other items I wanted to copy (Date & Time)
but the big one was description, so I implemented that and left the rest.
