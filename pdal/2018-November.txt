Regarding these changes:

 * Any code coming from Entwine is now BSD because Hobu is relicensing
   it
 * Two LGPLv2 files from Eigen are removed. We are not using them and we
   want to keep clean (#2265)

Are you trying to get rid of LGPL licensed code?

If so, there is another Eigen file under that license:

 vendor/eigen/Eigen/src/OrderingMethods/Amd.h

Kind Regards,

Bas

Yes, we want to keep PDAL clean of any LGPL code so people can be
confident of the licensing status of the entire PDAL package as BSD. I
hadn't realized eigen had such a mix of stuff in it. We probably should
reconsider its placement in the vendor/ directory for 1.9 given the
potential for unintended licensing considerations.

We intend to remove this one too in RC3/Final.

Thanks for the reports.

Yes, eigen is PITA regarding licensing & copyright, see:

Hello All,

I am using the osgeo4W64 binaries for pdal and created a simple console
applicaiton with the below code.
// ConsoleApplication1.cpp : Defines the entry point for the console
application.
//

#include "stdafx.h"
#include <memory>
#include <pdal/PointTable.hpp>
#include <pdal/PointView.hpp>
#include <pdal/io/LasReader.hpp>
#include <pdal/io/LasHeader.hpp>
#include <pdal/Options.hpp>

int main()
{
pdal::Option las_opt("filename", "D:\\Data\\test_part.las");
pdal::Options las_opts;
las_opts.add(las_opt);
pdal::PointTable table;
pdal::LasReader las_reader;
las_reader.setOptions(las_opts);
las_reader.prepare(table);
pdal::PointViewSet point_view_set = las_reader.execute(table);
//pdal::PointViewPtr point_view = *point_view_set.begin();
//pdal::Dimension::IdList dims = point_view->dims();
//pdal::LasHeader las_header = las_reader.header();
    return 0;
}

and I get following errors.

That was helpful, I am able to compile now. But when I run it. I get.

Unhandled exception at 0x00007FFFBC3CA388 in ConsoleApplication1.exe:
Microsoft C++ exception: std::bad_alloc at memory location
0x0000008955EFC6C0. occurred

Any Idea which library is causing this.

Subject: [pdal] assign projection info without creating new file
Message-ID: <CACrek76kxOoWGbhsweoqedGU+zoxXyi1F25Hucj4sxnpfC7EhQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I have thousands of .laz files that have no projection information.  From
my contact, I received the EPSG codes for the datasets.  I can apply them
with a pipeline such as:

{

    "pipeline": [

        {

            "type" : "readers.las",

               "filename": "input.laz"

           },

        {

            "type" : "writers.las",

               "filename": "output.laz",

            "a_srs": "EPSG:2193+7839"

           }

    ]

}


I suppose I could just then do  "mv output.laz input.laz" in a bash script
to end up with a single file with the proper projection in the header.

My question: Is there a way I can do it without creating an intermediary
file?  I tried the obvious of reading and writing to input.laz, but that
didn't work.  With thousands of files, it seems like it could save some
time.  Just curious.

Thanks,

matt.

Updating SRS information in-place is very problematic. For LAS files,
the SRS information might be in the VLRs, or it might be at the end of
the file in the EVLR (LAS 1.4). The updated SRS information might be
larger than the old SRS info, and would write over good data if it were
simply slammed into place.

PDAL neither attempts to guess nor attempts to make ransom notes from
SRS magazine lettering for you. You need to rewrite the file(s).

Not with PDAL.  You may be able to do this with lastools, but you also may
not be able to do it at all, depending on how the file is formatted.  The
SRS information is stored in VLRs, and if the VLRs aren't large enough to
fit the new SRS, you're out of luck.

Subject: [pdal] Entwine directory permissions on Linux
Message-ID: <06fdfcaf-5a80-c008-4391-8e9e40f5e954@gmail.com>

Is there a reason Entwine (actually arbiter) creates directories with mask 744 on Linux instead of 755 or just using 777 and letting the user control the actual permissions with their umask?  744 seems particularly strange (vs 700 or 755) as read w/o execute on a directory doesn't get you much.

The line in question is arbiter.cpp:1094 in mkdirp(std::string raw):

 #ifndef ARBITER_WINDOWS
        const bool err(::mkdir(cur.c_str(), S_IRWXU | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH));
         if (err && errno != EEXIST) return false;
 #else

Subject: [pdal] Splitting LAS file into multiple outputs
Message-ID: <DB6C9333CF905C418FCA62058C6781890499250C@prdassexch01.ad.linz.govt.nz>

Hi guys,

Hope you're having a good week :) I was wondering if there was a way to split an input LAS file into multiple LAS outputs, using shapefile geometry boundaries (and conserving the number of total points)?

I've looked at the example below and noticed it was for one output only [pdal pipeline ] ;

https://pdal.io/workshop/exercises/analysis/clipping/clipping.html

Other options I've looked at;
pdal split seems to only split by number of points?
pdal tile seems to only give square tile outputs?

Please let me know if I've overlooked something.

Many thanks and kind regards,

I don't think we do this directly, though it has been discussed.  You can
pass the geometries into filters.crop, but you need to pass WKT and then
use a writer that will write multiple views (LAS, BPF, OGR, GDAL).  If your
geometries don't overlap and overlap all points, you should get the same
number on output as on input.

Subject: [pdal] pgpointcloud reader streaming
Message-ID: <HE1PR03MB13388B932CF475A562C5D6C2CADA0@HE1PR03MB1338.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

We are using PDAL 1.7.1 pipeline to read pgpointcloud data from PostgreSQL verion 10 and rasterize the data using GDAL writer.

This pipeline works great but we are seeing very high memory usage and in some cases "out of memory" error (> 40GB memory usage). We have adjusted the raster resolution and size to reduce the issue. Running on Windows 10.

We are not using any filters in the pipeline.

Using streaming will reduce memory requirements according to "Processing Modes" section https://pdal.io/pipeline.html.

Does pgpointcloud reader support streamming? The documentation does not say either way. We are guessing it does not :-)

If streaming is not supported, would it be possible to add this feature? Is this a complicated feature to implement?

Kind regards, Lars

I don't think it looks too difficult to implement.

There is also at least one improvement in the GDALWriter that might reduce
memory usage some, but I haven't had time to look into it.

Andrew,

Thank you for the feedback.

I added a ticket for pgpointcloud streaming;
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2280

It would be helpful if you could add a ticket for improvement in GDALWriter. Thanks 😊

kind regards, Lars

I would like to do it from the c++ API.
