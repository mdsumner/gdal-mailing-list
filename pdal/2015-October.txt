Considering an earlier discussion about mimicking the behaviour of GDAL in
PDAL (http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/pdal/2015-September/000744.html), I
had 2 ideas about improved dbase functionality:

1. Give the option to add filenames to the patches
An extra column that gives the name of the original laz file would
tremendously improve the administration of importing and updating your
pointcloud data. Imagine you receive a new lasfile with updated points (new
classification for instance), you would like to replace only those points
in your dbase, but there is no way to tell which patch originated from
which file.

2. Give an option for out-db pointclouds
In postgres it is possible to store your raster files out-db. This makes
sense when you don't tile your rasters for delivery speed but merely keep
them in storage for incidental use. There is still the advantage of
administration of metadata in the database and doing complex spatial
queries, whereas the actual bulk of files is remains where they are. PDAL's
readers and writes would be an intermediary between the dbase and the
pointcloud files.

My guess is that option 1 should be fairly simple to implement (maybe it
already exists?) but that option 2 can me a major rework. I'd be happy to
share more of my workflow if that helps in the discussion.

Best,
 Tom

Could one not store this in a separate table along with the PCID and then
join?

Yes, that?s how it should be done. Or, at least adding a pc_files ( file_id, file_name ) table and a file_id column to the target pointcloud table.?

Additionally, our typical scenario is to use PDAL pipeline's "serialization" method to fetch the pcid that was written by PDAL and then insert/update any data using that information. This allows you to link up what was written with your own processing.

> $ pdal pipeline myfile.xml --pipeline-serialization serialized.xml

Hope this helps,

I am writing over a thousand laz files, all using the same PCID.
Does this mean that I should better create one PCID for every file that I
import?

Is there a downside to that strategy? You very likely want to have partitioned tables anyway, so you can quickly drop big chunks of data if you need. When our CRREL group manages a huge Oracle point cloud database, we utilize the partitioning approach which necessitates individual pcid (we group a bunch of logically-together files into a a single partition as needed) for each file. 

You can use the post_sql option of the driver to write to a specific column for the specific file as you are loading. This would allow you to get the arrangement you want. It's not clear that you should work so hard to achieve it, though that's probably a question for the database folks rather than myself.

Maybe no downside, it's just my background with gis systems that makes me
think the wrong way. I was looking at the PCID table as a kind of
spatial-reference table, where you can re-use every reference over and over
for different tables with geometry. Up to now it served us ok to deal with
multiple input files using the same PCID, but I can see the limitations.

In the end we might have to deal with partitions as well, since disks are
getting full. Is there any writing (articles, blog) you can share about
your experiences?

Best,
 Tom

Message-ID: <CAH0YoEOTcO0akq0dUNaabgKucvJFABeB7iPwti9ENp3j4ntidg@mail.gmail.com>

I’m trying to add colour to a laz file with approx 8 Mpts using a
pipeline with filters.colorization and a 10000 px x 10000 px geotiff
orthophoto, covering the same 1 km x 1 km tile as the laz file (see
details below).

It works fine but takes almost 4 minutes. The same operation using the
LAStools lascolor tool gives similar results for a runtime of around
15 seconds - a factor of 15 difference.

Is this as expected, or am I doing something stupid?

Not expected and you aren't stupid.

This sounds like a good test case for us to optimize. How we use GDAL to fetch the raster pixels is not so smart. Can you send me info privately to work with this set?

Thomas,

Thanks for the great test case. The first issue is that the TIFF is striped instead of tiled. The way PDAL uses GDAL to fetch pixel information is indeed not so smart in that scenario, and it is part of the penalty we see.

Here's my baseline output with your TIFF and LAZ file.

> [hobu at pyro knudsen (las-srs-read-in-initialize)]$ time ~/dev/git/pdal/bin/pdal pipeline striped.xml
> 
> real	2m30.110s
> user	1m46.660s
> sys	0m42.637s

I tiled the TIFF with

> $ gdal_translate orto_6173_727.tif orth-tiled.tif -co TILED=YES

and I get the following output:

> [hobu at pyro knudsen (las-srs-read-in-initialize)]$ time ~/dev/git/pdal/bin/pdal pipeline -i tiled.xml
> 
> real	0m35.574s
> user	0m33.586s
> sys	0m1.068s

I will work on the PDAL part of it and get back to you.

Thanks again!

Howard

Thanks Howard, for the quick diagnostic and workaround. We have
checked it here and get similar results. Huge improvement! Looking
forward to see what can be accomplished at the PDAL end of the
pipeline.
