Subject: [pdal] PDAL reading and writing memory issue
Message-ID: <736cff60d72f410eab94b1cfa31ee756@lillemetropole.fr>

Hi,

I'm currently developing a Python tool called pdal-parallelizer which allows to simply parallelize pdal pipelines executions using Dask and I'm facing a problem due to PDAL.

My pipelines are executed on a Dask Cluster, with a defined number of processes. For small clouds processing or with stream mode execution, everything works well. But when I try to process larger clouds, I encounter memory issues. In fact, there is a lot of "unmanaged memory" on my processes what cause the failure of the execution, and I assume this unmanaged memory is due to the reading and writing of the clouds in the pipeline.

I did some researches and found the work of Matrin Dobias (@wonder-sk on GitHub) on PDAL wrench, it's something similar to pdal-parallelizer so I guess he faced the same problem. I search in his code and found the function used for launch work in parallel, but there is something I don't understand : what the reset() method does ? (https://github.com/PDAL/wrench/blob/01c3eda6e6eca669436af8d75b04db1985cfab01/src/utils.cpp#L127) Is this method can actually solve my problem ? Also, is there any way to read and write the clouds we want to process outside a PDAL pipeline ?

Regards

Subject: [pdal] Converting PLY file into PLY bin file?
Message-ID: <CAPA7-NHbVZVfuzy+zCDvoH2TSJKv1qaztq+HMNg3=gsbAsVuqw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi All,

I would like to convert PLY ASCII LiDAR files into PLY bin files using
PDAL. Is it possible? I would appreciate any suggestions.

Thank you

Shukhrat

Look at the `storage_mode` parameter on the PLY writer
https://pdal.io/en/latest/stages/writers.ply.html#writers-ply

You should be able to create a small pipeline that reads the ascii file and
writes a binary PLY file or use `pdal translate`
