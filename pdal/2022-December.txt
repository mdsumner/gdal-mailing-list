Subject: [pdal] About litree filter output: "PDAL: All points collinear"
Message-ID: <CAP=Ak6g1b7x7DyBSU5Zn3Xa1VWY4gvAe6qdDHCB6gGP9rvEXGA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone:
I have a question about the use of filters.litree. When I run:

$ pdal pipeline ./litree_prueba.json

where de ./litree_prueba.json:

[
       "./input.las"
    {
        "type":"filters.hag_delaunay"
    },
    {
        "type":"filters.sort",
        "dimension":"HeightAboveGround",
        "order":"DESC"
    },
    {
        "type":"filters.litree",
        "min_points":50,
        "min_height":3.0,
        "radius":50.0
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.las",
        "filename":"./output.as",
        "minor_version":4,
        "extra_dims":"all"
    }
]

I get de following output:
"PDAL: All points collinear"

And the file "output.las" was never created.

Could you guide me on what I'm doing wrong, please?

Thank you

Ulises

I've seen that error before when using hag_delaunay.? It's complaining it can't make triangles (delaunay triangulation) because it thinks all of the input points fall on a line.? I found that sometimes hag_nn will work in these situations.? It has been awhile since I've hit that error (so I was using an older version of PDAL), it was sporadic (only occurred on some input tiles) and I didn't have time to track down the exact points that were causing it.

I'm assuming (dangerous, I know) that PDAL is looking at some subset of close points when it is constructing the triangulation and that the error is stating that all points were collinear in one/some of those subsets rather than saying that the entire point cloud is collinear.? However, if all of the source points are actually all collinear, then that would explain it.

If I remember right, this tended to happen on messy (noisy), very dense (higher point density than reasonable given the precision of the measurements) point clouds where I suspect that it may have been possible for the point cloud to have areas where there were many points at the same or nearly the same X,Y,Z.? Another possibility was the error being triggered by some odd (noise) points forming nonsensical geometries.? But as I said, I never did have time to track down the root cause for sure.

Hi Jim:

Thank you very much for answering.

I thought that the origin of the problem was due to the fact that the
input.las file was made from the union of several files obtained by (TLS)
terrestrial scanning. I can't understand the concept of PointView, and I
imagined that the error was that there were many points where the
terrestrial scanner is located, but when making a large file made of small
files, that information was lost.

I did a test with a single file and got good results even though multiple
trees were considered under the same ClusterID. I subsampled the original
file with filters.sample.radios=0.020. And to this file I applied the
pipeline that I sent in my previous email with small modifications.
Processing time was around 24 hours.

In total I have 47 scans of that piece of rainforest. A question: What do
you think about the processing time of a large file that contains the 47
scans: Could it take 24 hours X 47 files = 1128 hours?

Regards

Ulises

The AWS spot rate for a c7g.2xlarge in the Oregon region is $0.142. That's 8 cpus and 16gb of RAM. Naively splitting your 1128 compute hours over that (1128/8 * 0.142) brings up a total cost of $20.002 

PDAL purposefully does not split up data and try to internally optimize the computing of pipelines because they are extremely sensitive to the various filters and their configurations. It is on users to divide and conquer on their own with PDAL. For filters.litree, that means breaking the data up and trying to find the filters.sample.radius setting that gives you good enough results without blowing up memory or computation time.

Your pipeline with filters.litree is obviously not very efficient, but the cost in effort to optimize it for one-time compute jobs far outstrips the cost of parallelizing the computation in the cloud somewhere and being done with it. That math obviously changes if you need to process the entire rainforest with filters.litree :)
