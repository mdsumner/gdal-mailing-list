Hi,

I try to read las file with PDAL lib, 
I do a really simple project that I find in :
http://www.lidarnews.com/content/view/8880/65/
but it crash on exec

#include <pdal/drivers/las/Reader.hpp>
#include <pdal/PointBuffer.hpp>
#include <pdal/Stage.hpp>
#include <pdal/StageIterator.hpp>
#include <pdal/SpatialReference.hpp>
#include <pdal/Schema.hpp>

int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
  pdal::drivers::las::Reader reader("interesting.las");
  reader.initialize();
  const pdal::Schema& schema = reader.getSchema();
  pdal::PointBuffer data(schema, 100);
  pdal::StageSequentialIterator* iterator =
reader.createSequentialIterator(data);
  iterator->read(data);
}

It crash on reader.initialize();
A buffer overflow has occurred in test.exe that damaged the internal state
of the program.
Exception Microsoft C++?: pdal::option_not_found


Someone did know where is my mistake?

Regards

Nicolas -

That article was written 18 months ago when PDAL was still evolving -- I'm sure those code exsmples don't correspond well to the current codebase. 

PDAL does have good docs, those should be a better guide for you.

Try trapping for the error and it should tell you which option it thinks is missing.

int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
    try{
  
         pdal::drivers::las::Reader reader("interesting.las");
         reader.initialize();
         const pdal::Schema& schema = reader.getSchema();

        reader.createSequentialIterator(data);
         iterator->read(data);
    } catch (pdal::pdal_error& e)
   {
        std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
   }
}

Hi,

Sorry for delay,
I finally find why that doesn't work, it cause I have trouble do compile
pdal in debug mode probably.
Because I have look example of pcinfo

This part for beginning 
Options readerOptions;
    {
        if (m_usestdin)
            m_inputFile = "STDIN";
        readerOptions.add<std::string>("filename", m_inputFile);
        readerOptions.add<bool>("debug", isDebug());
        readerOptions.add<boost::uint32_t>("verbose", getVerboseLevel());
    }
And I replace my test with this and I have same problem when I go to
readerOptions.add ( crash ) 
So I try too anderstand, and I see when I compile in debug pdal proj I have
same problem pcinfo and other doesn?t work.

I don?t know why, I compiled with OSGeo4W ( no debug mode ) which is some
mix of compiler version so I recompile gdal with vc2009 and I use FLANN
compiled with the same.

But if I lunch app in release that work correctly and my previous code too.

Regards
Nicolas

Message-ID: <CAPrisyq-Owia1W6ys6rjKtG54wLJCw+M_mCVWmFW7h+-iZQ-Ow@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I've just started looking into pdal for use as part of a lidar
processing and archive pipeline.  It's looking great so far, but will
take some time to digest since the docs are a little patchy ;-)

One thing which isn't clear to me is how quantization works when
output to las is desired.  I'll ultimately be using the C++ API, but
as a test I've connecting drivers.faux.reader up to drivers.las.writer
with the following XML pipeline

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Pipeline version="1.0">
    <Writer type="drivers.las.writer">
        <Option name="filename">
            faux.las
        </Option>
        <Reader type="drivers.faux.reader">
            <Option name="mode">
                random
            </Option>
            <Option name="bounds">
                ([0,10],[0,10],[0,2])
            </Option>
            <Option name="num_points">
                100000
            </Option>
        </Reader>
    </Writer>
</Pipeline>

Unfortunately the output range is odd which leads me to believe that
I've reinterpreted the doubles which are coming out of faux.reader as
integers or something stupid like that.  Some pointers in the
direction of what I'm doing wrong would be much appreciated.

Thanks!
~Chris

Subject: [pdal] PostGIS for Travis CI configuration
Message-ID: <CABUeae8oU4S1X4vk5F3B71bBWCtt1dsQdHovftxOL6z7u+z4JQ@mail.gmail.com>

Folks,

I added basic setup of Travis CI service for PDAL.
The status page is available here

https://travis-ci.org/PDAL/PDAL

In next iterations, I'm going to configure build with all features,
so all tests are run.

Travis CI uses Ubuntu 12.04, so it installs some newer packages
from ppa:ubuntugis, like GDAL 1.9.
I have question about PostgreSQL/PostGIS, what versions we
need in order to build with -DWITH_PGPOINTCLOUD=ON?

Are we fine with stable
ppa:ubuntugis/ppa
or
ppa:ubuntugis/ubuntugis-unstable
or
do we need to build PostGIS?

Best regards,
--

The drivers.las.writer will take the first "X" dimension it finds in the schema (in this case it is the X dimension of double's from the drivers.faux.reader), cast it to a int32_t, and write that into the file. It is on you to make sure that the data are appropriately scaled and match the header of the LAS file you are writing.

For example, the following pipeline will set the scale for the X, Y, Z dimensions to 0.1, and set the offset to 2.0. The drivers.faux.reader will simply return doubles between 0-10 for X, Y, and 0-2 for Z. 

Make sure to take a peek at the pipeline xml files in test/data for inspiration on filters and operations to try.

Hope this helps,

Howard

Hi folks,
I was wondering if there were any plans to add any utilities for
normalizing the z values to the value of either an external raster ( via
gdal) or from an internally created TIN of the bare earth points.  ( I'm
guessing Paul has some thoughts about doing this inside Postgres/Postgis)

You could do this with a Python filters.programmable filter. Additionally, PDAL does have the filters.colorization, which is really just a specialized "overlay these points on a GDAL raster and fetch the RGB values" operation. You could set it to fetch a single value into the Z dimension from the raster, but not do any math on it. The programmable filter would allow you to do whatever you want in Python land, and then stuff the value back into the Z dimension.

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/blob/master/test/data/plang/predicate-keep-specified-returns.xml is an example that creates a "keep" mask for predicate-type operations. In combination with a programmable example like https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/blob/master/test/unit/plang/ProgrammableFilterTest.cpp you might find enough inspiration to combine it with numpy-fetching GDAL operations.

Hope this helps,

Howard

Thanks for doing this! This will allow me to shutdown http://jenkins.pointcloud.org when the server it is hosted on is decommissioned at the end of August.

I don't see any integrated tests on the PDAL side for pgpointcloud, so I'm assuming that all testing related to Paul's efforts exist on the extension (rather than PDAL) side for now. We don't need to build PostGIS, just pgpointcloud, and install the extension before testing it.

Ah I see now - the raw buffer data is interpreted as int32_t via
getField<int32_t>() in las/Writer.cpp, but I've supplied it with doubles in
the buffer so bad things are obviously going to happen.

It would be nice for this error to be more transparent to the end user.  Would
modifying las::Writer::writeBufferBegin() or las::Writer::writeBuffer() to
check that the types are consistent be the right thing?  I'm happy to submit a
pull request for this.

I see. In case we need testing against Oracle, then we will have to
connect  to external database. I have VM with Oracle XE that I use for SOCI,
but not sure if would be feature-capable for PDAL.

Ok, I'll try to build Paul's pgpc in next iteration.

According to CMakeLists.txt, there are several dependencies we
don't build PDAL with, I'll be adding them too.

Hi,

One more thing:

Due to problems with libgeotiff 1.3, we have to build and install
libgeotiff 1.4.
Does it matter that it is built with:

zlib support......: no
jpeg support......: no

Albert,

Thank you for the explanation.

On Travis CI we can only use Ubuntu 12.04, but the custom virtual machine
Oracle may be possible on our own server though.

Yes, that's strictly for running integration tests only.

Support for point clouds (as well as tins and other 3D structures) is only in Oracle Enterprise Edition with the Spatial option.
Oracle EE (and other software) is freely available for product development, testing, evaluations and demos at: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/index.html

You can also get a ready-for-use virtual machine with Oracle EE 11.2.0.3 pre-installed from here: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/community/developer-vm/index.html. This is also strictly for testing and evaluations.

Subject: [pdal] questions about iterator and buffer semantics
Message-ID: <CAPrisyqQFr=Lp1HY2+-snUs=4irQN=OnZAu0EA5zpvAnPN_qhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I've been digging through the code to solve a segfault when the las
reader is connected to a mosaic filter with a small chunk size.
Here's a pipeline which will crash pcpipeline when executed with
--chunk-size 100 (anything smaller than the number of points in the
file should lead to the crash).

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Pipeline version="1.0">
    <Writer type="drivers.faux.writer">
        <MultiFilter type="filters.mosaic">
            <Reader type="drivers.las.reader">
                <Option name="filename">
                    autzen-thin.las
                </Option>
            </Reader>
        </MultiFilter>
    </Writer>
</Pipeline>

I've submitted a pull request which fixes the problem
(https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/146), but without knowing the
intended iterator semantics it's hard to know whether my fix is in
keeping with the overall design.  So, here's some questions:

Is StageIterator::read() allowed to be supplied with multiple buffers?
 That is, I'm imagining something like

PointBuffer buf1(...);
StageSequentialIterator* iter = someStage->createSequentialIterator(buf1);
PointBuffer buf2(...), buf3(...);
iter.read(buf2);
iter.read(buf3);

If no, then this bug is really a bug in Mosaic, which creates
temporary buffers inside a loop and copies results from those into the
output buffer.  In this case, it's also arguably a deficiency in the
API, which allows various buffer arguments to read().

If the user *is* allowed to pass multiple buffers to iter.read(), then
why do the iterator constructors require a buffer?  As far as I can
tell, the only place that StageIterator::getBuffer() is called is by
the las reader random iterator, and I just removed that usage in the
above pull request!


On a slightly different topic, I'm curious about the reason that
readBufferBegin() and readBufferEnd() are required, since these always
seem to simply bracket readBuffer().  If this is true, it seems like
these just lead to a more stateful and confusing API.


I'm still very much liking the library, despite the above nitpicking :)

On further testing, I've found that disabling the dimension caching between
calls to read() does have a measurable performance impact in some cases.  When
reading an uncompressed las file in small chunks (buffer size of 1000) the
patch above causes a 50% performance degradation or so.

This is a bit surprising as it indicates the cost of dimension lookup in the
schema is rather large, unless there's something else I'm missing.  I'll have
to do some additional performance testing to try to get to the bottom of this.

Subject: [pdal] Array Dimensions
Message-ID: <CAPrisyrxbhfxbL4k6U31HZ0F-3zZxDYhuThfdWMOx-xvGahTHg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

Sorry to bombard the list with so much mail, I'll try to hold off a bit after
this one.

After a bit of hacking on the weekend I'm fairly confident that pdal will work
for us, with the possible exception of one major feature which appears to be
missing from PointBuffer: Dimensions which hold short fixed size arrays rather
than single elements.

The problem is that sometimes a Dimension logically contains more than one
element, and it doesn't make sense to name the elements independently.  For
example, suppose I want to write a filter which computes local geometric
properties using the eigenstructure of the local covariance matrix.  The
output from this is naturally represented as a 3-vector of eigenvalues and a
3x3 matrix of eigenvectors per point.  Now, I could name each of these using
their own Dimension, but that introduces unnecessary overhead and the
resulting components don't make logical sense on their own.

I'm imagining something like

PointBuffer buf(...);
const Dimension& eigenValuesDim = buf.getSchema().getDimension("EigenValues");
// ...
float* vals = buf.getArrayField<float>(eigenValuesDim, 0);

If the size is known at compile time, the following would pretty much work
already

const boost::array<float,9>& vals =
    buf.getField<boost::array<float,9> >(eigenValuesDim, 0);


Other libraries agree that this is a useful feature, for example PCL has
explicit support for it in their PCD file format.

I'm certainly willing to write code to make this work, but I'm not sure how
large a job it would be, so I'd need some guidance about whether it's a
desired feature before I start anything.  If not, I may have to implement a
point buffer class of my own, but I like to avoid reinventing wheels where
possible.


Thanks,
~Chris
