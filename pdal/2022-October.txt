Subject: [pdal] AWS ept.json data naming convention?
Message-ID: <DM6PR04MB685726BFBE02CE048BF92085CB209@DM6PR04MB6857.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,
First - thanks for all the help in figuring out NOT to use ArcGIS conda to install pdal and to use regular conda instead. It's all working much better now.

I'm trying to script building DEMs for USGS HUC12s and I'm having difficulty figuring out the naming convention used to name some of the ept.json files. It says the project name was used (https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/) but that doesn't seem to be entirely correct but it's usually workunit. I got the USGS workunit and project names plus other data from this file:
https://rockyweb.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/metadata/WESM.gpkg

It does not correspond to workunit name (not project) when the EPT file does not start with USGS_LPC. When it starts with USGS_LPC it seems to be based on a combination of project name and year from the opr_pub_date plus some other stuff. For example, one inconsistency is:

https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/USGS_LPC_KS_Statewide_B1_2017_LAS_2018/ept.json

workunit: KS_Statewide_2017
project: KS_Statewide4County_2017_A18
opr_pub_date: 2018-11-15

Can anyone provide better guidance on how I should build the ept.json file names? Or maybe the USGS entwine map polygon data is downloadable?

Thank you!
Brian

https://github.com/hobuinc/usgs-lidar/blob/master/boundaries/resources.geojson is built nightly from crawling the s3://usgs-lidar-public bucket. I think this is what you want.

That would do pretty well. I want to build using the most recent data so I'll just use the year off the end of the ept.json folder name. Thanks again!

Hello,
I am able to compile PDAL in visual studio 2019 for windows but I would like to make a static build so I could avoid copying all the DLLs along with the executable.  I've changed the code generation for all the libraries and the main PDAL program to Multi-Threaded (MT) but I am still getting 74 linker errors in msvcprt.lib and also in pdal_arbiter.  Has anyone successfully made a static build and could they give me any tips to help me?


Thank You,
Hana Maquet

Yes, don't do MT, but MD, and edit CMake files to link against static curl
and other deps.
