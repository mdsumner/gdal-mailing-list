Hi

I have installed Posgres/PostGis 3.3.2 and installed PDAL. Now is 
conflict in PROJ libraries I guess, becose a I got error in PDAL 
filters.reprojection task:

ERROR 1: PROJ: proj_create_from_database: C:\Program 
Files\PostgreSQL\15\share\contrib\postgis-3.3\proj\proj.db contains

How to repair this conflict ?

Hi

I got following error

PDAL: server closed the connection unexpectedly
 ??????? This probably means the server terminated abnormally
 ??????? before or while processing the request.

Is problem in postgres server configuration ?

I am not sure that you can say this is a PROJ problem - it looks like the
versions of PostGIS and PDAL you have installed are using
different versions of PROJ and that is clashing - but PROJ is Working As
Intended in this case.

The solutions (in order of increasing simplicity) are probably :

1 - Manual work out the versions of all of the software you want to use so
that there is no version clash,
2 - Do what I would do which is - use Conda as an environment manage
<https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>r and run PDAL and PostGre
as separate Conda environments and that will avoid the version clash.

To be honest - you could also use 2) above and run them both in the same
Conda environment and Conda will still ensure that the versions it installs
do not clash.

Hi

I want to change colorization

and I use

PS C:\Users\Raivo\source\Repos\cv46srcDDdyn\ortovideo> pdal pipeline 
.\torgb.pip
PDAL: writers.gdal: Specified dimension 'Z' does not exist.

torgb.pip is as follows :
[
"44744.tiff",
{?????? "type": "filters.colorization"
},
 ???? ??? {
 ?? ???? ??? "type":"writers.gdal",
 ?? ???? ??? "resolution": 10,
 ?? ???? ??? "radius": 14.14,
 ?? ???? ??? "filename": "44744.tiff"
 ?? ???? }
]

And documentation says :

dimension

    A dimension name to use for the interpolation. [Default: ?Z?]

As I undrestand dimension 'Z' does must exist.

In what I am wrong ?

Hi

Thank You for answer, but I don't undrestand what I have to do with 
Conda. Install with conda Postgres/Postgis ?

Or what ?

If I start to change PROJ packacges how to know PROJ version

Conda is an environment manager. I sometimes wish more people understood
fully the value of environment management!

There are actually many ways an environment manager could solve what it
seems your problem is. I will quickly go through the simplest scenario. I
am sure you are more than capable of reading the documentation and working
out the tweaks and embellishments for yourself.

Assuming the simplest case from what your OP said - i.e. that
PostGre/PostGIS is currently working and that PDAL is not. In this case you
want to uninstall PDAL (or for even more safety - uninstall everything and
reinstall PostGIS from scratch ..).

Then install and run PDAL in a Conda environment - the steps for that are
as follows:

1 - Install miniconda from https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html,
2 - Read the docs about the basics of how to use it,
3 - create a new environment for running PDAL - let's call it "pdal-env" :

conda create --name pdal-env
conda activate pdal-env

4 - install PDAL by running the following in the same session as above:

conda install -c conda-forge pdal

This command will install PDAL and ALL of its dependencies into the new
environment. This includes the correct version of PROJ for the version of
PDAL. See https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdal

At this point in the session, PDAL should be working correctly.

5 - To use PDAL in the future - you need to open a Conda aware session
(i.e. command line session for whatever OS you are on) and activate the
pdal-env environment - i.e.

conda activate pdal-env

You are opening a TIFF.

That is ok so far - but TIFFs are 2D structures. They have X,Y and Band
data.

It is, of course, very common to put DEM / DTM data in TIFF files with the
Z data in the first Band (usually).

However - as per
https://pdal.io/en/latest/stages/readers.gdal.html#readers-gdal - when
loading the TIFF into PDAL you have to use the header parameter to tell
PDAL which band is mapped to which Dimension. PDAL doesn't know what kind
of Raster you are giving it.

There is no 'mode' support in writers.gdal, and having one would have some significant performance considerations.

You will need to write your own using the PDAL Python extension https://github.com/PDAL/python/ but it should be quite straightforward.
