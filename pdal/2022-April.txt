Subject: [pdal] e57 error handling
Message-ID: <DU2PR07MB80643533641AA98EEAB5CD6DC9E49@DU2PR07MB8064.eurprd07.prod.outlook.com>

Hi All.

I have a large e57 file that has multiple scans, one of which unfortunately has some "corrupt" data. This results in the checksum that e57 does failing. In pdal, the reader crashes with an uncaught E57Exception. Possibly the reader should catch and rethrow that with the context information about what failed, but that's besides the point. CloudCompare is able to import the other scans and ignores the one that failed. I'm wondering if that is the sort of behaviour that makes sense for pdal to support? I know pdal combines the scans into a single point cloud, but if a scan fails does it make sense to ignore it and keep going, or just bail out like it current does? Maybe that could be an option on the reader?

Thanks!

We would be happy to merge pull requests that implement the reasonable stuff you are suggesting here. None of the core developer team uses e57 very much either, so if someone is able to step forward to make that more usable and convenient for people, all the better.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL: vector<T> too long
Message-ID: <000f01d848a3$6f236790$4d6a36b0$@lim@gpslands.com>

Hi,

 

When I'm generating geo-tif file from las file using Json pipeline,  I've
encountered an error:

PDAL: vector<T> too long

 

The area is about 7.78 sq.km with a resolution of 0.05m.

 

When I reduced the area in "bounds", it is able to generate the tif file.

 

May I know is there any other way besides reducing the boundary area.

 

Please advise.

 

Thank you.

 

Best Regards,

 

Peter Lim

Hi,

 

Referring to my email below.

Would you consider to increase the limits for generating tif files in future
release?

 

Thank you.

You have hit a memory limit in Windows. I don't know of any way of working
around it.

Hi Andrew,

 

Thank you for your clarifications.

 

The memory of Windows 10 I?m using is huge:

 

Installed Physical Memory (RAM)             64.0 GB

Total Physical Memory  63.8 GB

Available Physical Memory          48.8 GB

Total Virtual Memory     679 GB

Available Virtual Memory             621 GB

Page File Space 615 GB

 

I?m surprised that I?ve hit the memory limit in Windows.

 

Nevertheless, would the team consider to enhance the program by internally splitting the area into smaller portions to process,

if such limits is encountered.

 

For your kind consideration.

 

Thank you.

 

Best Regards,

 

Peter Lim

Hi,

I don?t work much with pdal but tiffs generally need to be created with a BIG tiff switch. If pdal uses gdal to create the tiff, you may need to force the big tiff format with a switch for file with more than 4GB.

No. Map and reduce are the responsibility of PDAL users, not PDAL itself. The reason for this is because you know your data, and many of the guesses PDAL might make in determining how to split up your data for a given task are going to be wrong. Some pipelines might take lots of memory. Some might take a long time. 

PDAL is not a workflow engine for processing point cloud data. It is a library *for making* point cloud processing workflow engines.
