Hello Eran,
Another possibility is to create DEM files from the LIDAR data, then use
GDALDEM to create hillshaded tiles. I'm not exactly clear how to create the
DEM files however...

One you have DEM files, I wrote a tool that can create a seamless
hillshaded layer for GeoServer, then it is served up to OpenLayers the
usual way via GeoServer.

Here is the result:

Roger and Eran,

To create a DEM from Pointcloud data using PDAL, you can use the Points2Grid driver. Here?s an example pipeline. You might also want add a filter to select just the last return or the Bare Earth classification if your data is classified.

For pdal, first create an ascii grid file from (las/pgpointcloud/whatever) using pdal. Then convert to tif via gdal_translate. Then use gdaldem to create the hillshade and color-relief images.

pdal pipeline point2gridpipe.xml
gdal_translate -a_srs epsg:3857 points2grid.asc points2grid.tif
gdaldem hillshade points2grid.tif points2grid_hs.tif -z 5 -az 90
gdaldem color-relief points2grid.tif colorramp.txt points2grid_cr.tif -co compress=jpeg -co PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR -co tiled=yes

Example pipeline:

<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Pipeline version="1.0">
  <Writer type="drivers.p2g.writer">
    <Option name="filename?>points2grid</Option>
    <Option name="grid_dist_x">1</Option>
    <Option name="grid_dist_y">1</Option>
    <Option name="output_type">idw</Option>
    <Option name="output_format">asc</Option>
    <Filter type="filters.selector">
      <Option name="ignore_default">true</Option>
      <Option name="keep">
        <Options>
          <Option name="dimension">X</Option>
          <Option name="dimension">Y</Option>
          <Option name="dimension">Z</Option>
        </Options>
      </Option>
      <Filter type="filters.inplacereprojection">
        <Option name="out_srs">EPSG:3857</Option>
        <Option name="scale_x">1e-05</Option>
        <Option name="scale_z">1e-05</Option>
        <Option name="scale_y">1e-05</Option>

          <Option name="filename">pointcloudfile.laz</Option>
        </Reader>
      </Filter>
    </Filter>

Eran-

The sheer volume of point cloud data, as Howard says, makes it very hard to
display in a traditional web browser system, e.g. OpenLayers fed by JSON.
You'll need to find a way to reduce the point count in a smart way - like
feeding out a LOD (level of detail) algorithm.

Two or three years ago, people started looking for good ways to do this.
There might be an open source solution by now, but it would require
something more heavyweight than just OpenLayers.

Hi there ,

Can anyone point me to an example how to implement PDAL with OpenLayers ?

I have LAS file and PostGIS db with points in them.

Want to try PDAL.


OpenLayers is a web JavaScript technology. PDAL is a data translation
software focused on transformations from one format to another. You could
try using PDAL to export point cloud data to GeoJSON (using
drivers.text.writer) and importing that into an OpenLayers map in some way.
You are very likely to overwhelm any browser, however, with any significant
amount of point cloud data.

Thanks Michael!
I didn't even know this existed! Awesome. So, back to the original
question, it should be therefore possible to put together a simple
OpenLayers hillshade or colormap visualizer for a pgPointCloud database
using the chain you suggest and display directly in OpenLayers. Then you
wouldn't even need GeoServer. It might be kind of slow however.

The way I would do this is:

In OpenLayers, set up a WMS layer that calls a special tile URL handler on
your server.

On the server, respond to the tile request by outputting the tile area from
a pgPointCloud database directly into a DEM using pdal pipeline
mypipelinefile.xml
then do the rest as you suggest.
gdal_translate -a_srs epsg:3857 points2grid.asc points2grid.tif
gdaldem hillshade points2grid.tif points2grid_hs.tif -z 5 -az 90


Return the tile response to OpenLayers as a jpeg or png.

Roger,

Note that Points2Grid is a separate compile option in PDAL, although it is easy to compile in option. It uses CMAKE for building. The repo for the code is here  https://github.com/CRREL/points2grid

Thanks Michael!
I didn't even know this existed! Awesome. So, back to the original question, it should be therefore possible to put together a simple OpenLayers hillshade or colormap visualizer for a pgPointCloud database using the chain you suggest and display directly in OpenLayers. Then you wouldn't even need GeoServer. It might be kind of slow however.

The way I would do this is:

In OpenLayers, set up a WMS layer that calls a special tile URL handler on your server.

On the server, respond to the tile request by outputting the tile area from a pgPointCloud database directly into a DEM using pdal pipeline mypipelinefile.xml
then do the rest as you suggest.
gdal_translate -a_srs epsg:3857 points2grid.asc points2grid.tif
gdaldem hillshade points2grid.tif points2grid_hs.tif -z 5 -az 90


Return the tile response to OpenLayers as a jpeg or png.

Roger and Eran,

To create a DEM from Pointcloud data using PDAL, you can use the Points2Grid driver. Here?s an example pipeline. You might also want add a filter to select just the last return or the Bare Earth classification if your data is classified.

For pdal, first create an ascii grid file from (las/pgpointcloud/whatever) using pdal. Then convert to tif via gdal_translate. Then use gdaldem to create the hillshade and color-relief images.

pdal pipeline point2gridpipe.xml
gdal_translate -a_srs epsg:3857 points2grid.asc points2grid.tif
gdaldem hillshade points2grid.tif points2grid_hs.tif -z 5 -az 90
gdaldem color-relief points2grid.tif colorramp.txt points2grid_cr.tif -co compress=jpeg -co PHOTOMETRIC=YCBCR -co tiled=yes

Hello Eran,
Another possibility is to create DEM files from the LIDAR data, then use GDALDEM to create hillshaded tiles. I'm not exactly clear how to create the DEM files however...

One you have DEM files, I wrote a tool that can create a seamless hillshaded layer for GeoServer, then it is served up to OpenLayers the usual way via GeoServer.

http://rasternormalizer.codeplex.com/

Here is the result:

The sheer volume of point cloud data, as Howard says, makes it very hard to
display in a traditional web browser system, e.g. OpenLayers fed by JSON.
You'll need to find a way to reduce the point count in a smart way - like
feeding out a LOD (level of detail) algorithm.

Two or three years ago, people started looking for good ways to do this.
There might be an open source solution by now, but it would require
something more heavyweight than just OpenLayers.

Hi there ,

Can anyone point me to an example how to implement PDAL with OpenLayers ?

I have LAS file and PostGIS db with points in them.

Want to try PDAL.


OpenLayers is a web JavaScript technology. PDAL is a data translation
software focused on transformations from one format to another. You could
try using PDAL to export point cloud data to GeoJSON (using
drivers.text.writer) and importing that into an OpenLayers map in some way.
You are very likely to overwhelm any browser, however, with any significant
amount of point cloud data.

Note that points2grid came from the OpenTopography project, and CRREL's repository is one where we've cleaned things up a little bit and made it easy to integrate into PDAL.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL moving from http://pointcloud.org to http://pdal.io
Message-ID: <71CE35DE-0322-4ACF-A618-EDD2C208268E@hobu.co>

All,

I am in the process of moving the website to http://pdal.io  Having our website at http://pointcloud.org causes confusion with PCL which is at http://pointclouds.org, and I think the new URL fits our identity better. Because most are on holiday(s) this week, so it was a good time to make such a change.

The website is also now hosted on github pages, and any current PDAL developer can clone the repository and push new changes to it if they wish. I would note, however, that the entire tree is going to continue to be built and pushed to https://github.com/PDAL/pdal.github.io every three hours, so don't make changes to the generated website and expect them to stick. Instead, make changes to the documentation at https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/tree/master/doc in the main PDAL tree.

Thanks,

Howard
