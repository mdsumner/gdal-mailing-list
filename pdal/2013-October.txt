Hi,

I am also getting and error when building PDAL (in CentOS 6.4 in my case). The message is:

Hi Oscar,

I hit this yesterday.  If you install flann and flann-devel packages and 
rerun your cmake that should fix you.  There's conditional (on flann) 
code in the .hpp but it's not conditional in the dot.cpp.

Take care,
Dave

potentially interesting thread on Boost-users

Subject: [Boost-users] [interprocess] Reading huge files
To: boost-users at lists.boost.org


Dear all,

I am new to boost memory mapping, so this question might look simplistic.

I need to read huge amounts of data (for instance, a 20GB file), and
since memory mapping is quite fast, I was going to use it. However, I
don't know what it would be faster when, due to memory constraints, I
need to partition the file into regions. Moreover, I should treat the
file as a string (I need to perform string operations).

What I'm trying now is just to read the entire file:

    boost::interprocess::file_mapping mmap(input_filename.c_str(),
boost::interprocess::read_only);
    boost::interprocess::mapped_region map(mmap,
boost::interprocess::read_only);

    std::size_t l = map.get_size(), tot_read = 0;

    void *ptr = map.get_address();

    while (tot_read < l)
    {
        register std::size_t x = std::min(l - tot_read,
static_cast<std::size_t>(prealloc));

        std::copy_n(static_cast<char*>(ptr) + tot_read, x, line.begin());

        // Do something here...

        tot_read += x;
    }


So, when the file is huge, do I need to create a mapped_region inside
the loop? I didn't see anywhere in the documentation the possibility
to move the mapped region.

Another side-question, if you don't mind. I'm not sure that what I'm
doing is efficient, especially the need to copy from the region to a
string. If you have suggestions, I'm more than happy to hear these.


Thanks & Cheers!

Subject: [pdal] Application reorganization and Vagrant configuration
Message-ID: <BA9B0C44-89CA-4FF2-9E47-521F484D2165@hobu.co>

All,

I have taken the liberty to collapse pcpipeline, pc2pc, pcinfo, and pcquery into a git-style application -- pdal. I've found myself adding more capabilities and miniature applications, and it seemed silly to keep proliferating new application names with all of the requisite machinery required to do so. Also, this reorganization brings the application-focused stuff into pdal::kernel, much like the application kernel that existed in libLAS once upon a time. Thanks to the work Michael Gerlek has done, however, PDAL's is much more powerful. This approach means that developers can take advantage of the application logic in their own software without jumping out to a command line application if they wanted to.

The second recent development is that I have created a Vagrant configuration for PDAL. Vagrant is configuration management for VirtualBox, and you can use it to create a simple virtual machine that is fully outfitted with a working PDAL environment. There are scripts added in the scripts/vagrant directory in addition to the Vagrantfile configuration. Usage of this new tool is as simple as:

~/dev/pdal $ vagrant up
...
...
...
~/dev/pdal $ vagrant ssh
~/dev/pdal $ vagrant halt
~/dev/pdal $ vagrant destroy

The configuration is a 64bit Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, with the addition of some PPAs for boost 1.53 and GIS software. Everything is installed into /usr except for PDAL, which is installed in /usr/local 

Both of these changes are in the master branch as of this afternoon.

Thanks,

Howard

Message-ID: <CAFcOn29sdAxrEEQ5TyXZrTjdSTKa6jxs6dA8Oy+vnO759JKkSg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Paul and Howard

We still have issues with compiling PDAL with LAS reader and pointcloud
writer support.
We're usng PostgreSQL 9.1 which is the newest version under Ubuntu.

Then LAS reader worked but pdal does'nt find pointcloud writer.

We compiled PDAL from github with default cmake and wondered
=> why there is a mandatory dependency on Oracle libraries?

Then I saw in PDAL the pramsey-config.sh file and this blog entry with
ccmake instructions [1].
=> What's the difference between the to (I fear the blog installs PDAL in
another directory)?
=> Why is pointcloud not part of the default config (like Oracle)?

Hello,

We are having issues building PDAL on Ubuntu 13.10, following the guide on [1].

Initially, PDAL successfully compiles with using the ?cmake ?G ?Unix Makefiles? ../? command. However, when trying to import a sample .LAS file into PostgreSQL 9.1 using the PDAL Pipeline application. The following error occurred ?Caught PDAL exception: Unable to create writer for type ?drivers.pgpointcloud.writer?.?.

Our next approach was to use the script ?pramsey-config.sh? from github and was thrown the following errors:


1.       In file included from /usr/include/gdal/cpl_conv.h:34:0,

** We had adapted the path for the dependencies to our system in the script.

Would greatly appreciate if someone could advise on how to proceed.

Thank you.

Subject: [pdal] Loading several LAS files
Message-ID: <kud6cvlqpqremkbufcqt4wl7.1383120768723@email.android.com>


Hi,

I am trying to load several LAS files into Postgres PointCloud using the PDAL pcpipeline.

First I add the format in the table pointcloud_formats, basically I only have X, Y and Z, and the pcid is 1

Then I create a table:

CREATE TABLE patches (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    pa PCPATCH(1)
);

And then I run a pcpipeline for each LAS file with the following XML (changing [input File] in each case)

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <Pipeline version="1.0">
        <Writer type="drivers.pgpointcloud.writer">
            <Option name="connection">host='localhost' dbname='testload' </Option>
            <Option name="table">patches</Option>
            <Option name="srid">7415</Option>
            <Filter type="filters.chipper">
                <Option name="capacity">400</Option>
                <Filter type="filters.cache">
                    <Option name="max_cache_blocks">1</Option>
                    <Reader type="drivers.las.reader">
                        <Option name="filename">[inputFile]</Option>
                        <Option name="spatialreference">EPSG:7415</Option>
                    </Reader>
                </Filter>
            </Filter>
        </Writer>
    </Pipeline>

I realized that each pcpipeline execution overwrites the patches table, so in the end it is like I only loaded the last LAS file. I have tried to use the option overwrite=false but it seems to be ignored. Also when I try to use a table name different than "patches" it is also ignored. And I also realized that pcpipiline also adds a format in the table pointcloud_formats and use this when overwriting the patches table. Also using the option pcid in the XML is ignored.

Is anybody else having issues when trying to load several LAS files?

Thank you

Oscar
