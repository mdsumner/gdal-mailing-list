Hi Mike,

I have some questions on how to get the X,Y,Z value from the PDAL, I saw
last time you sent me code like this:

Schema schema = reader.getSchema();

SchemaLayout layout = new SchemaLayout(schema);

PointBuffer data = new PointBuffer(layout, 128);

// get the dimensions (fields) of the point record for the X, Y, and Z
values

int offsetX = schema.getDimensionIndex(Dimension.Field.Field_X,
Dimension.DataType.Int32);

int offsetY = schema.getDimensionIndex(Dimension.Field.Field_Y,
Dimension.DataType.Int32);

int offsetZ = schema.getDimensionIndex(Dimension.Field.Field_Z,
Dimension.DataType.Int32);

Dimension dimensionX = schema.getDimension((uint)offsetX);

Dimension dimensionY = schema.getDimension((uint)offsetY);

Dimension dimensionZ = schema.getDimension((uint)offsetZ);

You were using the Dimension, would you please let me know how can I get the
X,Y,Z value of each point?
Is there a LasPoint structure in the PDAL?
 Is the PointBuffer can be used for loading all the points into memory at
one time?

Michael,

I was testing out compiling PDAL with clang and it throws a number of cast alignment warnings related to our templated getField calls:

 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2741787/warning-cast-increases-required-alignment has something to say about this, but the memcpy has the potential to be a performance killer unless the implementation is smart in some way. These alignment issues would be real if we were to move to a Power7 or something (not outside the realm of possibility for this kind of software/problem domain).  What should we do?

The general problem is we've got an array of bytes from which we're extracting out an int, and there's no assurance that the int happens to be 4-byte aligned.

The Right Thing To Do would be to make sure that our schemas get constructed with proper alignment.  That is, every time we append a Dimension to the schema, we add the needed padding to make sure each type lies on its natural boundary -- and when we allocate a PointBuffer it should be aligned to the largest such boundary.

(And even then, I'm not sure how to tell the compiler that we know we're safe in these cases, short of a #pragma.)

On the x86, of course, it doesn't matter, so I'd prefer not to worry about it.  But on the other hand I'm very fussy about stomping compiler warnings too...

If you look at the example code (TestLasReader.cs) off the latest git, you'll see I have code that does exactly what you want - it extracts out the X,Y,Z fields and then (un)scales them appropriately.

 

[Note too that the latest version of pdal doesn't use SchemaLayouts anymore.]

It says it couldn't find swig. Do you have swig in your path?

You can ignore those warnings probably for now.

 

After you build pdal itself (PDAL.sln), you then build the SWIG bindings (csharp/pdal_swig.sln).  As part of that build process, those .cs files are all automatically generated - they serve as stubs for the real C++ classes.

Hi Mike,

 

Eventually I successfully run the mpg-config.bat by many tries last night and after I restarted my computer this morning. However, I got some warning like this:

CMake Warning:

 

  Manually-specified variables were not used by the project:

    ICONV_LIBRARY

    LIBLAS_INCLUDE_DIR

 

I am going to compile the project, but I found a lot of files are missing:

I tried to search all the places, I found some of them, but some(like Bounds_double.cs) are still missing, do you have some idea of this?

You need to have libxml2 installed (you can get this as part of OSGeo4W) and modify the config.bat file accordingly.

Hi Mike,

 

I open the PDAL.sln and hit ALL_BUILD however, I found errors:

Hi Mike,

I built the PDAL.sln and there was an error:
Error 2 error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'GL/freeglut.h': No such file
or directory C:\dev\PDAL\apps\pcview\Engine.cpp 48 1 pcview
and I found that pdal.dll were generated. however, I still couldn't compile
pdal-swig.sln because missing the files that I mentioned last time.
Would you please give me comments?

Looks like you're trying to build the pcview app - do you have the cmake option for freeglut turned off?

 

If you've got pdal.dll, do the unit tests pass?

Hi Mike,

In the PDAL.sln, I had successfully built the ALL_BUILD project with no
error, and I built pdal_test with no error, but I didn't build RUN_TEST
successfully, the errors are:

Error 1 error MSB3073: The command "setlocal
"C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin\ctest.exe" --force-new-ctest-process
-C Debug
if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto :cmEnd
:cmEnd
endlocal & call :cmErrorLevel %errorlevel% & goto :cmDone
:cmErrorLevel
exit /b %1
:cmDone
if %errorlevel% neq 0 goto :VCEnd
:VCEnd" exited with code 8. C:\Program Files
(x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets 113 6 RUN_TESTS

and I still didn't get the pdal_swig.sln build successfully because the
missing file in the pdal_swig_cs project, can we schedule a time for the
problem solving?

Try setting the Start Project to pdal_test directly, don't use the cmake testing tool - that's how I do it.

Hi Mike,

 

In the PDAL.sln, I had successfully built the ALL_BUILD project with no error, and I built pdal_test with no error, but I didn't build RUN_TEST successfully, the errors are:

 

Error    1          error MSB3073: The command "setlocal

"C:\Program Files (x86)\CMake 2.8\bin\ctest.exe" --force-new-ctest-process -C Debug

and I still didn't get the pdal_swig.sln build successfully because the missing file in the pdal_swig_cs project, can we schedule a time for the problem solving?

You can ignore those warnings probably for now.

 

After you build pdal itself (PDAL.sln), you then build the SWIG bindings (csharp/pdal_swig.sln).  As part of that build process, those .cs files are all automatically generated - they serve as stubs for the real C++ classes.

Hi Mike,

 

Eventually I successfully run the mpg-config.bat by many tries last night and after I restarted my computer this morning. However, I got some warning like this:

CMake Warning:

I tried to search all the places, I found some of them, but some(like Bounds_double.cs) are still missing, do you have some idea of this?

Hi Mike,

this is some information from the output of building of pdal_test project:

2>------ Rebuild All started: Project: pdal, Configuration: Debug Win32
------
2>  Building Custom Rule C:/dev/PDAL/src/CMakeLists.txt

How can I configure building without using of cmake testing tool?

All,

I have committed a patch to PDAL to do provide debug logging output.  We previously had the switches in place, but not the actual logging mechanism.  Here is a short summary of how it works:

- StageBase has an implemented virtual log(std::ostringstream& input) (and another method that takes in a std::string and forwards it for you) that issues the logging operation
- At initialize() time, a log is opened using the "log" option of the stage. For "stdlog" (std::clog), "stdout", (std::cout), and "stderr" (std::cerr) options, these are simply initialized to be the streams for these standard outputs.
  * For "log" options that were specified as a file, the log file is opened as an ostream *only* if the stage has no inputs -- i.e. it is a Reader.  All other stages ask down the pipeline to getLogger(), which just forwards the pointer to the ostream.
  * What should we do for MultiFilters?
  * if isDebug is not true for the stage, no debug info is output for that specific stage.  We may want some sort of "globalDebug" option to turn isDebug on for every stage.

I initially was going to let stages themselves worry about verbosity and isDebug, but now that I write this email, I see that's not such a good way to go.  Expect the the method to change to log(std::ostringstream& input, int nVerbosity), and it will make sure to test the stage's isDebug before actually writing data to the log.  This way we don't have to litter the stage(s) with isDebug tests.

I'm not quite sure I understand the last paragraph...  Will I be able to tell the reprojector to log very verbosely, but the stages before and after it to be relatively quiet?

As for the MultiFilter: if merging two datasets wasn't such a common operation, I'd never have written that cursed filter...  Perhaps you could take the average of all the inputs :-)

Subject: [pdal] build errors on head (win32)
Message-ID: <070f01cc94d4$928c7d40$b7a577c0$@flaxen.com>

The OCI stuff isn't building under win32 right now, for two reasons:

* Cloud:: Cloud() and Cloud::~ Cloud() are declared and used, but not defined

* the new "bind" code totally fails to compile under win32 with boost 1.46.1 (lines 67 and 71 in oci Reader.cpp, and two more in the Writer), see below

I've locally commented out those 4 bind lines and stubbed in empty definitions for Cloud() and ~Cloud(), and everything builds and passes okay.
