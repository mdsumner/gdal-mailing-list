Subject: [pdal] Master not compiling in Visual Studio
Message-ID: <44A10BB04DB1CF4CB221604BDFC6C0CC3F653475@NBSVR-MAIL01.radiantblue.local>

Hey everyone,

My name is Whitney.  I worked with Brad Chambers a little bit on some PCL stuff a few months ago which was tangentially related to PDAL.  I'm currently working on creating a Geowave reader and writer for PDAL.  I had been working off of a slightly older branch, but yesterday I finally rebased with master.

Anyway, I'm emailing the list because the latest code in master doesn't build in Visual Studio.  I included a list of the issues I encountered and my workarounds.

Issues:

  *   MetadataNodeImpl - 2 components to this issue
     *   Issue 1: In the sanitize method, this style of initialization is not supported in Visual C++
std::vector<std::string> to_replace = {";", ":", " ", "'", "\""};
     *   Issue 2: For some reason, Visual C++ is not happy about moving the private constructor for MetadataNodeImpl to Metadata.cpp

Fix: Fixed both issues by removing the sanitize method, moving the constructor back to the header the way it originally was, and adding a one-line sanitize method in the constructor after initialization:
std::replace_if(m_name.begin(), m_name.end(), boost::is_any_of(";: '\""), '_');

  *   PointBufferTest.cpp - 2 issues
     *   Issue 1: Visual C++ wants a const declaration for NUM_PTS

Fix: const point_count_t NUM_PTS = 1000000;
     *   Issue 2: random() is seemingly not available in Visual C++

Fix: rand() works as a replacement

  *   BpfReader.[hpp,cpp]
     *   Visual C++ is not happy about Charbuf being used in BpfReader.hpp.
     *   Only complains when trying to link seekoff and seekpos into BPFTest.
     *   If the Charbuf variable is removed from BpfReader.hpp, and relocated to BpfReader.cpp, the error goes away.
     *   This issue has really stumped me.  I don't have a good solution...

These fixes work for me at the moment, but if you guys have a better way of resolving the issues, I'll be happy to pick up your changes the next time I rebase.  I should also point out that I haven't taken the time to make sure my fixes work in Linux.

If you have any questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Whitney O'Meara

I just rebased to grab yesterday's commits to master.  It looks like the build is still broken, although the issues seem to have changed.

Just giving you guys a heads up.
