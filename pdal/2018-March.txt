All,


Pete Gadomski put together an excellent blog post about how he's using
PDAL to measure snow depths in the Rocky Mountains. It has some nice
examples of advanced things you can do with PDAL you might find
interesting. Great job, Pete!

Subject: [pdal] filters.smrf question
Message-ID: <CAFHs+SOoFWB9DBVHeyz0=dJh0nJcmO4E_Jigv8mBF-=GrJYQjw@mail.gmail.com>

 I'm fairly new to pdal but i'm trying to write a pipeline to utilize the
filters.smrf in order to classify ground as well as keep unclassified
points or better yet keep the points not reclassified in their original
classifications.  The pipeline i found creates a beautifully dense ground
surface but there must be a way to keep other classifications that weren't
determined to be ground right?  The majority of the points i'm trying to
"search" to determine if they are ground are in the unclassified class (7)
so i can't use the ignore function right?

the pipeline is used is:

* {*
*  "pipeline":[*
*    "528000_5392000_1000.las",*
*    {*
*      "type":"filters.smrf"*
*    },*
*    {*
*      "type":"filters.range",*
*      "limits":"Classification[2:2]"*
*    },*
*    "output.las"*
*  ]*
*}*


Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

If you want to keep the non-ground points, just remove the range filter.

If you want to keep the original classifications as well as the smrf'd
ones, you can copy them to another dimension before running smrf:

*{*
*  "pipeline":[*
*    "528000_5392000_1000.las",*
*    {*
*      "type":"filters.ferry",*
*      "dimensions":"Classification=OldClassification"*
*    },*
*    {*
*      "type":"filters.smrf"*
*    },*
*    {*
*      "type":"filters.range",*
*      "limits":"Classification[2:2]"*
*    },*
*    "output.las"*
*  ]*
*}*


Note, that there is no standard place in a LAS file for
"OldClassification", so you'll have to add it as extra bytes or use some
other output format.

Subject: [pdal] Difference?
Message-ID: <e49a5bc831dd4fd69b2e73ceeb7e4cf6@ROCXCH17.cs.myharris.net>

Hey All,

Trying to understand the difference between two PDAL commands.  The first is a translate command.  The second is a streaming pipeline command with the pipeline parameters passed in over standard in.

Using PDAL 1.5.0.

Translate command:
/usr/local/pdal/bin/pdal
  translate
  -i /tmp/b.las
  -o /tmp/b_trans.las
  --writer=las
  -f filters.reprojection
  --filters.reprojection.out_srs=+proj=utm +zone=13 +north +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m  +no_defs
  --writers.las.scale_x=0.01
  --writers.las.scale_y=0.01
  --writers.las.scale_z=0.01
  --writers.las.offset_x=auto
  --writers.las.offset_y=auto
  --writers.las.offset_z=auto
  --writers.las.forward=header
  --writers.las.minor_version=2

Streaming pipeline command:
/usr/local/pdal/bin/pdal
  pipeline
  --stdin
  --stream
  --readers.las.filename=/tmp/b.las
  --writers.las.filename=/tmp/b_pipeline.las

Pipeline sent in over stdin:
{
  "pipeline":[
    {
     "type":"readers.las"
    },
    {
      "type":"filters.reprojection",
      "out_srs":"+proj=utm +zone=13 +north +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m  +no_defs"
    },
   {
      "type":"writers.las",
      "scale_x":"0.01",
      "scale_y":"0.01",
      "scale_z":"0.01",
     "offset_x":"auto",
     "offset_y":"auto",
     "offset_z":"auto",
     "forward":"header",
     "minor_version":"2"
  }
]
}

Can someone help me understand the differences between the commands because the two commands are producing different outputs?  There's a difference in the projection info and the offsets are minimums in the translate command and 0 in the pipeline command.

Thanks,

Mike

I can't recreate with version 1.6.  For my input file, the output files are
identical.

The SRS in your translate example needs quotes around it, though that may
just be an issue with the posting of the note.
