Hi again,

This is just a test of the mailing list, and also a test of the mailing list archiving that hadn't seemed to keep working through the list renaming.

Michael (and others who wish to chime in),

I'd like to move the PDAL repository to github.  It's all the rage, yada yada, but the major impetus is to offload user management.  Bitbucket is Mercurial-based, but I've had trouble with downtime with it, and github is rocking the house.  Note that I don't know squat about git, and i'll be learning it as I go, but it is similar to hg in many concepts and ideas (and more powerful too -- at a usability cost).

What do you think?

Another option would be hg on Google Code

Yes, I forgot about hg on Google Code too, but it doesn't support the ideas of harmless forking and push/pull changeset requests.  github would others that aren't so connected with our community to participate at a coding level in a way that hg on BitBucket, Google Code, or hosted by ourselves can't support.

I'm -0 on this, just because I don't want to have to learn something new...
