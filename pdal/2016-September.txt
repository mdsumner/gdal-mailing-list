Message-ID: <CAL_c7md_iPSPaXgQQBSgtSkfB3p43LUadZv=jZfFSbm925Z1+g@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

This is a follow-up to a question posted over at GIS Stack Exchange (
http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/175454/are-pdal-or-pcl-capable-of-producing-lidar-grid-metrics).
I'm curious what functionality or approach one would take with PDAL to
calculate Lidar grid metrics?

FUSION is currently the best available set of tools that I know of for
calculating Lidar grid metrics, which are useful for describing forest
structure (http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion/fusionlatest.html). From
the FUSION documentation (page 70 from the documentation
http://forsys.cfr.washington.edu/fusion/FUSION_manual.pdf):

GridMetrics computes a series of descriptive statistics for a LIDAR data
set. Output is a raster (grid) represented in database form with each
record corresponding to a single grid cell.

Essentially, I'm interested in producing a raster dataset where each cell
represents summarized descriptive statistics for the Lidar point cloud such
as cover, skewness, 75th percentile, etc (all of the grid metrics I'm after
are available on the FUSION documentation. Is this currently possible, or
recommended, with PDAL, or would this require other libraries? Many thanks
in advance.

Best Regards,

-Aaron

Hey,
I do something similar with pgpointcloud.
I grou points by patch that are cells in a grid,
then I compute statistics about each patch.
Cheers,

Aaron,

This is absolutely possible; it just doesn't exist out of the box today. We
do something similar in our DerivativeWriter today (
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/blob/master/io/derivative/DerivativeWriter.cpp).
That may be a good place to look for inspiration. I think in the end you
are looking for a GridMetricsWriter though. Are you needing a full
replacement of the FUSION function? Or just a few select metrics?

As I mentioned in the Stack Exchange thread, and Brad mentioned below, this isn't currently possible out of the box with PDAL. I would ask what you are hoping to get by having this capability in PDAL rather than building a tool chain that includes FUSION + PDAL + other tools. Maybe it would be helpful to take a step back and describe how PDAL statistics computation would fit within a larger context.

Most of PDAL's current "characterization" filters are about generating primitive computations for algorithms such as slope, ground, etc. There's things like coplanarity, projection, regression, sampling, and normal computation [1]. These are "per-point" type statistics rather than summaries, however, and are focused on the positional geometry of the point in relation(s) to its neighbors. Brad described the derivative writer, which does some typical surface summaries, and it would be a good place to start on an implementation if you were sufficiently motivated.

PDAL's statistics filter [2] was recently updated to add kurtosis, skewness, variance, etc (no percentiles). You *might* be able to use that in combination with some sort moving window bounding geometry along with the crop filter [3], but this would be quite laborious and probably quite slow. Rémi's pgpointcloud approach seems viable and might be useful for other reasons, depending on what you want to do.

So, plenty of options but nothing that just does it.

this is what r.in.lidar in GRASS GIS is doing:

https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.in.lidar.html
method: n, min, max, range, sum, mean, stddev, variance, coeff_var, median,
percentile, skewness, trimmean
(available also through QGIS processing since Jun 2)

Currently, r.in.lidar is using libLAS. I would like to rewrite it (or would
like somebody else to rewrite it) to use PDAL instead of libLAS.

The idea here is that at the end you have your data in GRASS GIS where you
can do the subsequent raster analysis (although you can of course import or
link the raster created elsewhere) but PDAL (or currently only libLAS) is
used for all point cloud processing in the background. This is something
like a tool chain which Howard mentions but hidden from the user.

(If somebody is interested in working towards that, please let me know
anytime.)

Believe he is trying to move entirely to Linux and is looking for a FUSION
metrics replacement since it does not run in Linux. SPDLib looks
interesting. If you have access to LAStools the LAScanopy tool does these
metrics, although I am unsure if the free version has full functionality.

Aaron,
You can do most of this in GRASS GIS 7.2svn using r.in.lidar to create
individual rasters for each metric.
https://grass.osgeo.org/grass72/manuals/r.in.lidar.html .  It corrects the
z values to height above ground when you designate a base raster DEM and
you can give it a text list of las/laz files to process as a single unit.
I'm using it to process county-wide QL2 density in North Carolina for
canopy metrics and have processed data in 10billion point blacks at a time.

I find canopy cover to be a somewhat subjective metric , based on bare
earth points, which varies depending on the method used to extract bare
earth points.

Is it not possible to run FUSION in Wine (which is the way most end up running LAStools in Linux too)?

Forgot about Wine (haven`t had to use it in ages), of course it should run
that way. Apologies.

Hi,


Is there a way to add a color source of type TMS to plasio-ui after it has
been created using plasio_ui.core.createUI?


Thanks,

Subject: [pdal] Building PDAL 1.3 on Debian testing
Message-ID: <CAEMWU28sAkj1UmR3=B5gmRa2WgqrZj27MaCYxYB7w8ZcsHQNwA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I know I can use Docker ;) but I am learning how to build applications from
source. I saw that there was a PDAL 1.2 package for Debian testing but it
is not built with PCL so it does not have the ground filter that I need. As
an aside, if I install the PCL package before the PDAL package, will it
then be linked? I do not think so, believe it has to be packaged with the
support built in.

I followed the instructions on the PDAL website (after installing the PCL
(and others) package and I can access the PDAL command line eg. --version
returns 1.3 and --drivers shows that the filter.ground is available.
However there are some errors at the top of the display such as:

(PDAL Error: 0): Can't load library
/opt/source/pdal-trunk/build/bin/../lib/libpdal_plugin_filter_gridprojection.so:
Failed to load

The are two other filters that have these errors when I invoke PDAL

libpdal_plugin_filter_greedyprojection.so
libpdal_plugin_filter_poisson.so

I assume I missed a dependency somewhere or something similar. I even
sourced the paths before running PDAL with the following

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/opt/source/pdal-trunk/build/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
export PATH="/opt/source/pdal-trunk/build/bin:$PATH"

but I get the same errors.

This is on Debian stretch 64-bit.

Thanks for any illumination you can provide as to what package I forgot.

I do not think these errors are blocking (I do not need those specific
functions) but am worried something else might be broken under the hood.

Regards,
JF Prieur

We ran into these issues when PCL was not built with the same compiler as PDAL, and I think they were related to clang 3.8. We were either able to back up to clang 3.6 or use the latest gcc to get over the issue.

Also, the scripts/docker/Dockerfile and scripts/docker/dependencies/Dockerfile provide the exact recipe for how we are building on Xenial. Even if you don't like our containers, you can use them as a guide

Thanks again for the quick reply Howard, not that I do not like the
containers, use them all the time! I just remembered something from the
Cmake screens, it could not find the PCLAPPS directory location but they
are installed, perhaps related.

Thanks for the knowledge, I will try to build PCL from source and then PDAL
(I know there are so many other variables so no guarantees). Will have a
look at the docker scripts for future reference.

JF

FWIW, the pdal package in Debian disabled the PCL plugin in pdal
(1.1.0-5) because that pulls VTK into the dependency chain, and the VTK
packages in Debian are not very well maintained.

Having the VTK packages in the dependency chain makes the package very
prone to release critical bugs which threaten the removal of the package
from testing and subsequently from the next stable release.

GRASS will soon depend on PDAL and this package is too important to not
have in a Debian stable release.

Kind Regards,

Bas

Brad Chambers has ported nearly all of the interesting filters that were PCL-based into PDAL proper at PDAL 1.3.0, so there won't be a lot of functionality drop-off by not having PCL available.

The biggest missing item of missing PCL would be PCD read/write support.

That's great news!

The GRASS developers also mentioned the lack of the ground filter in the
Debian PDAL packages, so it would seem the 1.3.0 packages would suit
their needs too.

Speaking of 1.3.0, the PDAL 1.3.0 packages should migrate to testing
tomorrow.

Kind Regards,

Bas

I just upgraded to Debian testing, the PDAL installed is now 1.3.0 but no
filter.ground in the --drivers listing. There is the new filters.mongus
which I will try however.

Apologies for the spam, I saw there is a filter.pmf which is obviously what
I am looking for.

Yes, filters.pmf is the filters.ground replacement. I'd be happy to hear
feedback on filters.mongus and filters.smrf, which are both ground
segmentation alternatives. Both should be treated as alpha implementations
however.

Charles-Éric,

It might be best for the plasio stuff to post these kinds of queries on tickets for now to get the quickest response. I'm not positive, but I think the answer is no. I presume you want this so you can allow a user to paste in their own TMS URL?

Thanks for your response Howard. That's exactly what I want to achieve. I
opened a ticket here https://github.com/hobu/plasio-ui/issues/4 so we can
continue the discussion.

Hi,

I’d like to link PCL to PDAL. Reading through the documentation its hard to tell if this can be done using binaries or needs to be compiled from source. Thanks in advance for any guidance.

You can use the pcl package (libpcl-dev), it was used by the pdal
package before, but as discussed previously [0] having vtk in the
dependency chain gets the pdal package to be affected by too many
release critical bugs in vtk.

After installing the libpcl-dev package and its dependencies, you need
to build PDAL with -DBUILD_PLUGIN_PCL=ON.

With the changes in PDAL 1.3.0, the added value of the PCL plugin is
limited.

Bas,

Thanks for your reply. Perusing PCL plugins <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/tree/master/plugins/pcl> on the github seems to be the pay to know what has been migrated from PCL. Is that true? I’m interested in the RANSAC tools. 

Is PCL linked in the Docker image? 

Thank you!

Thanks Andrew,

I’d love to be able to create a genuine non-docker digital ocean droplet (or AWS) based on the PDAL docker. Anyone have experience/advice to share in this regard?

Thanks,
Peter
