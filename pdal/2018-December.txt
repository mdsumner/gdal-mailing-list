Subject: [pdal] Workaround for current Conda issues on Windows
Message-ID: <CAJyqqPxAmWPy+_CosiAq3rD2eZmB29o4H+7D18gCf6HwW_6G6A@mail.gmail.com>

Windows users installing PDAL via Conda may be running into issues with
missing libtiff.dll. This is ticketed with the upstream packages and will
hopefully be fixed soon. In the meantime, it is possible to workaround by
pinning to an older build of libtiff. The following should do the trick
(tested for Python 3.6)

conda create -n pdalenv -c conda-forge pdal libtiff=4.0.9=vc14_0

Subject: [pdal] Fill holes in dtm
Message-ID: <CA+jRDxDwi9uvy2JQyDLY7=sBeqSn2HLip8nt6tdxY5Urhn5wpA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I've been using pdal to filter some las files to create a dtm and ground
classified points. Its really excellent at doing this.
After doing this and creating a dtm, there are holes left in the DTM. I
cant find a way of filling the holes and was wondering are there tools in
PDAL to do this? See image below of houses etc removed from the dtm and now
need to be filled in.

Many thanks

I'm sorry, but there's nothing in the toolset that performs this function.
We'd be happy to look at integrating existing code or help someone
implement an algorithm .

it's not specifically a point cloud processing, but from raster side, you
can use many solutions, one of them is gdal_fillnodata.py script (package
python_gdal)

Shane,


There's tons of material on the website https://pdal.io/workshop/


Adam Steer also gave a workshop at FOSS4G Oceania last month too that
has even more content. Find it online at
https://github.com/adamsteer/f4g-oceania-pdal


Or did you mean in-person live examples? Presumably someone will proffer
the PDAL workshop for FOSS4G Bucharest and maybe FOSS4G-NA this year. It
would great if any power users wanted to take the materials and run with
giving the workshop in those kinds of venues. We would be happy to help
support them.

In OpenDroneMap, we run interpolation at multiple distances and then stack them back together to keep as many features as possible while also interpolating as best as possible between gaps:

It can get expensive, but it's easy to thread.

All,

Happy to announce the release of Entwine 2.0 (https://entwine.io), which
introduces the definition of the Entwine Point Tile [1] format: a lossless
static octree format for massive point clouds.

Check out the showcases of over a trillion points of public data with
Potree [2] and Plasio [3], or use the web-capable EPT reader [4] with PDAL
to query and run pipelines against these datasets or your own.

Get a copy of the software from https://entwine.io/download.html (conda
packages coming soon) and try it out with your own data.  Please file any
bug reports or contributions at https://github.com/connormanning/entwine.

Great stuff! IMO the ept + pdal system is finally pointing the way toward
really usable massive point cloud data.

Thanks to all who've been working away at it.

Cheers

Adam
