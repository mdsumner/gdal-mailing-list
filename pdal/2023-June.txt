Subject: [pdal] EPT JSON incorrect boundaries?
Message-ID: <DM6PR04MB6857942C35E8C83EEE561E43CB54A@DM6PR04MB6857.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,
I am using PDAL pipelines to query the AWS EPT JSON but having some issues with a couple of the USGS 3DEP projects. I'm using it successfully download different HUC12s worth of data in many Midwestern US locations but running into issues with what seem to be incorrect "bounds" in the AWS ept.json for a couple projects. I am receiving 0 points from the pipeline but there is clear overlap between the polygons. However, when I plot "bounds" from the two following EPT.JSON files they do not overlap with my request, which would explain the 0 points returned. The boundaries in the EPT.JSON only seem to be a subset of the extent referenced by the USGS WESM file (https://rockyweb.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/metadata/WESM.gpkg) and the EPT GEOJSON (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hobuinc/usgs-lidar/master/boundaries/resources.geojson) and the zipped tile boundaries I found for one of the projects (https://rockyweb.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/LPC/Projects/USGS_LPC_WI_Forest_2016_LAS_2019/metadata/)

The two ept.jsons I am currently experiencing issues with are:
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/USGS_LPC_WI_Forest_2016_LAS_2019/ept.json
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/SD_Southwest_B2_2018/ept.json

The WESM workunit_id for these projects are 66791 and 79125 respectively. The above JSONs reference coordinates that are within the WESM and EPT GEOJSON boundaries AFAICT for these projects but return no points since the EPT.JSON bounds don't overlap. I can provide additional coordinates or some screenshots if needed. Is there another explanation for what I'm experiencing? Or do the "bounds" for these files need to be rebuilt? Or is only a portion of the project data available via EPT for these projects?

Thank you,
Brian

All,

PDAL 2.5.5 has been released. It has a few small fixes including the ability to recognize .vpc files from the latest QGIS as STAC ItemCollections for readers.stac.

Find out more at https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/2.5.5 and Conda Forge builds should be complete by the end of the day or tomorrow some time.

Subject: [pdal] Make a boundary polygon closer to the point cloud
Message-ID: <CAP=Ak6iqZY8Nhx1Dgip5fHoyh0HOb-q+eVRMmZ05eREDkwV2Aw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello.
I have a question: What do I have to do to make the boundary polygon closer
to the point cloud?

I would like to obtain a boundary from a cloud point. When I do the
following instruction, the resulting polygon is very loose, with too much
air between the points and the boundary.

> pdal tindex create --tindex
..\GEOJSON\cloud513663ed34e703b5_boudary_prueba.sqlite --filespec
.\cloud513663ed34e703b5.las -f SQLite

The result look like this, where the red polygon is the resulting polygon
by tindex and the yellow is the polygon resulting by the command
lasboundary from lastools: https://postimg.cc/RNHGsDWH

I would like it to look like the example image:
https://pdal.io/en/latest/_images/boundary-qgis-view.png

What do I have to do to make the boundary polygon closer to the point cloud?

This is the image of the point cloud: https://postimg.cc/fVQC6fdg

Greetings.

Hi Ulises,

The tindex command uses filters.hexbin to create the boundary. It guesses
on the edge length of the hexagons used to form the boundary from a sample
of the data. If the sample isn't representative it may choose an
inappropriate edge length. You could try 1) sorting the data OR 2) setting
the edge length yourself with an option like --filters.hexbin.edge_size (I
think that's accepted by the "pdal tindex" command)

Good luck

Subject: [pdal] Kernel deprecation?
Message-ID: <0107C7DF-0B15-4742-851C-E1679A9D5F91@hobu.co>

I was wondering what the PDAL user community thinks about some of the PDAL kernels. For a lot of these capabilities, I find myself using simple pipelines or writing more complex logic using the new Python bindings. It is my hypothesis that many of you are doing the same. Specifically, are they being used? If so, what makes them successful for you (or not). 

* chamfer
* delta
* density
* eval
* ground
* hausdorff
* random

If we were to deprecate all of these in the upcoming PDAL 2.6.0 and removed them at PDAL 2.7.0, would you miss them? Which one(s) would you miss in your workflows?

Hey Howard

Good question. I tend to head for pipelines and python also. So my
vote is "do what is easiest for the PDAL team to maintain". If that
means deprecating the listed kernels, +1 from me. I've never used them
in practice or in training.

Cheers

Adam

This depends on what is meant by kernels.

I tend to use filters in a pipeline over the shortcut commands like 
'pdal ground'.? Generally, I find that I end up needing the extra 
flexibility available from pipelines compared to what is available 
directly from the command line.? If I do work directly from the command 
line, I tend to build an implicit pipeline using 'pdal translate' options.

So, I wouldn't miss most of the commands/applications much, but I'd be 
sad if the associated filters disappeared.? However, I do make extensive 
use of 'pdal info', 'pdal translate', 'pdal tindex', and 'pdal pipeline'.

We would not touch any of the associated filters. Just these commands:
