Subject: [pdal] free(): double free detected in tcache 2
Message-ID: <CADRrdKs536Vn3-xQHrFCMhT6+39ZiYah7xLqrXvG0PMkrurfGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi

I am trying to compile master branch of PDAL in my Ubuntu 20.04
Everything seems to be right during configuration and compilation. However,
running an application returns "free(): double free detected in tcache 2",
and core dump.

Debugging in a test (Log, t2), it failed calling "popen", that sounds very
strange to me.

Is this a known problem? Do I miss anything to build it properly?

I want to run the unit tests, but many are failing due to this problem.

The steps I made are these. There are a few warnings while compiling, but
no errors:

$ mkdir build

Hi,

May I know is there any way to use PDAL through pipeline to generate a colored tif (RGB in 3 bands each) from colored las file with RGB.

Any help is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.

That would be going from 3D to 2D - you probably need to specify how you
want to reduce the dimensions?

Using writers.gdal, we could specify only 1 dimension for 1 band to output a tif file.

However, how do we specify 3 dimensions (Red, Green, Blue) for 3 bands to output a tif file.


Thank you.

One idea, probably not optimal:

Use 3 writers.gdal stages and output each band to a different file.  Then
use GDAL to assemble the three files into a single TIFF.  (gdalbuildvrt
-separate, followed by gdal_translate to make a tiff from the VRT).

This is what I've done in the past, but one of the issues is PDAL's writers.gdal was interpolating using values outside the pixel, which is not ideal for picking pixel colors. For upcoming PDAL 2.5.0, we've added 'binmode' to writers.gdal [1], which will cause it to only consider points *inside* the pixel. This makes for better output in situations like this one (or making Intensity/Classification rasters).

Thank you Howard & James!

Is there any plan to add in more options to writers.gdal to output such
colored tif file...


Thank you.

No plans currently to implement multi-band output from writers.gdal. We would review a patch, but writers.gdal is already quite complicated and it is possible to construct what you want without any code changes, so it would have to be really compelling.
