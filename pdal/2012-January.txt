The IslandWood codesprint is only a month away, and all the cool pdal kids will be there.

My plan is to focus on docs: overall architecture, headers, and build instructions.  (Plus whatever bugs get tossed my way.)

Do you others have any specific plans?

I want to have the iterator and stage/schema relationship refactoring done before the sprint so that we can do any integration work that's required for it at that time.  Otherwise, I agree that documentation and examples to support outreach of PDAL to the wider community is now what we need to focus on for the IslandWood sprint effort.

Hi,

I compiled PDAL from source, and start to 'play' with in my Qt project.

My first goals are:
- learn pipeline/stage using sources
- create my own filter(s)

First question (maybe stupid): how can I know I get the options of a pdal::filter without using it ? Because I need:
- pdal::Stage& prevStage (but I don't have one)
- pdal::Option& options (this I can create an empty one)

About my first question (few minutes ago):

First question (maybe stupid): how can I know I get the options of a pdal::filter without using it ? Because I need:
- pdal::Stage& prevStage (but I don't have one)
- pdal::Option& options (this I can create an empty one)


--> Actualy, a pdal::filter as static functions s_getName() and s_getDescription() (automaticly implemented by SET_STAGE_NAME(name, description) ). So i get easily get the name and the description without instance of the class. About the default options i found this in StageBase.hpp:

/// Everyone must implement this.  If you want to access the list of
    /// options "statically", you are free to construct the stage with no
    /// arguments and cal getDefaultOptions() on it -- there is no need
    /// to call initialize(), so it should be a fast/safe operation.
    ///
    /// @return The default options.
    virtual const Options getDefaultOptions() const = 0;

So it's a virtual, not static. I tried : pdal::filters::Attribute::Attribute().getDefaultOptions(); but of course it's not correct :P

So how to get the default option withou filter instance ?

Thanks

I'm no longer sure.  It's a good question, though -- one that we've thought about.  Howard?

(For what it's worth, I hope that in a month from now we'll have some good tutorial/examples in the docs for this sort of thing.)

Right now you have to create a dummy pipeline and add your filters to it to get a real instance and then do getDefaultOptions.

How can we make this better?  Some sort of StageRegistry?

Yeh I start to instance all Stages and filters by using 
pdal::stagefactory::createReader,pdal::stagefactory::createFilter, or 
pdal::stagefactory::createWriter, but it's not working with empty 
options (even crashing).

Subject: [pdal] Raster overlay support added
Message-ID: <6D777BBE-C31B-45E6-A8E7-15106A69E94C@gmail.com>

All,

I have added a filter, incorrectly called Colorization, that supports querying GDAL to fetch raster values coincident with point data. While it is usually the case that you want to fill in the Red, Green, and Blue dimensions, you can also use this to fetch any other dimensions as well.  The default options assume that you are fetching color information.  The features of this filter currently include the ability to select the GDALRasterBand->Dimension mapping as well as individually apply a scaling factor to the returned raster results before stuffing them into your pdal::Dimension.

I will probably rename this filter to something like RasterOverlay or some other more appropriate name after discussing things at the sprint.
