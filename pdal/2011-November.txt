Your .i changes look great, except that they don't build against the PDAL head, due to LogPtr not being supported.  Did this compile for you?

(also, please don't commit any changes to mpg-config.bat, that's my private setup which I try to keep relatively constant - thanks)

Did you also have to comment out the %fragment line in swig's supplied std+_basic_string.i file?  I'd like to know what that problem is...    (What version of swig are you using?)

The C# bindings are currently broken, due to some namespacing issues that are causing the swig c++ parser to wig out.

I couldn't figure out a quick fix, I'll try to get back to it tomorrow morning if I can -- but if I don't, it'll likely have to stay broken for a while as I'm off on travel for the rest of the week.

I'm just wondering, perhaps it would be easier and more native to
Microsoft toolset
world to bind to C# through C++/CLI. Couple references:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163852.aspx
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jolson/archive/2007/11/22/managed-and-native-interop-c-or-c-cli.aspx

My gut feeling tells enabling a plain C++ library with .NET Common Type System
is easier using C++/CLI .

Just my 5 cents.

I've done both in the past, and my experience is that they're both wildly painful no matter what you do :-)

Plus I had this na?ve hope that the swig work would help us for Python bindings too.

If I had it to do over again, maybe I'd do it different.... But actually the swig bindings really do work fine, except when you have to tweak the .i file and you've already forgotten everything you learned about SWIG from when you had to tweak it last time 6 months ago...

Mea culpa!  Most humble apologies to the swig fan boyz out there...

The problem was actually some missing _declspec annotations.  All is well now in C# land.

I was seeing this error:
1>C:\swigwin-2.0.4\Lib\std\std_basic_string.i(48): error : Syntax error in input(3).

It happened also when I tried with SWIG v2.0.1.  My solution was to comment out the std_basic_string.i file.  Now, I see that as you suggested, commenting out the %fragment line in seems to solve the problem.

I was asked off-list how come there are no C# bindings when you do a build?

Excellent question -- the secret is that you have to build pdal itself first, then you need to load the solution file in the csharp/ directory and build that.  This is because (at least as of some months ago) cmake doesn't handle the swig/C# stuff very well, so I manually made a dedicated .sln for this.  There is also a README in that csharp/ directory.

FYI, the SWIG says "CMake (...) allows easy cross platform SWIG development."

Not sure what's the reality though :)

Message-ID: <4ECB65F9.6070303@terraimaging.nl>

Hi everyone,

I have some difficulties to compile PDAL on my computer:
- my compiler: MS Visual Studio 9 2008
- my installed libraries: boost 1.46.1, Qt4.7.2, OSGEO4W(gdal, ogr, 
laswip, liblas, ...)


Here what I do after downloading the zip of PDAL:

*cd c:\devCpp\LIBS\PDAL
cmake-gui*

In the CMake-Gui, I press the *Configure* button and set the 
*BOOST_LIBRARIES_DIR* until the configuration is done:

Searching for GDAL 1.6.0+ library
    NOTE: Required version is not checked - to be implemented
Searching for GeoTIFF 1.2.5+ library
Found GeoTIFF version: 1.3.0
Searching for LASzip 1.0.1+ library
Found LASzip version: 2.0.1
Searching for LibLAS 1.6.0+ library
Found libLAS version: 1.06.000
Configuring done

Then i generate the MS Visual Studio 9 2008 project file(s):
*Generate Done*


Open the PDAL.sln with MS Visual Studio 9 2008
Select release mode, then start to Build the solution (F7) then the drama :

I used the same method for the liblas, and it's working great. Here i 
don't understand why it's pointing so many errors.

Does anyone have an advice ?

Looking at line 56 of ReaderBase.hpp, I suspect you're not actually building off the latest sources on github, is that correct?

 

Beyond that, I also suspect that we're going to find that we're using some C++ constructs that VS2008 doesn't accept.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL compilation (MSVC9)

 

Hi everyone,

I have some difficulties to compile PDAL on my computer:
- my compiler: MS Visual Studio 9 2008
- my installed libraries: boost 1.46.1, Qt4.7.2, OSGEO4W(gdal, ogr, laswip, liblas, ...)


Here what I do after downloading the zip of PDAL:

cd c:\devCpp\LIBS\PDAL
cmake-gui

In the CMake-Gui, I press the Configure button and set the BOOST_LIBRARIES_DIR until the configuration is done:

Searching for GDAL 1.6.0+ library
   NOTE: Required version is not checked - to be implemented
Searching for GeoTIFF 1.2.5+ library
Found GeoTIFF version: 1.3.0
Searching for LASzip 1.0.1+ library
Found LASzip version: 2.0.1
Searching for LibLAS 1.6.0+ library
Found libLAS version: 1.06.000
Configuring done

Then i generate the MS Visual Studio 9 2008 project file(s):
Generate Done


Open the PDAL.sln with MS Visual Studio 9 2008
Select release mode, then start to Build the solution (F7) then the drama :

1>------ Build started: Project: pdal, Configuration: Release Win32 ------

bla bla ...



I used the same method for the liblas, and it's working great. Here i don't understand why it's pointing so many errors.

Does anyone have an advice ?

Thanks

We should do our best to support 2008, but given that neither Michael nor I actually build with VS2008, it'll be up to someone else to keep us honest and report errors and such on that platform.

Correct, I'm building from the zip PDAL-PDAL-72c7e33.zip. I just get the 
last version using git, and still 'some' errors:

Note, the first error is qt the line 54 :) Is that a progress  ? :-D



"we?re using some C++ constructs that VS2008 doesn?t accept." :-\
Give one more 'excuse' to work on linux :) But my colleagues will hate 
me (more) :)

Ok, if you pull the latest, PDAL now compiles for me with MSVC9 

Tests were able to be run as well.

I would suggest not using libLAS at all and instead depending on the native LAS driver that exists in PDAL.

Oooh, Hobu does VS2008 now!  Thanks for the pushing those fixes, I'll build under VS10 now and make sure all works there too.

After much consideration, I'm going to remove libLAS from my default build config also.  It was nice to have it as a backstop, but it is a burden for others to follow.

Subject: [pdal] Where are the C# bindings? 
Message-ID: <917263e147032e54a9675521aa91fc7c.squirrel@philipp.info>

Hi,

I successfully compiled the PDAL dll, but there seems that the main
compilation (from pdal.sln) doesn't execute the swig.exe, so I manually
executed it as followed:

C:\dev\swigwin>swig.exe -csharp -IC:\dev\PDAL\include -o pdal_wrap.cpp
-c++ -outdir C:\dev\PDAL\csharp\pdal_swig_cpp\
C:\dev\PDAL\csharp\pdal_swig_cpp\pdal.i

The Files seems to be complete (even with the pdal_wrap.cpp).

But I think that this isn't the way to create the PDAL swig files, isn't
it ? Because I copied the .cs files in the pdal_swig_cs directory and the
.cpp/.h files in the pdal_swig_cpp directory, reopened the pdal_swig.sln
and tried to build a debug version of the solution.

During the compiling, it deleted me EVERY .cs File in the pdal_swig_cs
Directory and the pdal_swig_cpp failed with the error:

Error	89	error MSB6006: "cmd.exe" exited with code 9009.	C:\Program
Files\MSBuild\Microsoft.Cpp\v4.0\Microsoft.CppCommon.targets	151	6	pdal_swig_cpp

This error also occurs, when there is no pdal_wrapp.cpp.

thx for any help,

Philipp

Philipp:

To build the C# bindings, you need to use the .sln file in the csharp/ directory.  This file is maintained manually -- it is not generated by cmake.  So, first build PDAL as normal, and then build pdal_swig (you can use the pdal_swig_test target): this will run swig to generate the .cs files, then compile the .cs files into an assembly.

The csharp/REAME.txt file has more details.

If you get stuck, just ask...

Hi

I finally compile the PDAL, for that had to use my computer at home on 
Windows7 and VC 2010 Express, 'Les doigts dans le nez'.
I'll try again to compile it on my office computer, but we order new 
computers, so I prefer to wait a bit and have a Windows7 64 bits with 
more than one core...

What the best PDAL pratice to store all the data into memory ?

Have a nice day.

What do you mean "store into memory"?  PDAL is designed to process data in chunks, so as not to require loading the whole file in memory...

Can you explain more, or give us an idea what your intended workflow is?

Hi,

My tool is to determinate the calibration parameters with a clear and 
pedagogic user interface.
- load the points and the trajectography in the memory
- display points as a picture
- make some cross sections
- Display the cross sections
- display a parameters button and 'doublespinbox'(using QT)
- change settings and see the result directly in the views
- save the settings, and apply them on all data (of the same flight of 
course :P )

A lidar point editor may also be interested to store the points info the 
memory. No ?

thanks.

OK, so if you just want to load (all) the points into memory, you can do two things:

- create a PointBuffer equal in size to the number of points in the file, and then just do one read() into it

- create your own storage system; then, read in the points one chunk at a time, and copy the points from the chunk-sized PointBuffer into your own storage area

Is that what you're looking for?

Some lidar files are VERY large, and it might not be practical to keep all the points in RAM.  In this case, you'd want to use some sort of thinning or decimating filter in the chain, so as to intelligently lessen the number of points you're managing and displaying.

Thank so PointBuffer is the solution provide by PDAL to store points in the memory. I'll try it.
For my particular application, I'll load the points (last echo only) whithin N PointBuffer for each strips. and clean up the areas where there is only one strip.
Very large files are already tiled into smaller square files (<10Millions points), so it's ok.
For many other purposes, I only need to read point, process it, write it.3
Thanks for your help.

No problem, happy to help.

I am planning several days of documentation work in February -- hopefully things will be easier for people then!
