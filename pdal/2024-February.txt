Message-ID: <EDF34B2F-E7FB-4458-A1CE-B8DDFE0CF0E0@hobu.co>

All,

I have issued PDAL 2.6.3 which is the final maintenance release of the 2.6-maintenance branch. 

It is mostly documentation fixes (thanks contributors!) and a fix to how readers.stac does filtering for filter/data coordinate system mismatches.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL usage for cave entrance detection
Message-ID: <CALe_dwOhh3ed2zwKw3eC4ggON7i_N7h73z3VwO9AeTTU+qnX5w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello guys,
I read some pdal documentation and I wonder if I can use pdal to analyze
some point cloud data to seach/evaluate ground level about cave entrance.

Some background about the project: french National Geographic Institute
distribute lidar data about french territory.
I am a member of a caving group and we aim to localize water spring/water
holes on some geographic area.
The laz categorization is not enough precise to detect small amount of
water or "ground water loss". So we find another way to dit it...
"Manually"... Now  with this visualisation tool ( potree), we where able to
identify those kind of small zones an successfully corelate real stuff with
predicted stuff (on potree).
Now we want to make this process automatic and make it suggests some small
zone. Instead spending very long time playing with visualisation tools on
all the point data (data provided by IGN are big data points 1kmx1km).

I'm not sure pdal can meet these goals. Maybe some expert here can provide
the answer an/or maybe some idea to point me using the right tools.

Thanks for your patience and help.
Hope my English was clear describing our goal.

Guillaume

Subject: [pdal] viewing extra_dims data
Message-ID: <CANurM1Q03jxts28Lr3eW1-Xg1SngHjujVK4Jiuy_XxjStKRDeA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am reclassifying vegetation into my own Low/Medium/High ranges and then
writing a new laz file, keeping the HeightAboveGround as an extra
dimension. Subsequently, in another pipeline I can use the
HeightAboveGround dimension in a filter just as a regular dimension, such
as assigning a color based on the value.

I can see the extra dimension using --metadata:

    "vlr_2":

    {

      "data":
"AAAKAEhlaWdodEFib3ZlR3JvdW5kAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhlaWdodCBBYm92ZSBHcm91bmQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA",

      "description": "Extra Bytes Record",

      "record_id": 4,

      "user_id": "LASF_Spec"

    },


I

Is there any way to check the values? using -p I get data for points but
not the value of the added HeightAboveGround dimension. --stats gives
statistics for the standard dimensions but not for the HeightAboveGround
dimension.

thanks, Nick

Nick,

Extra dimensions should show up like any other dimension, so without extra
information, it's hard to know what's going on. You can verify the extra
dimension more easily with "pdal info --schema". Perhaps provide the
pipeline/command used to create the file and the one used to gather
statistics.

Subject: [pdal] Conifer Identification/ return points that are below certain
 height below max veg height
Message-ID: <CAJW_ZYUbWHp-nM18Kt5qOiWz9Bb6kVXysGau5Gya3M2QmEWHkA@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to find a sneaky/elegant way of distinguishing Broadleaf and
Conifer trees from a 'Leaf Off' aerial survey made up of 27000laz tiles.
Looking at a transect example of the veg class there are no lidar returns
below a certain height for Conifers.(that are surrounded by other trees)

So any ideas how to filter(or add a dimension) the lidar below say 1.5m
below the max returns(this could be referenced to a tif file for max height)
and also the opposite for returning the top 1.5m values to then add to say
a grouping filter. which could then go towards a tree count or a learning
model.

For conifer identification i have also looked at the lidar Intensity values
but is a hit and miss process at the moment

Many thanks for any help given

Cheers

I think you would have to resort to Python to compute these things at the moment, but PDAL 2.7.0 is going to add math operations, which would be very useful for doing something like I did in this gist https://gist.github.com/hobu/36ea5fbec36412965ad9ef44cf4ade48

This won't work with PDAL 2.6, but the idea is to write an indicator dimension and then use filters.expression to filter based on MaybeTreeTops==1.

Here's my Colab notebook that does PDAL and Python-PDAL stuff. 

https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JQpcVFFJYMrJCfodqP4Nc_B0_w6p5WOV?usp=sharing

There was some work in the past month to get the condacolab thing happy again, but that seems to be good now.

Thanks for this- I'll be trying it out soon.

One more question. Do you have any plans to add a routine to do
voxelization of point clouds? By voxelization, I mean processing a point
cloud to create a 3d array with either the number of points in each voxel
or the sum of the intensities of the same points. Basically the same thing
that lasvoxel does. I've seen some pdal voxelization routines, but they
seem to be written with subsampling in mind. Perhaps one could be
repurposed for this application?
