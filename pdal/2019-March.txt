Subject: [pdal] clustering without ground returns
Message-ID: <CY4PR11MB17172F50A61784D9C2B1AEA59A760@CY4PR11MB1717.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

Good afternoon,

I am attempting to run a pipeline that will:

   1) Remove outliers
    2) Use a simple morphological filter to get ground returns
    3) Compute normal vectors and eigenvalues
    4) Use the filters.cluster to cluster points based on the Euclidean Cluster Extraction

The issue I am having is I would like to exclude ground returns from the cluster extraction. However, I am unsure of a way to get back the ground returns after I use a "filters.range", filtering out the ground classification. Is there a way to do this that I am missing? I know I can probably run 2 different pipelines but is there a way to do this all in one? Thank you so much in advance.

Steve

There is not a way to do this out of the box, though we've discussed the
need from time to time [1].

You can probably get away with using tags and inputs as described in the
pipeline documentation and tests [2, 3]. This effectively creates two
pipelines under the hood though.

Would it help if the cluster filter simply added an ignore option similar
to SMRF [4]?

Hi Folks,
This is probably something simple.  I am compiling pdal 1.8 from source and
i am running into a puzzling error.
Running this :
pdal translate -f filters.reprojection
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="EPSG:5070+5703"
4699/20130405_las_s23_2510_40.laz 4699_alb/20130405_las_s23_2510_40.laz

Gives me:

Any thoughts ?

Do you have the shift files installed with your GDAL install? If so, are
they in the standard location (/usr/share, I believe)?

Doug, 
Have you tried with 4.x? It get no errors with that in the 4.x series, I havenâ€™t yet compiled against 5.

I had the shift files installed , but removed them when I started seeing
the problem.  No effect.

Does this work with reprojection to simple SRS like 4326?

I remember having a bunch of trouble when using --with-static-proj.  I'd
suggest not setting that and using PROJSO env. var if you have libproj in a
non-standard location.

Howard, do you remember the issue with proj location in one of the
distros?  I know it was wrong and then got fixed, but I can't recall the
details.

I will set up a few virtual instances of ubuntu 18.04  at  home with
different options for proj over the next few days and see what happens.

I've been there.  Having spent way too much time on this, I still think
dynamic proj is the way to go.  Proj support in GDAL is painful.  Hopefully
the new release will cure that.

I'm not sure the "right" answer, but I got around that (first) error by specifying the full path to the geoidgrid file.Â  This required specifying the proj string (instead of the EPSG string) in the reprojection "out_srs" field.

I also specified the equivalent EPSG string in the "a_srs" field of the writer to make sure I got the standard metadata.Â  I'm not 100% sure this step is necessary.

Not to derail this thread, but since I just ran in to this with the
Windows version installed via conda-forge as well: Is the
filters.reprojection usage shown in Example 2 of the docs expected to
work? I was not able to combine +init +geogrids strings as shown in
that example and needed to specify the full proj string.

Good morning,

Is there a way  to ignore certain dimensions when running a pipeline?  I'm not currently using GPS time or RGB values so I wouldn't mind not having to consider those when processing.  Thanks!

Hi Steven,

It's not clear what you're asking.  If you're trying to avoid loading data
other than certain dimensions from a LAS file to save memory, no you can't
do that unless you're writing code at the API level.

Some PDAL commands use stream mode (https://pdal.io/pipeline.html#id2) when
possible to reduce memory use.

If you have another concern, you'll have to be more explicit in your
question.

Subject: [pdal] writers.gdal off by half a pixel?
Message-ID: <4935d19c-06de-1bb9-1e4e-4c49b2ae6891@gmail.com>

I noticed when round tripping a DEM through readers.gdal to LAS (or CSV) and then back to writers.gdal that the output was shifted from the input by about half a pixel.

I created a small 10x10 pixel test DEM and a simple pipelines to convert it to CSV via writers.text.Â  The X,Y coordinates in the CSV file match the center of the pixels of the source DEM as shown by QGIS, so I suspect that readers.gdal is correct.Â  I have another pipeline that is a readers.gdal into writers.gdal and QGIS shows the output DEM is shifted.

I would be happy to share the 10x10 DEM and the pipelines if there is an appropriate place for them.

I have attempted at a patch to writers.gdal that appears to fix this shift.

https://github.com/klassenjs/PDAL/commit/c80963e938853ebd63aebe4e8a6ce7e1d5d53cbf

I'm not sure I went about it the right way (vs redefining what m_offset means), but making the changes this way seemed like the least invasive way to make the code behave in a self consistent fashion.

Jim,

Are you sure it is the writer? Could it perhaps be the reader doing a pixel-is-area vs. pixel-is-point thing incorrectly?

My evidence for readers.gdal being correct:

gdalinfo shows AREA_OR_POINT=AREA.Â  I'm not sure that PDAL takes this into account, but "area" seems to be the default.Â  The writers.gdal output also sets AREA_OR_POINT=AREA.Â  It might be that the writer should be setting AREA_OR_POINT=POINT, but personally I prefer to be able to round trip the DEMs losslessly.

Running readers.gdal -> writers.csv matches the coordinates output by gdal2xyz.py.

The values in the CSV match the center of the pixel coordinate as shown in QGIS (as I would expect for AREA_OR_POINT=AREA).

Well, I have gotten a little further in my adventures on the home computer.
I found another instance of proj , removed it and cleaned all references
out. Just using proj 5.2 now
compiled libgeotiff from source
recompiled gdal 2.4.0 - (dynamic link to proj)
using pdal 1.8
The following command does a horizontal reprojection but scrubs out the
NAVD88 vertical projection and units  in the metadata ( as expected), but
leaves ( at least the max) vertical values unchanged
pdal translate 4699/20130405_las_s23_2510_40.laz 4699/alb_20130405_l
as_s23_2510_40.laz -f filters.reprojection
--filters.reprojection.in_srs="EPSG:4269"
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="EPSG:5070"

Removing the input projection assignment repeatedly gives:
(pdal translate filters.reprojection Error) GDAL failure (1) failed to load
datum shift file

Trying pdal translate 4699/20130405_las_s23_2510_40.laz 4699/alb_20130405_l
as_s23_2510_40.laz -f filters.reprojection
--filters.reprojection.in_srs="EPSG:4269"
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="EPSG:5070+5
703"

Gives the same error. In an effort to find the right vertical gtx file
/usr/local/share/proj now has :

alaska        epsg          GL           IGNF      nad27         null
               README.DATUMGRID     TN            WO

               stpaul               WI

not quite stuffing every datum grid into the directory.

Still get the same error even with the above projection information in the
/usr/local/share/proj directory
googling around, I found
https://www.gadom.ski/2017/05/31/vdatum-with-pdal.html

So I tried

pdal translate 4699/20130405_las_s23_2510_40.laz
4699/alb_20130405_las_s23_2510_40.laz -f filters.reprojection
--filters.reprojection.in_srs="EPSG:4269"
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="init=EPSG:5070
+geoidgrids=/usr/localshare/proj/g2012ba0.gtx"
--writers.las.a_srs=EPSG:5070+5703

and got PDAL: Could not import coordinate system 'init=EPSG:5070
+geoidgrids=/usr/localshare/proj/g2012ba0.gtx': (unknown reason).


So now, having thoroughly displayed my ignorance on how to handle gtx
files, does anyone have any suggestions?

Doug

Subject: [pdal] "resolution" keyword in
Message-ID: <CACrek76RUUEM+FgvNatDMCSkGcPkCw2NuwoZzu_MXakX+ftbCg@mail.gmail.com>

Is there more information available regarding how the 'resolution' keyword
works for the latest version of readers.ept?  Is it "gridding" the data at
a specified cell size?  If so, how does it handle nominal class data such
as lidar classifications?  Is it taking the first, last, or a random sample
to assign as the classification for each cell(assuming a scenario where
there are multiple classifications that fall within a given cell).  In
other words, how is the defining classification assigned for each cell
given a sample of points with varied classification values?

Thanks!

My understanding is that it isn't griding or making up new points or aggregating points or anything like that.Â  It returns a subset of the original points.Â  Which points it returns depends on what level of the ept tree that each of the original points was placed into when the tree was created.Â  The resolution parameter determines how many levels of the tree PDAL pulls points from.

As far as I can tell it takes no regard for non-spatial dimensions such as classification.Â  So, there isn't a direct way to for example query for only ground points at a certain resolution.Â  You have to query for all points and then filter out the ones that aren't ground (which will likely leave you with a lower resolution than you initially queried for in your final result).

The EPT format is essentially an octree of point data.  The resolution
options essentially tells the reader how far to descend the tree when
fetching data.

The resolution option is unrelated to point classification, so I'm not sure
that I understand your question.  Perhaps you can provide some more detail
or an example.

And, when I correct the typo in the path name ( seen after I had coffee
this morning) I get the same result.

Essentially, it seems I can work with the data without explicitly
specifying the vertical datum  ( in this specific case.)

Message-ID: <CADD7pkPqLEZLoBRFD+fZYPxyaseZe9n+B8ZrRW3Z27603nuzkQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm trying to run the SLPK reader in a pipeline I've written using the
Python API. I'm using the SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL.slpk file found at
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/tree/master/test/data/i3s .

Whenever I attempt to run this via the Python script, I get an error
message :
"RuntimeError: readers.slpk: Failed to fetch info: Could not read file
/tmp/SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL/3dSceneLayer.json.gz"

After looking at the code on Github, this appears to be something that is
called no matter when the SLPK extraction process throws an error, though
this could be wrong.

I'm not trying to do anything with filters yet, I'm simply trying to read
in the SLPK using readers.slpk. Is this a known issue that occurs?

Thanks!

It would help if you would post the program that is generating the error.

I have no trouble with this using a conda install of pdal and the
python-pdal extension.  SLPK files are unzipped to temp space before
they're actually read.  If you have no temp space, I could see a failure
like this.  Make sure you have /tmp that has sufficient space to hold the
slpk file (it's not compressed) or the TMP environment variable is set to a
location that has sufficient space.

Here's the script I used, which is yours, slightly modified:

import pdal
import numpy as np
import sys
import getopt


## TEST HARNESS
## TODO: begin placing some components of the test harness into functions
## TODO: Clean up the code in general
## TODO: Make sure to clean up pipeline options specifically and make it
all more flexible and ready for various input
if __name__ == "__main__":

    filepath = "autzen.slpk"

    print("Using {0}".format(filepath))

    pipeline_convert_tif = """
    {{
        "pipeline":[
            {{
                "type":"readers.slpk",
                "filename":"{0}"
            }},
            {{
                "type":"filters.info"
            }}
        ]
    }}""".format(filepath)

    # Start the pipeline work
    pipeline = pdal.Pipeline(pipeline_convert_tif)
    pipeline.validate() # Validate that defined pipeline is OK
    pipeline.loglevel = 8
    count = pipeline.execute()
    arrays = pipeline.arrays
    metadata = pipeline.metadata
    print (metadata)
    log = pipeline.log

Here's the start of the output:

$ python test.py

I've modified my code to use "filters.info" like yours and it still is
giving me that error. I have also verified that the directory I am
extracting the file into has sufficient space and write permissions. Are
you using the same file that I sent in the .zip file or is that a different
SLPK file?

Thanks,
David

I wouldn't have expected that to make any difference.  It just provided
some feedback that the data was actually loaded.

Yes.

I don't know what the problem might be.  I suppose you have run `pdal info
SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_All.slpk` with the same result?

Have you tried providing an absolute path when loading
SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL.slpk?

The script still returns the same error when run with either an absolute or
relative path.

Interestingly enough, running `pdal info filename` from the command line
seems to work fine. I can likely modify my top level program to call it
from the command line from now on.

Should I just attempt to transition to using the command line from now on
or is this an error we should continue to pursue?

David

Message-ID: <CACJ51z3uYqeKDz_=W+VNHOH7v7JGwUijrXdA5aZTn6iy2TaNjg@mail.gmail.com>

We're pleased to announce the release of PDAL 1.9 RC1.  This is a test
release which will become the 1.9 release if no significant problems are
reported.

Notable additions are support for TileDB, a writer for EPT sidecar data,
and default spatial reference support.

Note that if you build PDAL from source, you'll now need GDAL version 2.2
or greater and it should have GEOS support built-in.

You can review the release notes and download source code here:
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/1.9rc1

It would be nice to know what's wrong.  What is the source of your PDAL
installation?
