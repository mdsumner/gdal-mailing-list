Subject: [pdal] Unable to create hexer stage, PDAL_DRIVER_PATH
Message-ID: <CAHBySPZiThst7wUnQ0_Y=e-LaC4A_eoZwK9_TBm+apxvPdS3DA@mail.gmail.com>

Probably a total nobb question here but I'm new to PDAL. I build pdal 1.2.0
on Ubuntu 14.04 and try to build a tile index:
    pdal tindex --tindex tindex.shp --filespec *.las
And I get the error:
    PDAL: Unable to create hexer stage to create boundaries. Is
PDAL_DRIVER_PATH environment variable set?
So based on https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/788 I set:
    export PDAL_DRIVER_PATH=/usr/local/lib
But still no joy.

Suggestions?

Thanks,
Rich

Make sure that when you built, you built the hexbin filter.  Check that you
have a line in CMakeCache.txt that looks like this:

//Choose if the HexBin filter is built
BUILD_PLUGIN_HEXBIN:BOOL=ON

Rich,

Welcome to pdal land! You need to build the hexer (https://github.com/hobu/hexer) and then add that to your PDAL build.

If you don't want to build hexbin, you can also give the tindex kernel the --fast_boundary switch, which will just give you simple bounding boxes instead of tight(er) fitting boundaries.

All -

Thanks for the swift replies.

Just the getting the bounding box is all I need so I tried using
--fast_boundary:
    $*pdal tindex --fast_boundary --tindex tindex.shp *.las*
    PDAL: GDAL failure (1)
"/gis/Wyoming/22_Teton/DEM/NAVD88/Lidar2015/Alta/LAS_1.3/Alta_0101.las" not
recognised as an available field.

tindex.shp is an exiting, empty shapefile:
    $*ogrinfo index.shp index -so*
    INFO: Open of `index.shp'
          using driver `ESRI Shapefile' successful.
    . . .
    location: String (254.0)
    srs: String (100.0)

I'm missing something here....

Thanks,
Rich

Hmm.  Unsure.  PDAL will create the output file, in your case tindex.shp.
Try deleting it (or just specifying another output file) and see what
happens.  I've tried essentially your same command here with no trouble.

If PDAL can open the output index file, it tries to use it and assumes that
it has all the necessary fields to accommodate the output.  If you had an
existing, empty shapefile, this isn't going to be the case.  It happens to
error when it tries to write the filename to a field that we normally
create.  I'll try to get some better error checking/info for this.

Again, Thanks so much for the replies. Trying with a new (not an existing)
shapefile I get the same error:
    $*pdal tindex --tindex newindex.shp *.las --fast_boundary*
    PDAL: GDAL failure (1)
"/gis/Wyoming/22_Teton/DEM/NAVD88/Lidar2015/Alta/LAS_1.3/Alta_0101.las" not
recognised as an available field.

"/gis/Wyoming/22_Teton/DEM/NAVD88/Lidar2015/Alta/LAS_1.3/Alta_0101.las" is
the first file in the directory so it's weird that it's complaining about
it being a "field".

A new shapefile is created with four fields and but no rows:
$*ogrinfo newindex.shp newindex -so*

FWIW - I built hexer and rebuilt pdal w/ hexer and now I'm getting the same
error that I get when using * --fast_boundary*
    PDAL: GDAL failure (1)
"/gis/Wyoming/22_Teton/DEM/NAVD88/Lidar2015/Alta/LAS_1.3/Alta_0101.las" not
recognised as an available field
"Alta_0101.las" is the first file in the directory. I tried on two other
directories with data from different sources and got the same error
referring to the first file in the directory.

The results from
   $*pdal info Alta_0101.las*
Look pretty reasonable, not that I know anything about Lidar data, but the
values shown are all within ranges that I expect for my coordinate system.

Thanks for the advise so far.

Rich

To any interested, the problem was a change in the way that GDAL is now
parsing certain statements in version 2.0, which is different from the
handling in the 1.X releases.  The issue has been addressed in PDAL with
following:

All,

Pete Gadomski and myself gave a PDAL workshop at UNAVCO a couple of weeks ago [1], and we developed a 100+ page book of materials and examples for people to follow using Docker. I have included this workshop in the PDAL website [2] along with a significant reshuffling of documents in hopes of making it quicker and easier to find the things you are looking for. Additionally, the new theme (from ReadTheDocs) works on mobile.

I'm interested in your feedback. Is the organization better? What things are you looking for when you're on the website?

Finally, for your dead-tree enjoyment, the entire documentation set is now available as a single 450+ page PDF [3]

It looks like PCL plugin is missing update related to this change
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/commit/2b2eeba95906f5a96fab88d88fb0a0fae59397df

Perhaps it will be enough to patch the
pdal/plugins/pcl/kernel/ViewKernel.cpp:139

Stage& readerStage(Kernel::makeReader(m_inputFile));

to read

Stage& readerStage(Kernel::makeReader("kernels.view", m_inputFile));

Subject: [pdal] Documentation on using PDAL
Message-ID: <CAK-Gv8TKiRPOumo94TPR9x6fJn5i9+kR0tqPsqSykJg7g+BeyA@mail.gmail.com>

Dear list,

I'm evaluating using PDAL to read and write LAS files. My use case is
focused on the following requirements:
- accessing to individual points on the LAS files (sometimes sequentially
and sometimes to specific records using record number)
- learning about LAS file properties (coordinate reference system of the
data, number of records, existing fields [which depends on the record point
type in use], etc)
- creating new LAS files and writing individual points to them
- appending individual points to existing LAS files, maybe also editing or
deleting existing points

Is PDAL able to satisfy these use cases? I have read the online
documentation, but it seems to be really focused on translating from one
format to another one, and there is little information about how to
actually accessing the points.

The "Writing with PDAL" tutorial [http://www.pdal.io/tutorial/writing.html]
gives me some light on the writing part, but I still don't see if it really
matches our use case. If I correctly understand the tutorial, you have to
first create a PointTable and a PointView, which I guess are created
on-memory.

Is there a way to "stream" the points to the writer? Otherwise I believe
this approach is not feasible for writing big LAS files. Would be possible
to create the writer on "append" mode and to feed it with several
PointViews on a loop for instance?. Will this approach perform well or is
there a better way to do it?

Thanks in advance,

César Martínez Izquierdo

Just to clarify my previous email, I mean using PDAL using its C++ API (not
from the command line).

Brad told me nobody was using the PCL viewer.  I guess that's incorrect :)

The change should be to:

Stage& readerStage(Kernel::makeReader("m_inputFile, ""));

I'll make the change in master.

César,

Vaclav's document has a little bit of guidance on this topic, but you are correct in there isn't a whole lot of "I just want to read points in my C++ application" tutorial or documentation. See http://www.pdal.io/tutorial/liblas_to_pdal.html

Other responses inline...

Some drivers, such as readers.las, support one-at-a-time reading. There probably very little performance benefit to doing so unless you have extremely large files and you're trying to conserve memory as you read for some reason. 

> - learning about LAS file properties (coordinate reference system of the data, number of records, existing fields [which depends on the record point type in use], etc)

Stage, PipelineManager, and PointTable all have methods to get MetadataNode instances, which are a tree of information that would include that kind of stuff for LAS. Each driver produces different metadata, and filters can add to a PointTable's metadata as the process as well.

I think you will find the code for "pdal translate" instructive. See [1] for more details.

> - appending individual points to existing LAS files, maybe also editing or deleting existing points

Nope. No open source LAS library supports that one very well. Too many ways to screw up, and it's much simpler just to write a new file. LASlib supports a little bit of in-place header modification, but that can be dangerous if the header size is changing. Not worth the pain.

The website documentation is indeed focused on external use of PDAL through pipelines and applications, but there is a very deep codebase to do the kinds of things you want. There aren't so many docs on those, however, and you'll have to read through code and tests [2] for guidance and inspiration.

Others may have some experience on this topic. I think what you are describing is possible, but you should do some tests to see if it is really going to be a problem.

As was mentioned, you can stream points to the writer with LAS depending on
what other processing you might want to do.  When you call execute(), just
pass a FixedPointTable instead of a PointTable.  Unless you are
memory-limited, it's not likely to amount to a huge performance
improvement, though.

You really need to be specific about your needs to allow us to provide you
good information.  It's best to write a little code and not make to make
too many assumptions about problems before you start.

Best,

Regarding our needs, the library would be used on a desktop GIS software
(gvSIG), so the use cases are quite diverse. We would implement a LAS data
provider for our own framework, this provider would be internally based on
PDAL.

Therefore, typical usages could be:
- To access all the LAS points on a sequential way (to draw the layer)
- To access all the LAS points on an area (when zooming to the layer)
- To access a single LAS point (info by point)
- To write a new LAS file, the input of which could be any other point
layer loaded on our GIS software (including another LAS/LAZ file but it
could also be Shapefiles for instance). Note that because we have our own
abstraction layers, we will not be able to directly use a PDAL reader as
the input of a pipeline in this case (although we might create a custom
reader that wraps our gvSIG data providers)

As LAS files can be sometimes huge, I am specially worried about PDAL
reading/writing strategies. Does a las_reader.execute(table) (as shown on
the libLAS to PDAL tutorial) load the full file on-memory? Or does it load
blocks on demand when you actually request one point to the ViewSet?

If everything is read on-memory, the I guess we'll need to limit the number
of loaded points, but at the same time it would probably simplify the
implementation of our data provider.

Our software (gvSIG) is written in Java, so using PDAL means writing some
Java-C++ bindings, that's why we want to carefully assess if PDAL fits our
needs before actually implementing anything. I was (probably wrongly)
feeling that libLAS could better suit our needs, but I am aware PDAL is
much more active nowadays.

Thank you very much for the documentation pointers and ideas, the "libLAS C
API to PDAL transition guide" is very useful.

This just isn't possible.  The LAS format doesn't provide a spatial index.

This is an unusual requirement for point clouds.  There isn't usually much
information in a single point.

You just need to put your data into a PDAL PointTable (usually using a PDAL
PointView) and then PDAL can write the data.  There are fancier things that
can be done that require more code on your part.

There are no blocks in a LAS file.  Points in LAS files may be in any order
whatsoever and there is no spatial index, which is why reading all points
is usually the only solution.  This is a limitation of the file format and
not PDAL.  Many people break large files into geographically-based
subfiles, or tiles, but then you're just reading smaller LAS files and have
to do your own organization and preprocess the data.  Some people use PDAL
to read points from a LAS file and place them in a database that supports
spatial indexing, like Postgres, SQLite or Oracle.  HOBU also has a
level-of-detail indexed format readable through PDAL that can be used by
visualization which you might want to consider, but it's not directly
reading points from LAS.

You can limit memory consumption by streaming points, as mentioned
earlier.  If you can use the data directly from PDAL's PointTable/View for
visualization streaming won't buy you anything since you need to store the
data somewhere anyway.  However, most people doing visualization software
need to load the data on a graphics card so using PDAL's buffer doesn't
make sense.

Our software (gvSIG) is written in Java, so using PDAL means writing some

Message-ID: <CALAZn4iHjfvDOKNo2iQJr0piWcvf3yd32D3370W48zOrHFGt0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello All,

I'm compiling pdal 1.2 on windows to use the json syntax instead of the xml
one. I use the github version checking out hte tag 1.2.0. The compilation
goes fine, but it ends up missing the dependent dlls

I've changed the install directory and I use nmake to compile. Into the
install directory, nmake builds  a few pdal static libs under libs and the
pdal.exe plus tests under bin.

As dependencies, cmake found the OSGeo4W64 import .lib libs for gdal,
geotiff, laszip, xml... and so on.

I've tried copying all the osgeo dlls into the pdal bin directory. In that
situation, it doesn't complain about the dlls, but it fails to launch
pdal.exe with the message the application was unable to start correctly
c00007b, which I guess is due to wrong dlls.

If I tell cmake to build the shared libraries, then I get the error
pcpipelineTestJSON.cpp.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol
"class testing::internal::Mutex testing::internal::g_linked_ptr_mutex"

even if I disable the build tests options.

I guess I could fix the error above, but I don't think that would solve the
dll problem.

If I tick the build static option, i have the same problem with the dlls.

I am open to do more tests etc. I could also use MSBuild to build, if you
thing it would change things.

Cheers!

Pol

Thanks Howard!

Some didn't make it to it:

My purpose is to use pdal 1.2.0 on windows. The binary provided by
OSGeo4W64 is version 1.1.0, which doesn't support the json syntax.

To do so, I thought I'd compile it from source, leading to the mentioned
problems.

What I'm doing is compiling with cmake and nmake. I use cmake-gui to change
the options I've mentioned and then I just run nmake which compiles the
code.

So the commands would be cmake-gui .. and nmake (or nmake install)

The output is normal, it builds the pdal binary and other targets. e.g.
[100%] Build target pdal

If I then run pdal.exe I get the typical* missing dll* windows pop-up. If I
add the missing dlls, then the message changes to the application was
unable to start correctly c00007b

If, on the cmake step, I select the option 'Build shared libraries', then I
get the compilation error pcpipelineTestJSON.cpp.obj : error LNK2001:
unresolved external symbol "class testing::internal::Mutex
testing::internal::g_linked_ptr_mutex".

So my question would boil down to: has anybody built pdal 1.2 on windows?
Might somebody have a clue about the 'unable to start correctly' error?
Should I download all the dependencies source code and compile them, do you
know which are the dll correct versions and where to find them?

I have the development enviroment set up, so I am gladly available to help
compiling pdal 1.2 for windows if you wish :) For now I use the linux
docker version.

Cheers,

Pol

All,

A reminder that both Brad Chambers and myself will be at FOSS4G North America talking about PDAL next week. I will be discussing point cloud web services, and Brad will be talking about using PCL with PDAL. See http://www.pdal.io/#news for links and more information.

Also, make sure to find us to grab a copy of the new PDAL laptop sticker.

Nice! And I will mention how PDAL can be used from GRASS GIS right before
your talks.

Subject: [pdal] Filtering out coplanar points
Message-ID: <CALjAYt5Jq8ZrzKVS8h8EQMjwe=5CfTfd=We3QbkCeJL9hP4OdA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi list,

I'm looking for a way of thinning a point cloud by scoring points according
to the information they bring according to an interpolated surface (such as
a DEM). PDAL can filter points randomly either on a grid or systematically,
but I'd like to keep points that indicate an inflection and remove points
that are within a plane tolerance (since they don't bring much information
if the points are linearly interpolated to a surface). I know PCL can
compute normals, could that be leveraged to provide a smarter way to thin a
point cloud or harnessing the progressive morphological filter? I haven't
found much relevant literature on that, but there must be. I probably don't
have the right terminology. If you have any insights, I'd appreciate.

One way to think about it would be to

   - Generate a DEM with the whole set of points;
   - For each point in dataset:
   - remove a point and generate another DEM;
      - compare the change in elevation (or volume or whatever metric you
      want) using e.g. RMSE;
      - associate RMSE value to the removed point;
   - Remove point with lowest RMSE, repeat until you reach a user-defined
   threshold.

This would be tedious, there's probably a better way. I thought it might
trigger some ideas or help people send me in the right direction.

Etienne,

Are you hoping to put together a pipeline using existing PDAL (and possibly
PCL) filters? Or are you open to creating something new altogether?

I think you will have the best luck going the latter route, although you
may have some success coding up your algorithm in Python, using the
programmable filter [1], in which case you can use PDAL out of the box. PCL
can even be used in front of the Python code to generate normals - it just
wouldn't be available to you within the Python environment.

It'll be up to you to determine the best approach for scoring your points,
but the framework for building your algorithm using PDAL and PCL should all
be in place. I'd be tempted to write a new PDAL plugin that implements a
filter [2] and leverages some of PCL's modules (e.g., computing normals,
SAC segmentation, etc.). The ground filter in our PCL plugin [3] should
give you a good feel for how such a filter would be organized and built.

Best of luck!

Brad

Hi Bradley,

I'm looking for the highest-level solution, and if it requires building a
new filter I would consider it although I'd had to find the time to do it
properly. My only reservation with coding it in c++ is that I haven't
settled on a solution yet, so having the ability to try different
approaches in python seems valuable to iterate rapidly and find a working
solution. It is still very interesting to see that PDAL gives access to
many pieces to manipulate points efficiently.

Hey dear list,
I have a simple question :
concerning the pgpointcloud driver.

Is there currently some way to compress/uncompress the patches in the
client (rather than the database) in writting/reading process?

Thanks

Remi,

I think the comments on line Writer#483 are a little inconsistent. Writer looks like it always inserts uncompressed, hex-encoded data to PostgreSQL and lets the extension do what it wants with it for compression. On the PgReader side, it looks like it always asks for  PC_Uncompress which presumably has no impact when the patch is actually uncompressed. 

Maybe Paul can chime in with more detail on the intent of how this is supposed to work.

You have to run a single pipeline over each file in a script and substitute as appropriate

Can you post some of your pipeline examples? I presume you are talking about http://www.pdal.io/tutorial/reading.html?highlight=loop#loop-a-directory-and-filter-it-through-a-pipeline which will need some modification to work if you are using Docker and windows.

Yes, I am talking about http://www.pdal.io/tutorial/reading.html?highlight=loopBlocked#loop-a-directory-and-filter-it-through-a-pipeline.  I've updated the script to point into the correct locations (i.e. my data directory and appropriate subdirectories) as well as the location of the json.

You have to run a single pipeline over each file in a script and substitute as appropriate

Are there additional wildcards or code that needs to be included/not included in the *.json?

Can you post some of your pipeline examples? I presume you are talking about Blockedhttp://www.pdal.io/tutorial/reading.html?highlight=loopBlocked#loop-a-directory-and-filter-it-through-a-pipeline which will need some modification to work if you are using Docker and windows.

This is the one you need to use, it has slots for both the reader and writer file. A pipeline without a reader isn't valid, and one without a writer can't write.

You can test this by running manually:

> pdal pipeline -i /path/to/pipeline.json --readers.las.filename=/data/CRREL/split/CRREL_Split_2.laz --writers.las.filename=/data/CRREL/split/Denoise/CRREL_Split_2_Clean.laz

> pdal pipeline -i /path/to/pipeline.json --readers.las.filename=/data/CRREL/split/CRREL_Split_3.laz --writers.las.filename=/data/CRREL/split/Denoise/CRREL_Split_3_Clean.laz

PDAL allows you to substitute or override options via the command line, but they need to exist in the pipeline first.

Pgpointcloud lets you extract compressed results. If you don't apply
the PCUncompress function, you get the compressed version, as it lives
in the disk serialization. I didn't make this a standard thing for
PDAL driver because I didn't want people to get into the habit of
copying the comressor/decompressor code everywhere. If we had a
standard compression like laszip in use, so standard decompressors
could handle it, that would be better.

Writer looks like it always inserts uncompressed, hex-encoded data to PostgreSQL and lets the extension do what it wants with it for compression. On the PgReader side, it looks like it always asks for  PC_Uncompress which presumably has no impact when the patch is actually uncompressed.

lazperf compression, which is used by PDAL for both the Oracle and SQLite drivers, is on the roadmap for pgpointcloud but thus far hasn't been implemented. 

https://github.com/pgpointcloud/pointcloud/issues/81

lazperf has not been turned into a system library yet, and that might be the biggest impediment to making it available to both pgpointcloud and PDAL. The software development to support it inside of the pgpointcloud extension would not be too difficult, however.

Howard, Michele,

Can't you also use something like xargs?
 eg:   ls *.laz | xargs -I{} pdal pipeline mypipe.json
--readers.las.filename={} --writers.las.filename=/my_new_dir/{}

If using this via docker, just get into the container to run this.

Thanks guys ^^

So if I understand well for the moment all compression/decompression should
happen in database,
untill the code for compression/decompression is made into a standard lib.

Cheers,

Are you processing NITF files?  If not, you can just turn it off in
CMakeCache.txt with:

BUILD_PLUGIN_NITF:BOOL=OFF

Otherwise you can get NITRO from:

Disabling in CMakeCache.txt or by cmake does not work. Still the same error:

-- checking for one of the modules 'spatialite>=4.2.0'
CMake Error at
/usr/share/cmake-2.8/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:108

Isn't there also an error on line 75 in src/CMakeList.txt? The closing
double brackets?
