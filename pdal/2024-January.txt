Subject: [pdal] How to calculate point cloud density?
Message-ID: <CAP=Ak6gNPXo4M4+BCrf0aEYx1Pk06E_U3tOYOwQnghm1czmcFw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello, I have a huge doubt:

Previously, to calculate the density of a point cloud I used the following
command:

pdal density input_pointcloud.laz -o density.sqlite -f SQLite
--filters.hexbin.edge_size=1

But now that it has been depreciated to the density application, then: what
order would I have to use to continue obtaining a sqlite file with hexagons?

Or should I use what is stated in the email:
https://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/pdal/2023-December/002729.html, where
Michael says that he used a with the following content:

"pipeline":[
    {
        "type":"readers.las",
        "filename":"/home/lefsky/time_trials/tile_67_136_sub_2.laz"
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.gdal",
"filename":"/home/lefsky/time_trials/tile_67_136_sub_2_density.tif",
   "dimension":"Z",
        "data_type":"Float32",
        "output_type":"count",
        "resolution": 1
    }
  ]
}

?

Cordially

Subject: [pdal] Question on filters.assign
Message-ID: <CAPryQ-NG+z5YA_DM3LL+8cGmTbR2iUbmC_BWf9sS5xFsdgFgyw@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a voxelization problem and am having difficulty with
filters.assign.
The purpose of the code is to 1) add the HeightAboveGround dimension to
las points using a dtm, copy the Z value of each point to a backup
dimension (PassiveZ), and then calculate a new Z as:

((Z-minx)/scalefactor)+HeightAboveGround


I voxelize the resulting LAS and should get an image of vertical profiles
that includes information about topography and canopy structure, like so:

[image: image.png]

The problem I have is that when I run the JSON for it, I get the
following message:

(pdal_261) lefsky at lefsky-X10DRi:~/time_trials$ pdal pipeline
tile_66_136_sub_01hagscale.json

*PDAL: filters.assign: *

If I remove the filters.assign section, the json runs without a problem.

The Json follows.

I also have another, simpler, problem involving the extra_dims keyword for
writers.las. I see the explanation about how to format the specification
for extra_dims (<dimension_name>=<type>) but I couldn't get it to work and
I don't see any examples of proper formatting to follow.

Any help is appreciated.

Michael

You didn't say the version you're using but I'm assuming it's not the
current master branch.

The ability to create a dimension with the assign filter was just added.
Until that hits a release, you have to use filters.ferry to create the
dimension. (I hope that) the lack of error display for this case has also
been recently fixed.

Try:

{
  "type": "filters.ferry",
  "dimensions: "Z => PassiveZ"
}

before your assign filter.

Hi Howard:
I run some like this, and look like it works:
[
     {
         "type":"readers.las",

 "filename":"cloud6cb301139efa9d25_GGM2010_scale_offset_translated.las"
     },
     {
         "type":"writers.gdal",

 "filename":"cloud6cb301139efa9d25_GGM2010_scale_offset_translated_densidad1m2.tif",
         "dimension":"Z",
         "data_type":"Float32",
         "binmode":true,
         "output_type":"count",
         "resolution":1
     }
     ]

what do you think?

* The 'density' option was added in PDAL 2.6 https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/4244
* For now, it only outputs GeoJSON, so my previous example wasn't quite right. The following 'pdal translate' would also work with 2.6:

> pdal translate myfile.las counts.tif --writers.gdal.resolution=10 --writers.gdal.binmode=true --writers.gdal.output_type="count" --filter hexbin --filters.hexbin.edge_length=10 --filters.hexbin.density=myfile.geojson --filters.hexbin.threshold=1

I have had success using the condacolab library to first install conda in the Colab runtime and then installing pdal. You could follow the syntax in the final comment on this Github issue to give it a try: https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2432. This solution was proposed by @Howard Butler<mailto:howard at hobu.co>, so he may know a better way to do it these days. I would also be interested to learn if there is a better way to do this!

Hope this helps,
-Cole

your side as well.
Here's the link:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ovjQcVj_-ejTef5f6-iR4wbGeTpqQpuU?usp=sharing

Currently, it stores the files in the local Colab directory which gets
refreshed every time the session is restarted. You can also mount the
Gdrive and use that to store files.

Hope this helps!

Subject: [pdal] Conda install/update of Jupyter breaks PDAL python
Message-ID: <CANurM1Q=7rj38nfno6o9TnwEJfaAM78j6t+LwSdTkZqn0YqQsw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone,

I recently installed Jupyter into a conda environment with pdal-python
already installed and working and it broke pdal due to draco getting
updated from 1.5.6 (works with pdal 2.5.6) to draco 1.5.7 which brings with
it
/lib/libdraco.9.0.0.dylib
lib/libdraco.9.dylib -> libdraco.9.0.0.dylib
lib/libdraco.a
/libdraco.dylib -> libdraco.9.0.0.dylib
.  thus causing: '@rpath/libdraco.8.dylib error not found.

/lib/libpdal_plugin_reader_draco.dylib
used lib/libpdal_plugin_reader_draco.15.6.0.dylib which needs
libdraco.8.0.0.dylib

you need to specify draco==1.5.6 to avoid this, which is easier than
downgrading it (takes less time), but downgrading works also

try: conda install example_package 'draco<=1.5.6'

regards, Nick

Yes, there is a bad or incomplete pin for draco for the PDAL recipe. I will try to get it rerendered over the weekend here.

Follow along at https://github.com/conda-forge/python-pdal-feedstock/pull/96 if it is interesting.

Subject: [pdal] Help by reprojection of laz file
Message-ID: <CAPOK4ocZkMoZJRUFAwEoZDLO_d74pODUFAmyRKBE=WUV7oBEhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

i try to reproject from EPSG:28992 to EPSG:4326. This doesn?t work. The
result is a straight line.
Original:
[image: image.png]

Projected:
[image: image.png]

This is the command i use: pdal translate ./Test/original.laz
./Test/projected.laz reprojection
--filters.reprojection.in_srs="EPSG:28992"
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="EPSG:4326" --writers.las.scale_x=0.0000001
--writers.las.scale_y=0.0000001 --writers.las.offset_x="Auto"
--writers.las.offset_y="Auto"



The spatial reference of the original file is: PROJCS[\"Amersfoort / RD
New\",GEOGCS[\"Amersfoort\",DATUM[\"Amersfoort\",SPHEROID[\"Bessel
1841\",6377397.155,299.1528128,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"7004\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"6289\"]],PRIMEM[\"Greenwich\",0,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"8901\"]],

UNIT[\"degree\",0.0174532925199433,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9122\"]],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"4289\"]],PROJECTION[\"Oblique_Stereographic\"],PARAMETER[\"latitude_of_origin\",52.1561605555556],

PARAMETER[\"central_meridian\",5.38763888888889],PARAMETER[\"scale_factor\",0.9999079],PARAMETER[\"false_easting\",155000],PARAMETER[\"false_northing\",463000],

UNIT[\"metre\",1,AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"9001\"]],AXIS[\"Easting\",EAST],AXIS[\"Northing\",NORTH],AUTHORITY[\"EPSG\",\"28992\"]]



I use the pdal version: *2.6.0*

But i also tried 2.6.2 with same result.



When i look at epsg.io the transformation from EPSG:28992 to EPSG:4326
should be possible.



I don?t know what i?m doing wrong. I tried with several laz-files but the
result is the same for all of them.

I hope anybody can give me a hint.



Kind regards

Heiko

Your transformation is working properly, but you are viewing the data in a
viewer which interprets your data as cartesian.  Your XYZ range of
(degrees, degrees, meters) is probably something like (0.0000001,
0.0000001, 100), and since your Z-values are several orders of magnitude
larger than the XY, you get a vertical line when you interpret this as
cartesian.  You can use any non-geographic coordinate system for a better
viewing experience (or find a viewer that understands geographic
coordinates), but there's nothing wrong with your data transformation
itself.
