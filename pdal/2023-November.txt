Subject: [pdal] Points per voxel calculation
Message-ID: <CAPryQ-PBe-mV3GZp13aD-6je52fVqwuHTebTqNJNMhhUv_9-cQ@mail.gmail.com>

I am new to pdal and have a high priority request for information. I need
to calculate the number of points within voxels of specified size. Can pdal
do this?

Thanks in advance,

Michael

Two more questions:

After I calculate Height Above Ground, how do I update the Z value with
those values?

pdal doesn't recognize the --zero_ground. I get "PDAL: kernels. translate:
Unexpected argument 'zero_ground'." Is this a known issue?

Thanks again,
Michael

There are documented examples of moving/updating values from one dimension
to the other in filters.assign and filters.ferry.

Without any more detail on your HAG pipeline, it is really not possible for
anyone to help you. You could search the issues on GitHub to see if someone
else has documented an issue with zero_ground. Note that there are multiple
HAG filters and not all support this option. We don't know which you are
attempting to use.

All,

I have issued PDAL 2.6.1 which is a maintenance release of the 2.6-maintenance branch. It fixes some small performance regressions, debugging lint noise, and a couple of small crashes.
