Subject: [pdal] 2.4.0 Freeze
Message-ID: <A0DAE040-8D2B-4686-8D64-18EF820A67FF@hobu.co>

All,

We are now in the release freeze period for the PDAL 2.4.0 release. Some upcoming features and capabilities the next release will contain include:

* LAZ support is now always available and embedded in the PDAL library through its use of the recently relicensed laz-perf library. PDAL no longer requires or supports linking against an external LASzip or laz-perf library. Visit https://github.com/LASzip/LASzip/pull/80 to find out more about LASzip and laz-perf relicensing to Apache Public License from LGPL.
* readers.copc and writers.copc drivers. COPC is a backwards compatible LAZ file stored as a clustered octree. Find out more about COPC at https://lidarmag.com/2021/12/27/cloud-native-geospatial-lidar-with-the-cloud-optimized-point-cloud/ and https://copc.io
* C++17 is now required. C++17 provides <filesystem>, and this is now used and previously vendored boost code to provide similar support is now removed.
* JSON comments in pipeline are ignored without error, but not preserved. This is due to catching up to a more recent nlohmann JSON library that supports stripping comments from JSON
* writers.las and writers.copc now support setting VLR data using metadata keys.
* writers.gdal now supports writing PDAL metadata and pipeline as base64 GDAL raster metadata items.

Thank you to all contributors who have provided feedback, tickets, and testing on this release. Expect a release candidate next week with the final 2.4.0 release to follow the week afterward.

Howard

All?

I?m using USGS 3DEP point-clouds to generate surface-height rasters around Longmont, CO. The point-cloud files have spurious returns over many of the lakes/reservoirs in the area that are tagged other than 7 or 18. They?re streaks about 0.3 m long located 200+ m above the lake. In most cases the streak has 3?8 points, but I?ve found one with 34 points.

The outlier filter with statistical or radius methods doesn?t remove these longer streaks. Any recommendations on removing dense groups of points well separated from the main mass?

I?m having success with:

{
"type": "filters.outlier",
"method": "radius",
"radius": 16.0,
"min_k": 64
}

This seems to do the trick of removing isolated groups while leaving the main body of points alone, but I?m thinking these some other dimension that could be calculated and added to points then used to remove outlier groups later.

Cheers,

Andreas

Is there any chance the points are marked as withheld? I've seen quite a
bit of data where bad points are marked as withheld but not marked as noise.

They?re mostly marked at 1 (unclassified) but I?ve seen a few that are 11 (road surface)!

Andreas,

You might have luck with
https://pdal.io/stages/filters.reciprocity.html#filters-reciprocity or
https://pdal.io/stages/filters.miniball.html#filters-miniball, though I
think both may require a bit of trial and error to determine the correct
neighborhood size to use.

In the first, I think you'd need a neighborhood size larger than the
cluster such that you are also finding points outside the cluster. Then
you'd need to filter on the Reciprocity expecting that a percentage of the
neighbors in the cluster are not found in the reciprocal neighborhood. If
you read the docs, it should make sense.

For miniball, the intuition is simply that the miniball formed from the
points in the cluster should be different than the miniball formed from the
valid returns. I suppose that again the neighborhood size probably needs to
be larger than or closely paired to the cluster size so that the enclosing
ball captures the bulk of the cluster.

You could compute each on a sample patch and then visualize the results
using CloudCompare or something that can handle extra dimensions to see if
you can get a feel for where to set those thresholds. I have a feeling that
in both cases you'll probably run into issues where you are also
obliterating sparse points that are more valid (water surface/shoreline,
building facades).

Finally, with the points being so far above ground, have you tried or
considered simply computing ground (or using existing classifications) and
computing AGL values (
https://pdal.io/stages/filters.html#height-above-ground). That would
probably easier when it comes to finding a suitable threshold.

Withheld is a flag, not a class. They would likely be both class 1 and
withheld. There should be a way to ignore withheld points.

Filters.dem is also a useful filter to removing some of this high noise https://pdal.io/stages/filters.dem.html

All?

 

I?m using USGS 3DEP point-clouds to generate surface-height rasters around Longmont, CO. The point-cloud files have spurious returns over many of the lakes/reservoirs in the area that are tagged other than 7 or 18. They?re streaks about 0.3 m long located 200+ m above the lake. In most cases the streak has 3?8 points, but I?ve found one with 34 points.

 

The outlier filter with statistical or radius methods doesn?t remove these longer streaks. Any recommendations on removing dense groups of points well separated from the main mass?

This seems to do the trick of removing isolated groups while leaving the main body of points alone, but I?m thinking these some other dimension that could be calculated and added to points then used to remove outlier groups later.

These both look great. I?ll run example data through them and inspect the new dimension in QGIS or CC.

The goal in all this is calculating a surface-height raster that will get combined with USGS terrain-height and NLCD category rasters for radio propagation calculations. Capturing building roofs is very important, but I can filter the side. I expect that tuning will be necessary based on the point density in the lidar collect.

I?ll always have a terrain raster for comparison, so this could work as well if I know the tallest building in advance.

Thanks,

Hi all.

Curious if there is any interest in supporting Leica PTX files in pdal. See more about the format here: http://paulbourke.net/dataformats/ptx/ . It?s a plain text format with one or more header:

number of columns
number of rows
st1 st2 st3 ; scanner registered position
sx1 sx2 sx3 ; scanner registered axis 'X'
sy1 sy2 sy3 ; scanner registered axis 'Y'
sz1 sz2 sz3 ; scanner registered axis 'Z'
r11 r12 r13 0 ; transformation matrix
r21 r22 r23 0 ; this is a simple rotation and translation 4x4 matrix
r31 r32 r33 0 ; just apply to each point to get the transformed coordinate
tr1 tr2 tr3 1 ; use double-precision variables

followed by X, Y, Z and optional Intensity, R, G and B data. Similar to PTS.

I?m pretty sure this is an old out of fashion format, not sure many people would get use out of it. But since there is a PTS reader already I thought I?d maybe ask around.

We had a request to support it in our application and I rolled my own simple PTX reader plugin. I would give it some minor code clean ups first, but I?m happy to pull request it. I don?t have a writer though unfortunately ?

Daniel,

We would be happy to merge a reader for this. Please make sure to include your excellent document and a some tests. A common test file we use is the 1.2-with-color.las file in the source tree if you have a convenient way to convert that to PTX.  

It would be too late to make the 2.4.0 release window, but it will be a nice inclusion for 2.5.0.

Thanks!

Howard

PTX files are still used pretty commonly by people working with tripod
scanner data so I think supporting them does offer some value.

That being said, the main reason for a user to choose PTX over PTS
would be to store structured data and to preserve scan level
transforms. Therefore, as a user, a PTX reader that simply converts
the scan to an unstructured point cloud and bakes in the transform is
much less useful than one that preserves that information. Pretty much
any software that supports exporting PTX will also support exporting
PTS, since they were basically intended as the structured and
unstructured variants of an ascii exchange format.

e57 has a similar dichotomy, even though in that case you can store
either structured or unstructured data inside the same file. One core
PDAL feature that would make both PTX and e57 support a lot more
useful for structured data would be to simply add rowIndex and
columnIndex dimensions. As a user being able to load structured data
into PDAL, do some stuff to it, then save out structured data would be
really useful. Even if PDAL filters continue to only operate on
unstructured data and simply pass through the array indexes so that
the arrays can be reassembled by the writers that would open up a lot
of potential workflows.

I could see how it would be useful for data formats with transforms built-in to push that information into stage metadata in a common way such that filters and writers can pick them up and use them. That could be obvious uses like filters.transformation. Multiplexing of transforms and positions from something like a single E57 file would seem out of scope for PDAL pipelines themselves, however.

Please make a PR to implement these.

As always, pull requests or funding can make these desires happen.

Hi all,

I've just made a release candidate for PDAL 2.4 available:

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/2.4.0RC1

Notable changes include support for the COPC file format and embedded LAS
compression with LAZperf (LASzip is no longer required or supported).

All?

I ran into PDAL crashes attempting to crop point clouds with my M1 Mac and started a thread on MacPorts:

https://trac.macports.org/ticket/64356 <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/64356>

The PDAL maintainer for that project traced the problem to a try/catch block:

https://trac.macports.org/ticket/64356#comment:18 <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/64356#comment:18>

Evidently exception handling works differently on an M1 Mac, resulting in the program failing when passed a 2D bounds.

Cheers,

Andreas

Andreas,

I ran the scenario linked on my osx-arm64 m1 machine without issue in Release or Debug mode for the PDAL 2.4.0 RC1. BTW, that scenario should not reproject the data to EPSG:4326. Do that as a post-process gdal_warp operation so that writers.gdal doesn't end up violating some assumptions you or it might have about square things.

I used Apple's compiler as well:

> Apple clang version 13.1.6 (clang-1316.0.21.2)


I'm not quite sure what the issue might be, but if you are able to test out the latest RC and still have the issue, please file a ticket with explicit details.

Howard

Howard,

I?m working on replicating the bug here. The version built by MacPorts exhibits it for 2.4.0 RC1.The version built by Homebrew doesn?t. Exception handling can get weird for reasons that I don?t understand.

> BTW, that scenario should not reproject the data to EPSG:4326. Do that as a post-process gdal_warp operation so that writers.gdal doesn't end up violating some assumptions you or it might have about square things.

Square is a slippery concept in geodata?a square in EPSG:4326 isn?t square in EPSG:5070 ?

Will converting to EPSG:4326 in PDAL cause problems if I want squares in EPSG:4326? I?m merging the output from PDAL with other geodata in EPSG:4326 and computing the crops to line up pixel boundaries across the products.

Cheers,

Andreas

Exception handling isn't "weird". The C++ language specifies exactly how it
works. If a program doesn't execute as specified by the program, there is a
bug in the compiler or the way that the application was built. There can be
errors in the code that lead to unexpected results during execution, but
undefined behavior is limited to specific cases documented in the language
specification.

Subject: [pdal] How to get las header info?
Message-ID: <11AF6E0C-4ABA-43AA-A700-12453DF53784@slu.se>

Dear list,

Previously, I could obtain a pdal::LasHeader through:

inline pdal::LasHeader get_header( const std::filesystem::path & path_ ) {
pdal::LasHeaderheader;
pdal::ILeStreaminput{ path_.native() };
input >> header;
return header;
}

But in the latest version of pdal the header copy constructor is implicitly deleted.

? What would be the correct way to obtain header info now? Specifically the bounding box?

I have a set of tools that initially used liblas to read and write files. These I have migrated into pdal plugins resulting in much simpler code. Some of my tools were no longer even needed since there were plugins that could be used instead. Thank you!

One tool I did not migrate. It calculates metrics (such as percentile 95 of all first returns etc.) for a number of randomly located circular areas. These areas can be located in any [small] subset of the 60.000 or so las-files that together cover the land area of Sweden. So most las-files can be ignored and I need a cheap way to obtain the bounding box of a file to determine if it can be ignored. I know that the header info is correct, as I have previously normalised the z-values through pdal.

? The best solution would be if I could migrate also this tool to a pdal plugin without loosing much efficiency. Any ideas?

The tool needs to process all las-files of a specified directory (and its sud-directories). If I need to read the contents of files that could actually be ignored, it would increase processing time probably tenfolds. Is there a way to avoid this?
    Maybe a previous stage in the pipeline to filter files based only on their header (bounding box) info?
    If I implement it as a streaming operation, could I get the bounding box from header info and possibly not stream anything?

Any suggestions are welcome.

This issue has already been reported and fixed and will be included in the
final 2.4 release:

 https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/3713

The bounding box of a LAS file is always stored at offsets 179-226, so you
can read them directly if you like, but as I said above, I have re-enabled
copying of LasHeader.

I saw your reply on the list archive. Thanks! I?ll try the 2.4 release.

If I?d try to migrate the tool to a pdal plugin ? is there a way to process a directory of files, to have them presented one by one to pdal::Filter::run or similar? Or how should I go about it?

Not really, no. Parallelism like that has always been out of scope for PDAL. Use your favorite parallel, bash, or xargs invocation to spray PDAL pipelines (or translates or whatever) across your directory of files.

If you must have a group of files (maybe you have neighborhood considerations or something), consider using a tile index similar to GDAL https://pdal.io/apps/tindex.html and have your reader work with those.

If your metrics tools are written in Python, you might consider using the filters.python stage to provide your logic to PDAL without having to jump to C++.

Thank you, Howard!

It looks very interesting, I will explore it!
(I don?t actually need parallelism, although that would have been a bonus. It is more that I aggregate certain data from them: processing all of them will result in only one file.)

Subject: [pdal] PDAL 2.4 Released
Message-ID: <CACJ51z3gprqKMg=j2w4VmKqJYT_-fFUw-ZLoq+t+RUE7MV2cFQ@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I have made version 2.4 of PDAL available for download:

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/2.4.0

It provides support for the COPC (https://github.com/copcio/copcio.github.io)
file format and also embeds lazperf for LAS compression. lazperf is
compatible with LASzip, which is no longer supported.

Documentations changes should appear soon.

A small change was made from the release candidate that may be of interest
to those using the API to access LAS files.
