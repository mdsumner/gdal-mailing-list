All,

I have issued PDAL 2.6.2 which is a maintenance release of the 2.6-maintenance branch. It fixes the compilation failure caused by libxml 2.12 and libunwind linking issues caused in some situations.

I wrote the following code to calculate point density. While it produces
results that have the correct spatial pattern, the absolute values appear
to be incorrect. The image is 3938 pixels by 3938 pixels and the mean pixel
value is 32.8, so the total number of points from the PDAL calculation is

3938*3938 * 32.8 = 483403808.8

but there are only 164022975 points in the original laz file, so the
estimate of 483403808.8 is just about 3 times larger than the number of
points in the las (2.947 top be exact)

Or have I misunderstood something?

count includes everything in the interpolation radius.

Use binmode=True on writers.gdal if you want the points only in the pixel. It is discussed in more detail in the docs at https://pdal.io/en/latest/stages/writers.gdal.html
