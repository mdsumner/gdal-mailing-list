Subject: [pdal] crop inside and outside
Message-ID: <5548EB75.9020908@esciencecenter.nl>

Hi,

I want to crop the points in a file that are inside a polygon (or 
bounding box) into a new file but also want to put the points outside in 
another file.

I guess i can do this with two runs of pdal pipeline (one with 
inside=true and other with false) but this means all the points are 
processed twice Is there a way to do it in a single run in a way that 
the input file does not need to be processed twice?

BTW, my end goal is to divide the file into parts according to a fixed 
grid so if someone knows a better way of achieving this let me know please.

Thanks a lot!

Regards,

Oscar

The new split command should be exactly what you want.

Thanks for the suggestion!

I looked at the splitter filter and it is not exactly what I want but I think it is easy to tweak it to do what I want to do so I will probably do it that way! I will share the tweak just in case somebody else want that...

As far as I understood from the code the Splitter filter make a grid of the input file so the cells coordinates depend on the extent of the file but in the grid that i want the extent of the cells depend on a global coordinates so I need to somehow pass the grid description to the splitter method. I think is easily doable, right?

Thanks again!

Regards,
O.

Subject: [pdal] PointView::dims()
Message-ID: <9A8E9C0EA026884EABE05D9840451395066B52FA@NBSVR-MAIL01.radiantblue.local>

I see the following inline definition in PointView.hpp:

    Dimension::IdList dims() const   { return m_pointTable.layout()->dims(); }

While in PointLayout, the dims list is returned as a const reference:

   const Dimension::IdList&  dims() const;

Is that intentional? I modified PointView.hpp in my workspace to mirror the underlying call's return type (namely, const IdList&) and PDAL compiled OK.
