All,

Ogi Moore from Hobu, Inc. and Mike Smith from USACE will be giving the PDAL Workshop [1] live and in person at FOSS4GNA [2] on October 23rd, 2023 in Baltimore, Maryland, USA. This will be the first time it has been given since 2019 at Bucharest FOSS4G. 

The workshop includes a number of updates from the OpenTopography team, the Hobu, Inc. internship team, and the PDAL developers to show how to use COPC, the new filters.expression, and view processed COPC content in QGIS. Attendees will receive a 32gb PDAL-branded USB-c drive with tons of example data and receive a coaster upon which to place your hacking support beverage of choice.

There are only 30 slots available, so hurry up and register for FOSS4GNA and the PDAL Workshop today!

Subject: [pdal] filtering LAS withheld points
Message-ID: <CADm=QrSr8bpuBvp7NXd4vtWOkcYE=SNt8xP4ez1L79tYNZaHwg@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to figure out how to filter out the withheld points in an LAS
file. I believe the withheld points should be ones where ClassFlags & 4 is
true. However, it looks like bitwise and is not supported in the Lexer.cpp
file. I was assuming that using filters.expression was the way to do this,
but is there another way that I'm missing?

Thanks,
