Subject: [pdal] Conda for official Mac/Windows PDAL packages?
Message-ID: <6D64DFF8-9EC4-488A-BD15-3C5CD0E68177@hobu.co>

All,

Brad's recently announced [1] Conda Forge packages for PDAL proved wildly successful for our recent FOSS4GNA workshop [2]. The current PDAL packaging story is rather messy, with OSGeo4W (64-bit only) available for Windows, Homebrew for OSX, and Debian/RedHat packages being provided by the distributions. Docker is also in the mix, although that's a separate thread 

The OSGeo4W package creation process is now fully automated through PDAL's AppVeyor continuous integration, but the upload, tagging, and release of the package is still a manual activity. OSGeo4W can also be very brittle for people, especially as an installation, and it often lacks the refresh of underlying system support packages on which everything is based. 

Homebrew PDAL packages for OSX are also available, but they are only available to 1.6 and installations can be fickle, especially when it comes to updating. 

The appeal of Conda Forge as a packager is a single upstream for packaging efforts, a build system that doesn't require our project to maintain it (currently done with OSGeo4W), and convenient usability of the packages for the users.  Another strong appeal of Conda Forge is the workflow of package creation, changes, patches, and refresh can be done through typical pull-request workflow. OSGeo4W updates require SSH access to a machine (that is sometimes down), and manual button mashing with careful manual post validation.

I'm proposing that we drop the OSGeo4W and Homebrew package support in exchange for the Conda Forge ecosystem. I'm interested in hearing from users of the Homebrew and OSGeo4W packages on that topic, however. Would this drastically upend your workflow? Make things simpler? If these packaging approaches are critical for you, can you step forward to take over their care with some hand-off? 

If there's no significant objection, PDAL 1.8 will target Conda as the primary packaging environment for Mac/Windows.

Howard,

As a user of both OS X, Windows and occasionally PDAL, I would welcome such a change. As a user I find both Homebrew and OSGeo4W less than optimal. Homebrew is generally a nice environment but it has proven difficult to maintain the various OSGeo packages in a way that is easily compatible with the core homebrew set of packages.
As a developer/maintainer I unfortunately find OSGeo4W very fragile at the moment. Primarily because of the few people who are actively maintaining it (it is more or less a one person operation it seems). On top of that it is very difficult to be a "drive-by" contributor because ultimately SSH access is required. Homebrew works fairly well from a maintainer perspective, but when it comes to the OSGeo packages it is still problematic.

The conda forge ecosystem removes all of the above problems and in my experience everything just works. Both from a user and maintainer perspective. So for what it's worth, a +1 from me.

As a python user under windows, I much prefer a Conda solution over
OSGeo4w. Thank you for all your work

Hi all

To echo Kristian and speaking from a MacOS perspective I’ve found homebrew
pretty painful for managing packages - so I’m really happy to see a
convenient conda build approach.

+1

And thanks!!!

hmmmm... I'm really fine with conda package but especially because I'm a
linux user and there I can use a single interpreter... but what is the case
in win? If I want to share my env and data with a qgis python env, this
wouldn't be possibile.

so, I'm for a -1, sorry

Hi,
I am using pdal in python environment in windows 7.
I have a shapefile which consists of several hundreds of polygons. I converted the shapefile to geojson and trying to clip each polygon and write it to a separate LAS file.the following is code for clipping polygon with ID=6. However, I do not know how to loop within the pipeline and clip from polygon 1 to 200 and have 200 outputs with correct naming.
{  "pipeline":[
    {        "type":"readers.las",        "filename":"input.las"                   },
    {      "type":"filters.overlay",      "dimension":"Intensity",      "datasource":"map.vrt",      "layer":"OGRGeoJSON",      "column":"ID"    },
    {      "type":"filters.range",      "limits":"Intensity[6:6]"    },
        "output_6.las"  ]}'''

Thank you!

The problem has been that QGIS controls the Python environment with OSGeo4W and makes everyone conform to it. With OSGeo4W becoming more difficult in both the packaging and use directions, it is time to reevaluate that position. OSGeo4W is a poor replication of the Conda environment at the moment and diverging rapidly.

It is worth noting that there is a qgis conda package, but I'm sure it
needs some work to make it usable. I have no idea how much effort that
would take, and I'm guessing it's too large a ship to try to turn in any
official capacity.

Message-ID: <HE1PR03MB13381379BFB2BC538487AD36CA640@HE1PR03MB1338.eurprd03.prod.outlook.com>

Hello,

Does pdal have any plans to support laz compression for pgpointcloud writer? This compression type is support by PostGIS pgpointcloud extension.

The source code does define a compression type enumerator named "lazperf" (compression.hpp). However the pgwriter class does not implement a solution for this compression type. Actually tried using pdal with compression set to use "laszperf" which resultet in pdal using none which was confussing. The PgWriter::SetupSchema method handles lazperf as none instead of giving an error message.

kind regards, Lars

This has been broken from the beginning - there is no compression support
at all despite advertising it. I don't know the history. It predates my
involvement.

If you'd like to make a pull request with some code, that would be great.

Andrew,

Just to make sure I understand this, you are saying that pgpointcloud does not support laz compression?

I am sure you know this but pgpointcloud must be built with LAZPERF enable in order to work.

Do you know if a pgpointcloud ticket has been created for this problem?

kind regards, Lars

Perhaps I misspoke. PDAL does no compression for pgpointcloud.  Perhaps
postgres does compression on its own.  We do set "dimensional" or "ght"
compression types in the pointcloud schema if they're set as options. We do
nothing with lazperf WRT pgpointcloud.

Andrew ,

The below is from pgpointcloud documentation and it appears pgpointcloud handles compression stuff. So if PDAL could set lazperf compression type in schema, it might work 😊

"If you are writing your own loading system and want to write into Pointcloud types, create well-known binary inputs, in uncompressed format. If you schema indicates that your patch storage is compressed, Pointcloud will automatically compress your patch before storing it, so you can create patches in uncompressed WKB without worrying about the nuances of particular internal compression schemes."

I've opened the following ticket to address the issue:

Andrew ,

The below is from pgpointcloud documentation and it appears pgpointcloud handles compression stuff. So if PDAL could set lazperf compression type in schema, it might work 😊

"If you are writing your own loading system and want to write into Pointcloud types, create well-known binary inputs, in uncompressed format. If you schema indicates that your patch storage is compressed, Pointcloud will automatically compress your patch before storing it, so you can create patches in uncompressed WKB without worrying about the nuances of particular internal compression schemes."

Perhaps I misspoke. PDAL does no compression for pgpointcloud.  Perhaps postgres does compression on its own.  We do set "dimensional" or "ght" compression types in the pointcloud schema if they're set as options. We do nothing with lazperf WRT pgpointcloud.

Andrew,

Just to make sure I understand this, you are saying that pgpointcloud does not support laz compression?

I am sure you know this but pgpointcloud must be built with LAZPERF enable in order to work.

Do you know if a pgpointcloud ticket has been created for this problem?

kind regards, Lars

Hello,

Does pdal have any plans to support laz compression for pgpointcloud writer? This compression type is support by PostGIS pgpointcloud extension.

This has been broken from the beginning - there is no compression support at all despite advertising it. I don't know the history. It predates my involvement.

If you'd like to make a pull request with some code, that would be great.

Subject: [pdal] Recommendations for a LiDAR classification editor
Message-ID: <CAAuwKSwxY4ewn6s5-t9k8uNaY1ENtw_E0H=9Fgqb89KXfc-bzw@mail.gmail.com>

I am working on a PDAL pipeline that contains a SVM classifier for railroad
beds that will be published to https://github.com/PDAL/pipelines

I am using CloudCompare to edit the raw LiDAR assigning classifications for
the training dataset.

My question is, what are other recommendations for 3D point cloud editors?
In that QGIS has a 2D editing environment I find that to be difficult to
work with.

I'm not too sure what the most convenient 3D point cloud editor is at
the moment. I never edit them :)

I know lasview has some editing capability. 3D point cloud editing is
not a workflow the open source community has really focused upon.
