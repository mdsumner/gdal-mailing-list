Subject: [pdal] Simple ply / decimate pipeline not streaming
Message-ID: <CAEJvSPKph295UCGK1ErTYL3-mr+mjwtbL4hnebYEfyyQ59o-1g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I am new to pdal (using Docker's pdal/pdal:1.8, specifically
pdal/pdal at sha256:12d0b90af6d2056467cff77509ba44878661a12217819c8af1eb91b3fda490e2).
I've tried a very simple pipeline (attached) which, from my reading of the
documentation, should support streaming: it reads from a .PLY file, uses
the decimation filter with a "step" of 8, and writes to another .PLY file.

https://pdal.io/stages/readers.ply.html
https://pdal.io/stages/writers.ply.html
https://pdal.io/stages/filters.decimation.html

All three stages say they support streaming operations.

However, when I run the pipeline, the process runs out of memory, and
validating the pipeline shows it is not streaming:

{
   "error_detail" : "",
   "streamable" : false,
   "valid" : true
}

What am I missing? Is there a way to further debug this (e.g. identify
which part of the pipeline inhibits streaming)? Would anyone care to
enlighten me?

Thank you,

Tom

Hi,

i'm sorry, but in this case the documentation is in error.  The PLY writer
doesn't support streaming mode.  I'll fix the documentation shortly.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL 1.8.0: filters.smrf: No returns to process.
Message-ID: <MWHPR04MB0401643EAB7CD4B04133D214B09D0@MWHPR04MB0401.namprd04.prod.outlook.com>

Hi List,


I've be running into some trouble getting filters.smrf to run on a LAS file on pdal 1.8.0 (OS X brew install).


Running the following command:


pdal pipeline denoise_classify_sample9_1ft.json \

--readers.las.filename=Day_5/TrackZ_S_20181014_183948_Profiler.zfs_7.las \

--writers.las.filename=ALL_LAS/Day_5/TrackZ_S_20181014_183948_Profiler.zfs_7_smrf_9.las


fails to write a point cloud and reports the following:


PDAL: filters.smrf: No returns to process.


I have run this same command on another machine that has pdal 1.7.2 (OS X brew install) which successfully completes and writes the resulting point cloud as expected.


I'm wondering if anyone may have any pointers regarding how I might get filters.smrf to run in 1.8.0. on these data.  Incidentally, I have been able to successfully apply the same json file to airborne las data in 1.8.0.  I'm somewhat confused about what might be the issue with the point cloud file in 1.8 where it fails versus 1.7.2 where the file processes correctly.


Contents of the json file follow:


{
"pipeline": [
{
"type" : "readers.las",
"filename" : "file.las"
},
{
"type":"filters.assign",
"assignment" : "Classification[0:20]=0"
},
{
"type": "filters.outlier",
"method": "statistical",
"multiplier":4,
"mean_k": 12
},
{
"type":"filters.smrf",
"cell":1.00,
"scalar":0.0,
"slope":0.06,
"threshold":1.05,
"window":49.0,
"cut":0.0
},
{
"type": "writers.las",
"compression": "false",
"a_srs": "EPSG:6531+6360",
"minor_version": "2",
"forward": "all",
"filename":"outfile.las"
}
]
}


Thanks for any assistance in this matter.

Robert,

Does the input have return information (number, etc.)? If it does, but
there are no last or only returns for some reason, then smrf would have
nothing to work with. There is a workaround if that's the case.

Are you running with '--verbose 5'? I think that should give you some
information as to how many points are making it to smrf from earlier
stages. I didn't see anything that would cause them to be dropped on their
way, but who knows.

Brad

I suspect you've encountered a bug that was fixed after version 1.8 was
released:

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2275

If this looks like your issue, you'll have to build from source or use one
of our docker builds.  The only other thing I can think of is that changes
were made to the options for the smrf filter between version 1.7 and 1.8.
You should review the documentation to be sure that you're using the
options for the 1.8 version of the filter.

Best,

Thanks Andrew and Brad,


The point cloud dimension NumberOfReturns was 0 so I was able to get filters.smrf running under 1.8.0 now by setting the NumberOfReturns in the json file to 1.


        {

          "type":"filters.assign",

          "assignment" : "NumberOfReturns[0:0]=1"

        },


Thanks for pointing me to the issue on this topic.


Take care.


Rob

There is now a C API for PDAL available at https://github.com/PDAL/CAPI.
The API exposes PDAL's JSON pipeline functionality just like the Python and
Java bindings available at GitHub. Take a look at the tests for examples on
how to use the API.

A "pdal-c" package is also available for vcpkg and a conda-forge package is
on its way. I hope that this library serves as a useful FFI for other
language bindings. Please submit an issue or pull request at GitHub if you
have any suggestions. Your help will be much appreciated.

Hello,
i am struggling with a export from postgres to a laz file. I seem to be

Jaime,

This opens things up for people looking to do FFI activities with PDAL, and it is something that has been asked about for a number of years.

Thanks for the excellent contribution!
