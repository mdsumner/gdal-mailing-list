Subject: [pdal] Offset, rotate and convert a las dataset
Message-ID: <CAM6UruGPQE9Ng8dLs7Ze+Rr2PcqXFD_fc5KvaWNwT_xvB3H33w@mail.gmail.com>

I realize this is probably a big ask, but any advice would be welcome. I
have a .las dataset ('driveway.las') that was produced by a Livox
solid-state LiDAR sensor <https://www.livoxtech.com/mid-40-and-mid-100>.
The relevant portion of the lasinfo command:

Header Summary
---------------------------------------------------------
  Version:                     1.2
  Number of Point Records:     2049000
  Compressed:                  False
  Number of Points by Return:  0 0 0 0 0
  Scale Factor X Y Z:          0.00100000000000 0.00100000000000
0.00100000000000
  Offset X Y Z:                0.000 0.000 0.000
  Min X Y Z:                   0.000 -28410.000 -2096.000
  Max X Y Z:                   114446.000 15231.000 30371.000
  Spatial Reference:           None

The Livox sensor was pointing west, so what I'd like to do is rotate/offset
the las 90 degrees clockwise around a 0,0,0 point of -12472675,3936612,1402
(EPSG:3857), and finally assign the EPSG:3857 coordinate reference system
to the transformed las. Then as a final step, I want to convert the
transformed las to an ept dataset.

Ideally, I'd like to be provided with the PDAL pipeline json that would do
all this. Understanding that this is a downright lazy request, perhaps
someone could outline the pipeline steps that would perform my
transformation/conversion for me to start from.

Many thanks to any responders.

Hi Rudy,

You should look at https://pdal.io/stages/filters.transformation.html. I
think you'd usually do a translation to the origin you desire, followed by
a rotation, followed by the inverse translation -- you can chain three
transformation filters to do this.

Andrew, that does indeed get me on the right path. I'll post a summary of
my workflow when I have it working, if that is appropriate for this group.

Rudy

You will actually find the answer in the data ingestion app that I sent you
before.

the pipeline I used there looked something like:

[
  {
      "type": "filters.transformation",
      "matrix": "cos -sin 0 0 sin cos 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1"
   },
   {
      "type": "filters.projpipeline",
      "coord_op": "+proj=affine +xoff=xoff-value +yoff=yoff-value
+zoff=zoff-value"
    }
]

where you replace cos and sin with then cosine and sine of the relevant
bearing angle and xoff-value etc with the 3857 coords off the origin
