Subject: [pdal] PDAL installation on OSGeo4W
Message-ID: <CANY3h+Q4FVmPXtvBHLNQ-gGE4==YPo3EqJhgHQ-jZWmw_R=+zw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Not sure if this is the right place to share, but I have been using PDAL on
OSGeo4W.
I followed the installation instructions at
https://pdal.io/workshop/osgeo4w.html
Recently I got a colleague to also download OSGeo4W to use PDAL.
It installed but when they used PDAL in the OSGeo4W Shell they got an error
saying gdal203dll was missing.
I looked at the dependencies for the PDAL package installation and it is
installing gdal202dll but not gdal203dll.
Is this a new dependency? As I didn't have this issue when I installed
earlier in the year.
Thanks in advance.
Rebecca

Forgot to add that we easily resolved this by installing the package
containing the missing dll, but it would have been good to have that
package marked as a dependency so it was flagged at the time of PDAL
installation.

as far as I know osgeo4w packaging has been dismissed (or not maintained
and updated) in favour of conda package, probably you still have PDAL 1.8
or 1.9 version in osgeo4w.

Note that OSGeo4W is not listed on the PDAL downloads page:
https://pdal.io/download.html#binaries
It is not even mentioned anywhere on the website
https://pdal.io/search.html?q=osgeo4w

I had come across this page through google
https://pdal.io/workshop/osgeo4w.html and had been following these
instructions.
I can see now that it was for version 1.8.0.
I will go back to the drawing board and look into conda.
Thanks everyone.

I think this is a legacy page dangling in the archive on the server.
If you click the parent node titled "Software Installation",
i.e. https://pdal.io/workshop/software.html
you will notice the OSGeo4W disappears from the table of contents
and only Conda is listed.

or even 1.5 (two years old).

Rebecca,

OSGeo4W is no longer the prescribed way to get PDAL on Windows. As Mat said, you should look to Conda now for that. 

It seems our stale documentation is still online about OSGeo4W. I'll make a pass through to clean things up.

Thanks for the report.

Howard

Hi fellow PDAL'ers

So after my post last week about OSGeo4W I reverted to Conda and I'm no
longer getting the results I was getting in OSGeo4W. I would love some help
troubleshooting as I feel like I'm overlooking something but not sure what.

I am doing a reprojection on a las file. When I run this command in the
pdal version i have in OSGeo4W a file is created and the Z values have been
correctly reprojected. When I run the exact same command in the conda
environment, I get a file with data in it, but there has been no
change/shift to the Z value.

OSGeo4W pdal version is 1.8.0
Conda pdal version is 2.0.1

This is the command:

pdal pipeline "C:/Rebecca/las/pipeline.json"
--readers.las.filename="C:/Rebecca/las/BD38_5k_0201.las"
--writers.las.filename="C:/Rebecca/las/BD38_5k_0201_NZVD2016.las"
--filters.reprojection.out_srs="+init=EPSG:2193
+geoidgrids=C:/Rebecca/las/moturiki-1953-to-nzvd2016-conversion.gtx"

This is the contents of pipeline.json:

{
    "pipeline" :
    [
        {
            "type":"readers.las",
            "filename":"#"
        },
        {
            "type":"filters.reprojection",
            "in_srs":"EPSG:2193",
            "out_srs":"EPSG:2193"
        },
        {
            "type":"writers.las",
            "filename":"#",
            "a_srs":"EPSG:2193",
            "forward":"all"
        }
    ]
}


These are the packages which I installed in the conda environment after
creation: pdal, python-pdal, gdal

Would love any help.

Thanks in advance.

Rebecca

I suspect you also need to install the proj-datumgrid package for conda

> conda install -c conda-forge proj-datumgrid-oceania proj-datumgrid-world

This should get you the grid shift files that OSGeo4W packages for you.
Please file a ticket in the PDAL repository on this topic. We need to
update our documentation to note this item if users expect to do any
geodetic shift operations.

Hi Howard,

Thanks for the quick reply I installed these packages and it didn't fix the
problem.
I'm specifying the grid shift file with the +geoidgrids.
I noticed on the PROJ site there was a bug fix in Sept 2019 that mentions
geoidgrids, maybe that could be what's causing the issue here, but I need
to investigate that further to understand it.

Thanks
Rebecca

The bug fix they are referring to (which was actually May 2019 not Sept
2019, my bad)  has something to do with grids not being picked up, which
feels like what's happening here.
Ticket raised https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2779

Subject: [pdal] Y_scale issue for LAS file
Message-ID: <5da560b0.1c69fb81.22cc4.5f97@mx.google.com>

Hello,
I am having troubles with a LAS file dataset. When I run the SORT filter in pipeline mode, I get the following message:

PDAL: writers.las: Unable to convert scaled value (2663397360) to int32 for dimension 'Y' when writing LAS/LAZ file \\sfcad8\E\16028101_PowerEngineers_TWE\NVE\00_SORTED\pt000002.las.

And the resulting LAS file are empty (1 KB size)

The X, Y, Z scales for the LAS dataset is “0.10000000000000000555”.

I have run exactly the same filter on other datasets and it worked just fine. However, the other datasets where in a different projection.

Any idea why PDAL is throwing this message and writing no points to the resulting LAS file?

Regards,

Miguel

PDAL writes LAS with scale of .01 by default (see
https://pdal.io/stages/writers.las.html).  I assume that using more
precision than your input would cause an overflow that's detected by the
system.  You should set the output scale that you desire.

Thanks Andrew!
You were right. I applied the scale obtained from the LAS header and I am
getting good results.
I am not sure if you have the answer for this one but, why are the
resulting LAS files (after sorting) a little bit bigger in size than the
originals?

Once again thanks for your help.

Miguel

I have no way of knowing without more information.  Assuming the point
format/version is the same on input and output, different VLRs would
account for a change in size.

Man, two out of two!
Thanks again. The original data was in LAS version 1.0 and the resulting
LAS files are in 1.2.

Regards,

Miguel
