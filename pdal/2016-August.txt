Subject: [pdal] Pointcloud writer not available
Message-ID: <CAEMWU2_64gFKZP+rQVj_r+tX3YGRuRNLP7Fb7eipgYNHjEPKRg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Just got a new machine for work, I downloaded the latest 64-bit osgeo4w
installer and installed my usual suite of stuff (PDAL, PCL, QGIS, etc) and
all dependencies. For some reason, when I type pdal --drivers in the
osgeo4w command line (using admin privileges), writers.pointcloud is
missing. Other writers missing are nitf, p2g, pcd, pclvisualiser, sqlite.
This was working for us previously, both machines have windows 7 and
similar configurations.

Am I missing something obvious? pdal --version gives 1.1.0 (git-version:
64ca76) on both machines.

I tried searching and found things related to this problem (namely related
to paths) but this used to work flawlessly (older machine was installed in
early 2016) and now doesn`t which is puzzling.

The most likely issue is PDAL_DRIVER_PATH isn't set, or it isn't pointing at C:\osgeo4w64\bin

Note that we aren't really keeping the Windows binaries up-to-date anymore because of the effort required to do so. The best way to use PDAL on Windows with the most up-to-date software (without building it yourself) is to use the Docker builds. This especially true now that Docker on Windows is rapidly improving.

See the Quickstart http://www.pdal.io/quickstart.html and Workshop Installation documents http://www.pdal.io/workshop/docker.html for background on how to get going with it.

Thanks for the quick reply! Yes, I figured from the previous discussions
that a pathing issue is occuring.

We love docker and work with it, the only issue I have to research is that
we use Python scripts to call pdal via osgeo command line to insert point
clouds in our database using pgpointcloud writer.

We work in precision forestry so we have software that segments tree crowns
from lidar data. We then extract the point cloud for each individual tree
using the segmented vector tree crown shapes  Many metrics and features are
calculated and tagged to the crown (this is what the Python script that
creates the PDAL pipeline does) and then injected into the postgres
database, so they can be found in the database later.

We have not found a way (yet!) to interface via Docker the same way eg.
Call a pdal command line via docker from a Python script.

Everything would be much easier on Linux but I do not make that call!

Thanks for your help.

It should be possible and straightforward to do this. I know some on this list are doing exactly that (running pdal docker containers and interacting with data on the host via mapped volumes), though they are using Linux as the Docker host.  The PDAL Workshop on the website demonstrates how to run PDAL commands on Windows hosts in a number of scenarios.

Going forward, the current PDAL development team is not likely to keep Windows builds via OSGeo4W on par with the public Docker builds. The Docker builds are automatically generated as new commits are made to the current maintenance branch (right now this is 1.2-maintenance and the pdal/pdal:1.2 image).

However, PDAL's test suite is built and run on Windows with most commits to the repository, and a zip file of the resulting successful build against current OSGeo4W64 is available for you to hand jam from https://s3.amazonaws.com/pdal/osgeo4w/pdal.zip It's not tied to specific releases, and it is bound to whatever was current for OSGeo4W64 when the build was made, but some may find it useful.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL 1.3.0RC1 Released
Message-ID: <6770EDF4-3FDA-4166-BE49-D4708F6F4B34@hobu.co>

It is my pleasure to announce the release of PDAL 1.3.0RC1. After hearing from packagers and any other testers, we will promote it to final sometime next week if there are no significant issues found. Obtain it from the following download locations:

http://download.osgeo.org/pdal/PDAL-1.3.0RC1-src.tar.bz2
http://download.osgeo.org/pdal/PDAL-1.3.0RC1-src.tar.bz2.md5
http://download.osgeo.org/pdal/PDAL-1.3.0RC1-src.tar.gz
http://download.osgeo.org/pdal/PDAL-1.3.0RC1-src.tar.gz.md5

The 1.3.0 release brings the following updates, enhancements and fixes:

- Command line parsing has been reworked to cause invalid options to emit an error message.  Stage options specified in pipelines and on the command line are handled similarly.
- The dimension PlatformHeading has been renamed to Azimuth.  When looking up a dimension by name, the string "platformheading" is still accepted and returns Azimuth.
- Errors detected by GDAL are no longer thrown as exceptions.  A log message is emitted instead.
- Well-known dimensions are now added to PDAL by editing a JSON file, Dimension.json.
- Linking with PDAL using CMake no longer requires explicit linking with curl, jsoncpp or arbiter libraries.
- PDAL now searches for plugins in the following locations and order by default: ./lib, ../lib, ../bin, the location where PDAL was installed.
- The '--debug' and '--verbose' options are no longer supported as stage options.  The '--verbose' option is accepted on the PDAL command line.  The '--debug' option is deprecated, and if specified on the command line is equivalent to '--verbose=3'.  One can enable logging programmatically by calling setLog() on a PipelineManager or a specific stage.
- pdal::Dimension types are now  C++11 enumeration classes. The change may require editing any Stage implementations you might have and removing the extraneous ::Enum type specification.

Enhancements:

- Pipelines can now be read directly from standard input.
- Files can now be read from Amazon S3 buckets by providing an appropriate URL.
- Many new filters have been added: filters.approximatecoplanar, filters.eigenvalues, filters.estimaterank, filters.hag, filters.normal, filters.outlier, filters.pmf, filters.sample.  Most of these are algorithm extractions from the PCL library, with the hope of eliminating the need for PCL in some future PDAL release.
- The PLY reader now loads dimensions that aren't predefined PDAL dimensions.
- A '--driver' option has been added to allow a specific driver to be loaded for a file without regard to its extension.
- The PDAL_DRIVER_PATH environment variable now accepts a list of locations to search for drivers.
- Beta release quality drivers improvements in readers.greyhound
- Beta quality implementation of Mongus and Zalik ground filter
- Experimental implementation of Pingel et al. ground filter
- writers.pcd enhancements by Logan Byers (binary, compression) -- requires PCL
- Docker images upgraded to Ubuntu Xenial
- Cyclone PTS reader -- readers.pts
- skewness, kurtosis, stddev, and variance added to filters.stats output
- Python API now available https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdal

Fixes:

- A failure that may have resulted when using filters.hexbin to calculate density in the southern hemisphere has been corrected.
- A failure to create the index file with 'pdal tindex' and GDAL 2.X has been fixed.
- The '--tindex' option for the 'pdal tindex' command is now a positional option as specified in the documentation.
- The icebridge reader now reads the X dimension as longitude and forces the value in the range (-180, 180].  It also properly uses the dimension Azimuth instead of ScanAngleRank.
- An error in writers.pgpointcloud where it ignored SQL to be run at the end of the stage has been fixed.
- An error that might incorrectly write values stored internally as bytes when written as a different data type has been fixed.
- A problem where 'pdal info' wouldn't properly report dimension names not predefined by PDAL has been fixed.
- A bug in filters.crop that wouldn't properly transform coordinates when provided the '--a_srs' option has been fixed.

If I can make a request, please remove the version from the vendor 
subdirectories.

It makes license and copyright review of those subtrees extremely 
unpleasant because all the files have changed not only those were 
actually modified between the versions included in PDAL.

Kind Regards,

Would it be sufficient to do that for the 1.4 release, or would you like it to happen to 1.3?

Also, did PDAL pass Debian's package testing scenarios? Can you post the link?

Thanks so much,

Yes, that would suffice. I've already finished the review for 1.3 which 
took a considerable amount of time because of this issue, renaming now 
just adds to the burden in a short a amount of time.

> Also, did PDAL pass Debian's package testing scenarios? Can you post the link?

The testsuite passed for my build, but because of the SONAME bump the 
upload to experimental will need to pass the NEW queue before being 
accepted into the archive. Once there the other QA tests like piuparts 
will pick it up.

The package tracker is the best place to find the relevant links for the 
package in Debian:

  https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/pdal

packages.debian.org is more user oriented.

Kind Regards,

Bas

For your convenience, a full-featured PDAL is also available via Docker which includes nearly all drivers. This is the easiest way to get going with PDAL. Additionally, whenever a push is made by the development team to the PDAL 1.3-maintenance branch, the Docker image will be automatically updated.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL 1.3.0 Released
Message-ID: <B1BA1FC9-39BA-413E-BAE9-118B594E525D@hobu.co>

After a few small updates found in RC1 by Sebastiaan, PDAL 1.3.0 is now released. You can download it from the website at http://www.pdal.io/download.html#download or obtain it via Docker (see Quickstart for details http://www.pdal.io/quickstart.html )

Thanks to everyone who has helped make this release including Andrew Bell, Brad Chambers, Sebastiaan Couwenberg, Logan Beyers, Connor Manning, Pete Gadomski, Mateusz Loskot, Mike Smith and others for bug reports, pull requests, tickets, and data verification. 

> The 1.3.0 release brings the following updates, enhancements and fixes:
> 
> - Command line parsing has been reworked to cause invalid options to emit an error message.  Stage options specified in pipelines and on the command line are handled similarly.
> - The dimension PlatformHeading has been renamed to Azimuth.  When looking up a dimension by name, the string "platformheading" is still accepted and returns Azimuth.
> - Errors detected by GDAL are no longer thrown as exceptions.  A log message is emitted instead.
> - Well-known dimensions are now added to PDAL by editing a JSON file, Dimension.json.
> - Linking with PDAL using CMake no longer requires explicit linking with curl, jsoncpp or arbiter libraries.
> - PDAL now searches for plugins in the following locations and order by default: ./lib, ../lib, ../bin, the location where PDAL was installed.
> - The '--debug' and '--verbose' options are no longer supported as stage options.  The '--verbose' option is accepted on the PDAL command line.  The '--debug' option is deprecated, and if specified on the command line is equivalent to '--verbose=3'.  One can enable logging programmatically by calling setLog() on a PipelineManager or a specific stage.
> - pdal::Dimension types are now  C++11 enumeration classes. The change may require editing any Stage implementations you might have and removing the extraneous ::Enum type specification.
> 
> Enhancements:
> 
> - Pipelines can now be read directly from standard input.
> - Files can now be read from Amazon S3 buckets by providing an appropriate URL.
> - Many new filters have been added: filters.approximatecoplanar, filters.eigenvalues, filters.estimaterank, filters.hag, filters.normal, filters.outlier, filters.pmf, filters.sample.  Most of these are algorithm extractions from the PCL library, with the hope of eliminating the need for PCL in some future PDAL release.
> - The PLY reader now loads dimensions that aren't predefined PDAL dimensions.
> - A '--driver' option has been added to allow a specific driver to be loaded for a file without regard to its extension.
> - The PDAL_DRIVER_PATH environment variable now accepts a list of locations to search for drivers.
> - Beta release quality drivers improvements in readers.greyhound
> - Beta quality implementation of Mongus and Zalik ground filter
> - Experimental implementation of Pingel et al. ground filter
> - writers.pcd enhancements by Logan Byers (binary, compression) -- requires PCL
> - Docker images upgraded to Ubuntu Xenial
> - Cyclone PTS reader -- readers.pts
> - skewness, kurtosis, stddev, and variance added to filters.stats output
> - Python API now available https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdal
> 
> Fixes:
> 
> - A failure that may have resulted when using filters.hexbin to calculate density in the southern hemisphere has been corrected.
> - A failure to create the index file with 'pdal tindex' and GDAL 2.X has been fixed.
> - The '--tindex' option for the 'pdal tindex' command is now a positional option as specified in the documentation.
> - The icebridge reader now reads the X dimension as longitude and forces the value in the range (-180, 180].  It also properly uses the dimension Azimuth instead of ScanAngleRank.
> - An error in writers.pgpointcloud where it ignored SQL to be run at the end of the stage has been fixed.
> - An error that might incorrectly write values stored internally as bytes when written as a different data type has been fixed.
> - A problem where 'pdal info' wouldn't properly report dimension names not predefined by PDAL has been fixed.
> - A bug in filters.crop that wouldn't properly transform coordinates when provided the '--a_srs' option has been fixed.

Has the new version also been uploaded to PyPI already?
The Python bindings are not available there yet.

Kind Regards,

Refreshed. https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdal

I will update the release procedures for next time.

Thanks,

You did that for 1.2.0 already:

$ tail -1 HOWTORELEASE.txt
11) Upload Python extension to PyPI

Maybe make it a bit prominent, or a post-release skip that checks the 
availability on the various download locations?

Kind Regards,

Bas

hehe. Of course I didn't follow my own procedure(s) to the end...
