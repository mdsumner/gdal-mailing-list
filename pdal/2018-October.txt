Subject: [pdal] read scalar field as intensity in reader.ply
Message-ID: <BYAPR01MB42785DD3258089AD20592C78F5EB0@BYAPR01MB4278.prod.exchangelabs.com>

is it possible to read a custom scalar field into the intensity dimension?

in my case, the output from our scanner includes a "gray" scalar value (binary .ply format) that is actually intensity. i would like to map it into the intensity dimension for processing.

see this discussion surrounding lastools :

You can't do this directly with a command-line option, but there are
alternatives:

1) The header of a PLY file is ASCII text.  You can simply change the name
of the field that's called "gray" (or whatever) to "Intensity".
2) You can add a ferry filter after the ply reader in your pipeline to copy
the data from the gray field to the Intensity field.  If you're using "pdal
translate", you can add the ferry filter to the process by using `-f ferry
--filters.ferry.dimensions "gray=>Intensity"

Hi,

What is happening with AppVeyor builds?
Is this planned/expected situation for the time being?

If not, what's the problem, how can I help?

Mat,


I pushed a fix that got AppVeyor building again. The Python3 package was
changed from 3.6 to 3.7 underneath us, and we needed to update our
configuration to match.


https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hobu/pdal/builds/19559423


There's a bunch of failures that look real now after that patch.


https://ci.appveyor.com/project/hobu/pdal/builds/19559423#L5667 It looks
like PROJ was updated in OSGeo4W and we need to adapt on that topic now
too.

Post 1.8, we're moving to Conda for AppVeyor and binary distribution to
get much more control over this mess. This doesn't help us at this
moment though.

Howard,

OSGeo4W now includes a legacy version of PROJ (4.9.3). You may be able to use that in the short term until you move over to the Conda configuration.

Howard,
Thanks for the update.
I think the AppVeyor has got fixed now, at leats the tests I'm
interested in are built and run.

Subject: [pdal] LNK2019 for PDAL with Arbiter and static cURL
Message-ID: <CABUeae-3xGuZbZDuypQMB5TR0B_3qkBb4F+G5q8sOK4AJOSM3g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Today I enountered a problem while building PDAL with
cURL enabled using VS2017 on Windows.

Everything compiled, but I got a bunch of linker errors
LNK2019 unresolved external symbol
for cURL's calls being unresolved and referenced by arbiter.

BTW, static built libcurl.lib I passed to CMake was passed to linker.

The workaround that worked for me was to edit vendor/arbiter/arbiter.hpp
and add #define CURL_STATICLIB in here:

#ifdef ARBITER_CURL
#define CURL_STATICLIB
#include <curl/curl.h>
#else
typedef void CURL;
#endif

Has anyone experienced that?

There seem to be no CMake option or define expected by
either PDAL or Arbiter to tell those to use static cURL
and stick the CURL_STATICLIB define before curl.h include.

There seem to be nothing related to use of static cURL
in the docs or AppVeyor scripts.

Best regards,

I don't think anyone has cared about linking curl as a static lib.  We also
haven't supported VS 2017 unless you're building it yourself.  I think
you're on your own on this one.

Yes, I build libcurl myself.

No problem, I can manage it.
In fact, PDAL builds with VS2017 fine.

I just wanted to confirm I am not missing anything related to libcurl
for PDAL or Arbiter.

any press release to spread on social media? would be fine to have more

We are moving away from uploading the tarball to the OSGeo download
server. We are not an OSGeo project and getting credentials for new
contributors to be able to upload to that single server is challenging.
We will post 1.8 final release at that location. Moving forward we are
planning to use GitHub Releases unless someone else can suggest a more
convenient mechanism. Andrew has coordinated the entire PDAL 1.8 release
cycle, and we are working to eliminate bottlenecks in the process. I am
a bottleneck for the release upload to the OSGeo server.

I am also a stopper for all of the OSGeo4W activities, and 1.8 will be
the last release of OSGeo4W binaries by the Hobu development team. We
are moving to being entirely Conda-based official Windows binaries
thanks to Brad Chambers' efforts. Conda feedstocks allow contributors
managed by GitHub credentials to control and manage the binary build
process. Conda also has a much wider installed base and IT/security shop
blessing than OSGeo4W.
