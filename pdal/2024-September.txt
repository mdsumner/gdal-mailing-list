All,

PDAL 2.8.0 is released https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/2.8.0

An important change to note is writers.las now defaults to writing LAS 1.4 content with PDRF 7.

New stages include filters.expressionstats and filters.label_duplicates.

Subject: [pdal] Trouble reading projection from some 3DEP tiles
Message-ID: <ec421794-6106-4ef3-b7e7-f290035b7796@gmail.com>

I've noticed that for some of the 3DEP tiles that PDAL doesn't calculate 
a 4326 BBOX.? This seems to be related to Proj not liking the how the 
projection is specified in the LAZ file.? If I force the projection as 
EPSG:6344+5703 in the reader then "pdal info" works as expected.? My 
main question is how can I tell if the issue is with the CRS in the LAZ 
file or the problem is with PDAL/Proj not being flexible enough in 
parsing the CRS?

Steps to reproduce:
 ??? wget 
https://rockyweb.usgs.gov/vdelivery/Datasets/Staged/Elevation/LPC/Projects/MN_UpperMissRiver_B22/MN_UpperMissRiver_2_B22/LAZ/USGS_LPC_MN_UpperMissRiver_B22_334_5271.laz

 ??? pdal info --all USGS_LPC_MN_UpperMissRiver_B22_334_5271.laz

Observations:
 ??? Under "stac" there is a error with message "Failed to create STAC 
Feature with missing key. 'EPSG:4326'".

 ??? Under stats.bbox there is no 4326 bbox calculated.

And with --verbose 8 I get:

Is this a different issue than the one you reported earlier in the day?

Jim,

pdal info reports the stored spatial reference. I think all the other
information can be found from projinfo. I would ask on the proj
mailing list if you can't figure it out.

This file has a technically invalid junky COMPD_CS defined that Even added some compensation to handle in GDAL and PROJ (note the "UTM zone 15N + NAVD88 height - US Geoid Model of 2018" bits in the name). Something about this name or its form must not match the pattern the compensation currently handles.

Yes, separate issues, so separate email threads.

I believe that PDAL is correctly reporting these files as invalid.

lasinfo reports more information on these, but PDAL is correctly
telling you what is wrong.

Hi all
I appreciate the approach of PDAL reporting what is wrong and saying 'nope,
not proper las' - currently I'm working on a small project where that is
important feedback to a vendor.

The issue I can see around this style of hard rejecting a dataset is that
forensic data examination is ...difficult.

For example 'PDAL: readers.las: Extra byte specification exceeds point
length beyond base format length.' leads to lots of reading and guesswork,
because I can't actually interrogate the data without knowing to use other
tools. The current workaround is LASpy -> PDAL. If it helps to know, LASpy
reads in then writes the same files out as LAS which passes PDAL checks. I
should get around to closing that loop today (ie reporting what is
different about the LASpy-written lasfile).

Yes everyone in the lidar loop should check that their data are properly
LAS compliant before publishing. It doesn't happen, that's how it is.

What are the issues around pdal -info saying 'nope, not proper las' and
spewing out at least the header and some point data anyway?

Thanks,

Adam

In most cases the error message indicates more than "nope, not proper
LAS".  Some could be more informative.

This message could provide some numbers, but it's also pretty clear
what the problem is, IMO.

We have discussed a PDAL command that would specifically validate LAS
files. Perhaps your client would be interested in funding this work?
