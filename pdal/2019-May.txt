Hello,

Is there a way to modify the resolution of coordinates stored in the
LAS/LAZ files. I find currently the file stores upto 2 decimal places. Is
there a way to increase or decrease it?

Wwarm Rgards,

Thejus,

You control these with the writers.las.scale_{x|y|z} options of writers.las https://pdal.io/stages/writers.las.html <https://pdal.io/stages/writers.las.html> Additionally, if you are working exclusively with LAS data, you might also issue the --writers.las.forward=all option to carry forward all metadata, including scale/offset from a single file transformation.

> pdal translate in.las out.las --writers.las.scale_x=0.001 --writers.las.scale_y=0.001 --writers.las.scale_z=0.001 --writers.las.offset_x=auto --writers.las.offset_y=auto --writers.las.offset_z=auto

> pdal translate in.las out.las --writers.las.forward=all

There are a couple of reasons why we do not default these options to always being set:

* What are we to do if the translation includes multiple files at once?
* Ambiguities that result from changing the LAS version
* What are we to do in situations where multiple LAS files are being written?

It is a surprise, but users have to be explicit about their LAS metadata settings with PDAL. Once they are, they should be able to achieve most everything they need.

Additionally, I wrote a tutorial of these issues on the website at https://pdal.io/tutorial/las.html <https://pdal.io/tutorial/las.html>

Hope this helps,

Howard

Hello Howard,

I apologize for the stupid question.

How is the scale value dependent on the resolution of the coordinates.
Isn't the data type for coordinates double?
I see in the help file "written value = (nominal value - offset) / scale".
so does this mean the written value is changed from double to integer when
it is being written to file?
Also, Is it limited to PDAL or LAS files in general.

Warm Regards,
Thejus

Yes.  This is how the LAS file format is designed. See the specification
for details:

http://www.asprs.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/LAS_1_4_r13.pdf

PDAL stores X/Y/Z as doubles internally.  The file representation depends
on the particular format.

All,

PDAL version 1.9.1 is not available for download:

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/1.9.1

This is a bug fix release.  If you are having no issues with PDAL 1.9, you
likely do not to install version 1.9.1, but look over the release notes to
confirm.

Thanks,

Hi Andrew,
are you planning to update also the version in Conda?
I just tried to update my PDAL environment in windows using Conda but there
are no updates available and my version is stille 1.8.

Thanks

Silvia,

It has been updated already. See https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pdal.

If you are having trouble updating, you can file a ticket at
https://github.com/conda-forge/pdal-feedstock/issues/new. Follow the
instructions, providing `conda info` and `conda list` outputs as well as
the command you were using to try to update.

Hi Bradley,
I just opened the link you sent to me, I didn't know that I should have
done a new install for he PDAL.
For the update I usually use the command:

conda update pdal

as explained in the quickstart (https://pdal.io/quickstart.html)

I will try to do the new install even if I am a bit scared with Conda since
I am absolutely new with it... and now I am working on a windows machine...

Hear you soon!

Silvia

Dear all,
I am trying to extract the ground points from a point cloud of a
terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) in a forestry environment, but the result
is not so good as the one I got using data from ALS.
What I did is:
1. denoise the dataset using the filter.outlier and a filter.range for Z
ranges:
            "type": "filters.outlier",
            "method": "statistical",
            "multiplier": 3,
            "mean_k": 8
2. apply a filter.elm and a filter.smrf to the cleaned dataset
For the SMRF filter I used these parameters:
            "type": "filters.smrf",
            "slope":0.2,
            "window":16,
            "threshold":0.45,
            "scalar":1.2

Unfortunately the resulting ground points contain also the first part of of
the trunks of the trees, how is it possible?

I am doing some testing changing the values of the SMRF parameters but the
results are almost the same.

Do some of you have experience with such kind of data? Am I missing some
operation for filtering? Could you please help me understanding at least
where to focus the attention to try to obtain something...

Thank you in advance.

Silvia

Hi Howard,
thanks for the useful information, I tried to follow your tutorial to
assign a CRS and some real world coordinates to my point cloud using these
parameters:
 "type":"writers.las",
            "a_srs": "EPSG:25832",
    "offset_x": "676686.38353",
    "offset_y": "5144012.94443",
            "filename":"output.las"

The program seems to work but if I then run an info, it seems that nothing
has changed.
Am I missing something?

Any suggestion is welcome! :-D

Silvia

You need to set scale_x, scale_y, and scale_z

Ok, I was just trying to do this...
just an additional question: do I have to specify also offset_z and scale_z
even if  I don't want to change z values?
So I will put
offset_z 0
scale_z 1

Thanks!

Silvia

So, I tried to set or not to set the z values but the problem
still persists.
In the info message of the las I can read:
offset x y z:               -676686.38352999999 -5144012.9444300001 0
min x y z:                  -80.5 -83.700000000000003 543.98000000000002
max x y z:                  82.799999999999997 84.850000000000009
591.76999999999998

So definitely the writer changed the offset to the right values but didn't
change the single coordinates... is this correct?
Any idea on what should I do to change all the coordinates?

Thanks again for your help!

Silvia

If you don't set Z, I believe it will use the defaults/automatically
determined values for Z.

Personally, if I like to set all 6 (x/y/z both offset and scale) if I set
any of them.  It probably doesn't make any difference, but it seems like
less room for surprises later.

If you don't want the defaults, you need need to specify values. See the
documentation for details about default values.

Yess,
thanks Andrew, I tried and specified the value of scale_z to 1 to preserve
my heights.

we had similar problems with TLS in urban context regarding first part pf
the cars
you can see our strategy to clean the first PMF effect in slides from
http://slides.com/darango/deck-10-11-12-11-12#/11
to
http://slides.com/darango/deck-10-11-12-11-12#/1
<http://slides.com/darango/deck-10-11-12-11-12#/11>5

the main idea is to do noise cleaning, PMF, filter on normal, filter on
kdistance, PMF again

not clear to me if you can have a good discrimination of the ground part of
the threes using normals due to nature of these surfaces.

cheers

Thank you Luigi!
I will follow you suggestions, "just" have to understand clearly the
commands you referres to in the slides.
Unfortunately I didn't know that there where also commands for normal and
so on, so what I did until now is more or less what there is in slide 12.
Regarding slide 13-14, didn't even know about the existence of the
command filters.normal and filters.kdistance. I will read them carefully
and then try to apply to my dataset.
I think that I will for sure sure ask for more help, but in any case I will
let you know how it works.

Many many thanks again!!!

Silvia

Subject: [pdal]  filtering duplicate points
Message-ID: <CAM1p0+GeppPNyB=4MhBORJDwGOmENqQTwD9moV2CShBaBezVYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I am hoping someone might be able to help me to use PDAL to filter for
duplicate points in a point cloud.

By duplicate, I mean points that are less than a threshold distance (e.g.
0.001 m) from other points in the cloud. I'm working with
photogrammetrically-generated point clouds, in some cases ca. 20-30% of the
points are 'duplicates' so removing these has some big benefits later in
the pipeline.

I'm looking for a filter that functions like 'Remove duplicate points
<https://www.cloudcompare.org/doc/wiki/index.php?title=Remove_duplicate_points>'
in CloudCompare. I wasn't able to see anything suitable under the filters >
cull documentation, unless filters.voxelcenternearestneighbor would achieve
this with cell set to 0.001?

If anyone else thinks that a filter.duplicate function might be helpful,
I'm happy to submit a feature request via Github.

Thanks
Andy

Andrew,

 

You can use filters.sample and just set a small radius.

Thanks for the suggestion Mike,

I just tried running
                        {
                            "type": "filters.sample",
                            "radius": 0.001
                        },
on a test cloud with n = 6650 points. With a 0.001 m threshold CloudCompare
removes 1782 as duplicates (ca. 27%), and makes no visible difference to
the displayed cloud, so the points removed appear genuine. However, with
the above parameters, this PDAL pipeline only removes 6 duplicates.

I wondered whether filters.sample perhaps only considers proximity in XY
space? (this isn't currently specified in the documentation
<https://pdal.io/stages/filters.sample.html>). Apologies if I have missed
something simple, I'm still learning PDAL, but I like it.

Thanks,
Andy

filters.sample works in 3D.  I'm not sure about the difference you're
seeing.  I don't know what cloud compare is doing.  You're welcome to
submit a bug report if you have some data that you think isn't being
handled properly.

Andrew,

A look at the cloud compare code suggests it works very differently from
PDAL filters.sample and depends on the way that points are distributed in
an octree.  Rather than checking actual distance, CC tries to remove points
in octree cells, that may be closer than the specified distance, depending
on the octree organization.  You might try setting the distance smaller in
PDAL to see if you get results more to your liking.  (This is based on a
very cursory look at the CC code, so take it with a grain of salt.)

Subject: [pdal] Streaming versus non-streaming LAS read perfromance
Message-ID: <3827c36ef86a90a8150693d26e014f88.squirrel@mail4india.com>




Greetings,
I have a huge performance issue with reading LAS
points on large files.
I initially implemented a non-streaming read
using PointViewSet as in the examples, and this worked fine. However
on larger LAS files e.g. a 1GB file with 150 million points, the memory
usage would go up to 15GB, and the load would take around 3-5
minutes.
Then, I switched to a streaming read
using FixedPointTable and StreamCallbackFilter. This uses much less
memory but is VERY slow. The 150 million points take 15+ minutes to
load..The issue seems to be that memory is being allocated in increments
of 3MB, and this takes forever. tried various values for the
FixedPointTable size, but this seems to have no effect.
I would
prefer to use the streaming approach to do fast low-res partial reads etc.
and to keep the memory usage down, if only I could improve the loading
time.
I am using PDAL 1.7.2. I was wondering if I am doing something
very wrong, or whether I should just update to 1.9
Any advice would
be hugely appreciated!
many thanks,
Karthik
Bala

Hi,

I don't know what your problem might be.  In the past I have done timing of
stream/standard mode and they've been comparable.  I don't think we've
changed anything recently that would impact LAS reading performance unless
there's more to your code than you've shown.  I don't know what memory
would be allocated in 3MB chunks.  Generally, PDAL doesn't allocate heap
memory during the read process.

A couple of thoughts:

1) Rather than call prepare() on the stage, you can call preview().  This
returns a structure that contains the point count.  I don't think this
should have any impact on performance.
2) In order to debug, I would eliminate your processing code, whatever that
might be, just to simplify.  There are suggestions in the non-streaming
code that you are threading things in a way that we simply can't see or
analyze.

If you can pin things down better, please let me know and I can take a look.

Subject: [pdal] OSGeo Community Sprint Recap for PDAL
Message-ID: <BE14A347-6049-4EEB-B807-4164D580065D@hobu.co>

All,

The OSGeo Community Sprint saw a fury of activity by new and experienced developers alike to PDAL. I would like to thank everyone for attending and contributing activity to the PDAL codebase, and I thought I would highlight that activity here.

James McClain (new contributor!) added TIN'ing features to filters.hag https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2520 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2520> to make it more accurate 

Kirk McKelvey (reactivated contributor!) worked to eliminate PDAL's PCL dependency by starting development of native PCD read/write support https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2526 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2526>

Jim Klassen worked a number of E57 issues related to normal information and omitted/hidden points. https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2530 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2530> https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2529 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2529> 

Andrew Bell worked on GDAL 3.0 / PROJ 6 SRS issues that have surfaced due to PDAL's usage of coordinate system handling in those tools. He also closed a number of bugs and and pull requests.

Vaclav Petras enhanced GRASS's PDAL ingestion routines to support stream ingestion and investigated supporting pipeline operations. 

Grigory Pomadachin investigated emitting Apache Arrow data structures via the Java bindings from PDAL for use in those environments.

Brad Chambers documented the new covariancefeatures filter, removed the deprecated filters.mongus filter, and enhanced eigen operations for PDAL filters that use them.

Peter Limkilde Svendsen worked on PDAL's delaunay filter.

Thank you again for these wonderful contributions to the PDAL codebase. We had fun in Minneapolis sprinting with you. Till next time!

Howard

Message-ID: <CAMwWki=SvVn25rW8Gq=tMmAzdMSgYq+O2+E2hXG3yDCqs0BLHw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I have recently installed pdal (1.9.1) using Conda to use 'readers.rxp'.
However, I encountered an error ("Couldn't create reader stage of type...
") when I tried to use it. I also found no driver installed for
'readers.rxp'. Do I miss anything? I'd appreciate any comment/suggestion.

Regards,
Hiro

Hiro,

The RXP driver is not installable via Conda. You will have to build it yourself with your own access to the RIEGL SDK.

Thank you Howard and Bradley. I guess I do not understand how you build
PDAL with RiVLiB library. Can I somehow see the link here (
https://pdal.io/compilation/unix.html#configure-your-optional-libraries)? I
cannot see the page because of an unknown error...

Thanks,
Hiro

Dear Luigi,
finally I could start to work again on the DTM extraction and I was trying
to apply the same commands as in your slides.
Unfortunately I am not so smart to understand how to do this kind of
assignment in a PDAL pipeline:

- normalZ [0:0.6] : Classification ->1
- normalZ ! [0:0.6] : Classification ->2
- merge soil / no soil

I tried using the filter.assign but it seems that I can not assign values
of a field while filtering on an other field.
And also I can not understand what you mean with merge soil/no soil...

The pipeline I did is like this:

{
    "pipeline": [
{
            "type": "readers.las",
            "filename":"aaa.las"
        },
{
            "type":"filters.range",
            "limits":"Classification[2:2]"
        },
{
            "type":"filters.normal",
            "knn": 30
    },
{
            "type":"filters.assign",
            "assignment" : "normalZ[0:6]=Classification[2]",
            "assignment" : "normalZ[0:6]!=Classification[1]"
    },
        {
            "type": "writers.las",
            "filename":"bbb.las"
        }
    ]
}

Could you please address me to the right commands to use to finalize the
pipeline?

Thank you for the big help!

Best regards

Silvia

Sorry Luigi...
I realized that the filter to use is the filter.ferry with a pipeline like
this:
 {
            "type":"filters.ferry",
            "dimensions":"NormalZ[0:6]=>Classification[2]"
    },
or at least, I guess because now I have the problem that the NormalZ field
do not exist. So my question is: should I write the file after
filter.normal to have this field or is it possible to use it in the same
pipeline? from the documentation it seems that it should be possible but I
can not find an example or something which could help...
If I have to write the file, should I specify also to insert the NormalZ
field or is it automatic?

Thank you in advance for the help!

Best regards

Silvia

writer LAS does not write automatically any field that is not specified by
LAS format => extra_dims option of writers.las have to be set... eg.
"extra_dims":"all"

Thank you Luigi,
so the only possibility to access to the values of NormalZ is by writing
them into the LAS?
The documentation says: "The filter produces four new dimensions (NormalX,
NormalY, NormalZ, and Curvature), which can be analyzed directly, or
consumed by downstream stages for more advanced filtering."

Is it possible to access these new variables via pipeline without writing
and reading them from LAS?

Thanks

Silvia

Yes, you can use the new dimensions in filters after the ferry filter. You just can’t persist them in the output file without the extra dims parameter as they are not standard las dimensions.

You are also not going to be able to do the conditional assignment and
ferry approaches you are attempting. Please read the documentation
carefully for each of these filters. Ferry can either create a new
dimension or copy one dimension to another. Assignment can assign a static
value to a range in a single dimension, but cannot mix dimensions (i.e.,
assign classification = 2 where normalZ = whatever). Luigi's pipelines have
solved this problem using either Python filters are through using the tag
and inputs options to create more complex pipelines.

Thank you all for the clarifications,
I guessed that mixing different variables with conditions was not possible
wth the ferry and assign filters, I definitely tried but no success... and
you confirmed me this.

So the best way to do this is finally to write the variables to a new LAS,
then work with an externa program on the assignments between one variable
and the other and then come back to PDAL with the modified LAS to do the
final operations?

Really thanks for the help!

Silvia

Dear Colleague,

Multiple Level-1B, Level-2, and Level-3A data sets from the Ice, Cloud, and
land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission are now available at the NASA
National Snow and Ice Data Center Distributed Active Archive Center (NSIDC
DAAC). These data sets provide backscatter profiles; geolocated photon
data; atmospheric layer characteristics; and geolocated surface elevations
for land ice, sea ice, vegetation and land, and inland water. The data are
available beginning 13 October 2018 and may have gaps in coverage due to
processing lag times. These temporal and spatial data gaps are expected to
be filled in the coming weeks. Additional Level-3A and Level-3B data sets
will be released as the data become available, including higher level
gridded data sets.

For information about the ICESat-2 mission and data sets please visit the
ICESat-2 mission web page at the NSIDC DAAC: https://nsidc.org/data/icesat-2
