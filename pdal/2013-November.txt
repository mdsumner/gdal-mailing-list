Subject: [pdal] Loading several LAS files

Hi,

I figured out what what happening and I will share it with you just in 
case somebody has the same issue. I realized that the format that I 
added in pointcloud_formats was not matching the format of the LAS files 
(the format I added in the table was only X,Y,Z and the LAS format has 
many more attributes). The issue if that if this happens the format I 
add is ignored and a new format which is the one in the LAS file is used 
which is fine but there is not any error or warning message so I had no 
clue that was happening. In the end I realized of that (I thought the 
LAS file only contained XYZ) and I just added a filter in the XML to 
only use XYZ. Now, the correct format is being used and my parameters 
are not ignored.

Regards,

O.

Hi PDAL and GDAL list

I'm referring to the error reported above when (still) trying to compile
PDAL with pointcloud support.

What I'm really wondering is why GDAL developpers are calling function
gtCPLRealloc
the same as in GeoTIFF lib but with different declaration?

See
/usr/include/gdal/cpl_port.h:533:89: => ?void* gtCPLRealloc(void*, size_t)?
and
/usr/include/geotiff/cpl_serv.h:144:20 => ?void* gtCPLRealloc(void*, int)?

-S.

Merci beaucoups, Even.
I'll try to forward this hint to PDAL devs.

I'll make the change of #define'ing CPL_SERV_H_INCLUDED in PDAL.

I will also note that there is now a Vagrant configuration for PDAL in the master branch that you can use to stand up an Ubuntu instance and play around with things like pgpointcloud, etc. See http://www.pointcloud.org/vagrant.html for more information and https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/tree/master/scripts/vagrant for the configuration scripts used to build it all out.

OpenLayers is a web JavaScript technology. PDAL is a data translation software focused on transformations from one format to another. You could try using PDAL to export point cloud data to GeoJSON (using drivers.text.writer) and importing that into an OpenLayers map in some way. You are very likely to overwhelm any browser, however, with any significant amount of point cloud data.

Eran-

The sheer volume of point cloud data, as Howard says, makes it very hard to display in a traditional web browser system, e.g. OpenLayers fed by JSON. You'll need to find a way to reduce the point count in a smart way - like feeding out a LOD (level of detail) algorithm.

Two or three years ago, people started looking for good ways to do this. There might be an open source solution by now, but it would require something more heavyweight than just OpenLayers.

Does it need to run in a browser?  If not, I've been working on a
desktop-based lidar point cloud viewer which might help you out - see
http://c42f.github.io/displaz.  I'm close to a 0.2 release which will
include a binary installer for windows.

Cheers,

Hi:

 

1. I am building PDAL under Fedora 19. I want to support NITF. Should only the NITRO NITF library from github ( /hobu/nitro ) be the one built to use with PDAL, or will it also work with the NITRO NITF repository from SourceForge.  I see you use NITRO NITF version 2.7, but diff'ing them show some source code changes.

 

2. Using the /hobu/nitro repository, the build instructions indicate to use WAF as is typical of NITRO NITF. When I ran WAF it threw an error ("build module not found"). However I saw cmake files and ran it and it built with no problem. Is CMAKE good to go to build the lib? It only produced dynamic linked libraries (libnitf-c.so and libnitf-cpp.so). I tested it and it was working.

 

Thanks

The SourceForge version had a number of deficiencies, with the biggest being that it didn't support dynamic linking properly on Windows (a requirement of maintaining LGPL compliance).

I couldn't get WAF to work on *nix, let alone Windows, so I finally gave up, dropped it into github, and rolled a CMake-based build system that properly exported the symbols necessary to use Nitro on Windows dynamically linked. I left most of the repository alone, however, to ease merges back from the master tree. I hope some day the authors are interested in my contributions, but what exists now at http://github.com/hobu/nitro is sufficient for the LAS-in-NITF requirements I have.

Yes the CMake-based build system is good to go, and is very likely going to be the easiest to use. It doesn't have J2K detection and other things auxiliary library support yet, because I only needed to write LAS-in-NITF files to meet my obligations. LAS-in-NITF is the horrid turducken you imagine it to be, and PDAL's metadata support is limited to IDATETIM and a few other items. You'll have to read the source code of drivers.nitf.writer for more information. Sorry there isn't more yet.

drivers.nitf.reader is implemented using GDAL's NITF support. This is a little bit different than Nitro, and I'd like to someday rework the reader to use Nitro as well, both for a simple story and implicit compatibility. 

Hope this helps,

Howard

Howard:

I appreciate your response. I confirms what I had thought.

I have been involved having to meet the requirement of wrapping LIDAR in
NITF for library ingest for over 5 years. I like your turducken analogy.
I have been  trying to been trying to move away from it all together.
Mechanisms exist for the files to be ingested into national libraries in
the native LAS format and we have developed an NGA XML based metadata
specification that is embedded in VLRs. This allows us to provide the
additional  required metadata in the LAS files, and not loose it when
the LIDAR data is un-wrapped. I was encouraged to see the NITF support
in PDAL which can provide the un wrapping without having to unwrap with
the specialized NITF2LAS software. With the increasing use of PDAL there
is more leverage to move to native LAS storage and provides the pathway
to support any future new LIDAR storage formats.

I use the NITRO NITF library (along with LibLAS) to develop software for
QC and data import of our NITF wrapped LIDAR prior to ingest. I had run
into similar difficulties in building. On Windows  and Linux versions I
statically linked in. It was always presenting challenges. I would like
to see your changes go in the NITRO repository. I have also had to make
some change to meet my requirements and there was not much activity by
the authors with the exception of the fairly recent 2.7 release. I would
have thought they would have liked to attract more help with project.

I saw the NITF reader support was provided by GDAL and that there was a
start on the writer. I had considered creating a writer as we had some
of the sources asking about a non-proprietary wrapping tool.

Thanks,

Todd
