scikit-build is pip-installable and pure Python.

Because distutils/setuptools isn't a generic builder environment. scikit-build is just a CMake wrapper, which we've already used to implement build settings for the PDAL Python stages and tests. I had implemented about half of the things I needed to achieve it manually in distutils in the PR https://github.com/PDAL/python/pull/47 <https://github.com/PDAL/python/pull/47> but it was quickly getting out of hand. It wasn't working cross-platform, and it didn't support all of the Python items either because there isn't a generic distutils compiler for "make a shared module". That's only for Python modules. I was basically building scikit-build, and I realized this after some research and pivoted to using it instead.

Once I switched to scikit-build, I was able to reuse much of the build configuration we already had, I was able to build and run the tests on all three platforms [1], and all of the configurability of the previous inside-PDAL deployment of the stages was preserved.

For those wonder why we bothered splitting things apart, the full loop of PDAL -> Numpy -> PDAL -> Numpy now works (see the Reading using Numpy Arrays example on https://pypi.org/project/PDAL/ <https://pypi.org/project/PDAL/> ). This was very difficult to get working with PDAL was holding thing Python version and configuration fixed to how it was originally compiled.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL:  cannot allocate memory for output buffer
Message-ID: <002f01d60bc2$89e02f20$9da08d60$@lim@gpslands.com>

Hi,

 

Just recently, I'm encountered a new error from PDAL ver. 2.0.1 while
writing to PostGres database ver. 9.6 or 10.11, using a pipeline:

PDAL:  cannot allocate memory for output buffer

 

The error occurred after about 1.5 mins writing to the memory (about 9GB of
Ram used).

The source laz file is only about 610MB, and the PC has about 62GB free RAM.


 

This error did not show until recently, and I suspect it could be caused by
a recent Windows Update.

 

Please advise.

 

Thank you.

 

Best Regards,

 

Peter Lim

Hi,I am starting to investigate PDAL, being a user of LasTools/TerraScan to process velodyne puck data to see if the noise filters can improve the overall data output.
One of the important filtering steps I find in helping with cloud quality is to filter the data by range from the scanner using either lastrack / classify by range.
Is there a similar filter in PDAL? The filters.range doesn't seem to quite fit the requirement, although i might be misunderstanding.
Many thanks for the advice and apologies if this has been asked before.
Kind regards,nick

I am new to this.
I have a project where I need to use PDAL.
However, PDAL website states that the only way to install PDAL in Windows
is through Conda. I have Python 3.8.2 installed without using Anaconda. I
can't install conda using pip install and I don't want to use Anaconda as
it doesn't come with Python 3.8 and upgrading to that version using conda
has issues.
I cannot install PDAL using pip install either.
I am using Windows 10 and am wondering if there are other ways to resolve
the install?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Hi Samantha

…it seems odd that there would be issues with py3.8.2 and conda. It’s there
as a package: https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python

Using virtual environments is really key to managing python on machines you
want to do more than one thing with (for example your laptop/desktop
machine).

If you’re in a conda virtual environment, try really hard to avoid using
pip.

There’s a few extra words about PDAL installation with conda here:
https://pdal.io/workshop/conda.html#
<https://pdal.io/workshop/conda.html#what-is-conda>

Hope that helps,

Adam

Yes, it is there. One can use it, it processes but Python is not updated.
If you check the github or overstack on conda and Python 3.8.2, there are
others with issues as well.
If PDAL can only be installed with conda, and there's no alternative, then
I will uninstall Python3.8 and try conda all over again.
It's just that I'm in a time crunch for my project and I'm really trying to
get these installs issues over with.
Thanks for hearing me out.

Samantha, 

 

Conda is just one method. But you can install pdal under python 3.8 on conda

 

conda create –name pdal3.8

conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda install python=3.8 pdal -y

 

Each conda environment is separate so you can have python3.7 or 3.8 or whatever environment.

A few additional points:

* If you don't need Anaconda, use the Miniconda installer.
* ArcGIS has a Conda environment that can be used
* Adam's advice is spot-on. Create new environments for different activities or projects and don't use pip unless you have to.

> If PDAL can only be installed with conda, and there's no alternative, then I will uninstall Python3.8 and try conda all over again.

There are plenty of alternatives, it's just that they're all likely to be much harder than installing and using PDAL via Conda, especially on Windows.

Hi Samantha,

If you are looking for a solution where you just extract a zipfile on 
Windows and run: try MS4W, which includes PDAL (and includes Python 
3.7.5).  The steps are:
  - download zip from https://ms4w.com
  - extract to root of drive (C:/)
  - open CMD window
  - cd c:/ms4w
  - setenv.bat
  - python --version
  - pdal --drivers

Thank you, Mike, Howard and Adam for all your help.
I will explain more the complexity that went on with all the softwares
involved: Anaconda comes with 2, one with Python 2.7, and one with Python
3.7. I used to use Anaconda with Python2, and then with the addition of
Python3, I tried to create virtual env for both with the Anaconda.
Researched and tried various methods, but none works with the Anaconda
setup. But ArcGIS still uses python2.7 so I uninstall Anaconda with
Python2. REinstall ArcGIS which imports Python2 in the backdrop. I
reinstall Anaconda with 3.7. To upgrade to Python3.8 via conda, need to
upgrade conda, then use it to import 3.8. Processed but nothing happen.
REad others with similar issues. Uninstall Anaconda and install Python3.8
on its own. Everything works fine. Now I'm using GRASS GIS for project. Can
use ArcGIS but GRASS is efficient for Lidar processing but its libLAS that
it bases on doesn't support minor version higher than 1.2 and the LAS file
I import for project has minor version greater than that. Read two tools
that can help: LAStools and PDAL. Know one PDAL module can be run in GRASS,
but PDAL cannot be imported using pip, just conda.

I look at Adam's Anaconda link, if you look at the files section, you
cannot find a windows python3.8 edition. I understand Mike's way of
importing PDAL over Python3, but Python doesn't come with conda installed
and I am back to square one. Here's what I will do rather than poke around
as this is getting way too long: I will uninstall python3.8 and reinstall
Anaconda. Once the project is over, I can research and reconfigure.

I completely understand why PDAL has to install over conda base off Adam's
email. This conversation provides great insight and I thank you for your
time.

Have a great day!

I want to roll back what I said in my latest email because Howard pointed
out something I read but it didn't sink in.
There is a conda installed in ArcGIS. I don't have to uninstall and
reinstall a couple softwares.
I have a question though, since both Howard and Adam recommend using a
virtual environment. Since the conda is under ArcGIS, the myenv will be
created under the ArcGIS umbrella, no? I read PDAL write up on this
https://pdal.io/quickstart.html#install-conda

Is this the way to go?
Thanks, there is a silver lining in this afterall.

Hi Samantha

It reads a lot like you’re trying to drive PDAL via a point-and-click
interface (GRASS/ArcGIS/??)?

it might be worth stepping back and re-thinking your workflow to include
some command line / python coding operations where things involve PDAL
(this is my approach)

A bunch of folks (myself included) also offer consulting services to deal
exactly with helping people through time-critical point cloud problems. My
side is workflow development / data interrogation / interpretation; others
specialise in programming and actually building integrations like desktop
GIS support.

While the software is free, these parts require funding.

Regards,

Adam

I wanna build PDAL ON windows C++ MFC programming.
 
i just need to view .bpf file and translate to las on C++(visual studio)
 
I tried to follow the contents of the PDAL homepage, but it wasn't easy. and also tried to this page following.  https://www.gadom.ski/2017/04/21/pdal-on-windows.html
 
this is using for CMake build but, The following error occurs :
 
 
 
 
and I also tried to try using json, It is frequently wander in the environments settings of using json to drive PDAL at C++.
 
so  I'd appreciate it if you could give me a  detailed instructions or sequence.
 
I'm a beginner, so there's a lot of stuck(?). 
 
Thank you for your help in advance. :)

You should be able to simply grab the PDAL binaries from Conda Forge using VSCode (see https://pdal.io/download.html#conda <https://pdal.io/download.html#conda>), install them into an environment, and issue

> pdal translate in.bpf out.las

You're seeing a cmake warning, not an error. It can be safely ignored.
