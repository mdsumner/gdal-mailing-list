I cannot compile boost by myself, I have to host pdal in a server
where I have no root permission and they doesn't wont/are not able to
recompile all the libraries related to pdal. (It was already difficult
ask them to compile pdal :-( )

Message-ID: <9A8E9C0EA026884EABE05D98404513950663B5E8@NBSVR-MAIL01.radiantblue.local>

Hi,

This is related to Michael's issue post here: https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/569. I need access to min/max bounds on quantities like intensity values, geographic bounds, etc (specifically in las files but should be generalized). I know those values are available in the las header. Yet it seems that to obtain these "stats", I need to employ a stats filter and read all the points. Is there another mechanism for quickly reading certain general properties (like bounds) that may be available from the header?

Thanks,
Oscar

Would that it were so.

You *could* crawl the metadata object to find the las header, BUT it?s a bad idea: the values in the header can?t be relied on, as the generating apps often get it wrong. LAS is notorious on this one. Trust me. :-)     (trivial example: sometimes the min/max corresponds to the data *before* they did some cleaning to remove noise points??..)

Furthermore, because PDAL is a general / format-independent library, it tends to only expose as 1st class citizens the info that it ?knows? is always true and will always be there for all formats.

I've written the infrastructure to provide what you're asking, but I don't
think I ever hooked it up to a command-line app.  I'll do this shortly.
But in the end, it doesn't matter if you can't trust the data in the
header, as Michael suggests is often the case.  This really is too bad --
not much point in having the data if it's not correct.

We were talking about providing JSON output.  Would this work for you?

Hi Andrew,

JSON would work.

Re the untrustworthy data: that's a bummer. But perhaps certain dimensions are more trustworthy than others, and the user will know which ones are good for specific datasets. In those cases, getting to the header data is still a worthwhile effort.

Oscar

On las data I had, the scanned min, max values were exactly the same as

I would say that most of the LAS files I've seen have good bounds, but it is not uncommon to find a mismatched one. The histogram seems to be more frequently mismatched than the bounds. Once upon a time, you would also find mismatched record counts, but with LAS 1.4, those kinds of files are now unrecoverable.

libLAS (and older versions of PDAL) have had a "give me the headers whatever they are, but don't trudge through all the data" method, and the "QuickInfo" stuff that Andrew is describing which is now available in master speaks to the capability.

Thinking this over on the way in this morning, I think I actually have a valid use case in my own work for ?approximate? metadata. I wouldn?t do any serious computation based on them, but I could use them for display purposes and ?estimating? the sizes of things.

Specifically, it would be nice if in there was a way to say getApproxNumPoints() and getApproxBBox(). These values would be set by the individual readers at initialization time, before reading any points, if the reader thinks it might have something useful to contribute. The user would explicitly choose to read these values or not, and if he does so, he does so with the understanding that they may not be correct.

For the unupdated-las-header problem I mentioned earlier, this would be just fine.

Hmmm?.

Message-ID: <E9E9AF562B0C32439CFBE298B31F95A4266BEB@USFWA1E14-02.corp.exelisinc.com>

I seem to be having some trouble getting PDAL to recognize a new writer that I am creating as a plugin. I found that if I changed StageFactory::loadPlugins so that the "pluginDir" was equal to ".:./bin" so that it would search in the same directory as the pdal.exe executable, then it would work. I suppose that what I should have done was to set an environment variable named "PDAL_DRIVER_PATH" to ".:./bin" instead. Is that correct? If so, any thoughts on the best way to distribute the pdal.exe file to another user working on Windows? Is it expected that the other user would need to set that environment variable, as well as install all the supporting PDAL libraries (boost, all the OSGeo4W64 libraries, etc.)?

You've located a section of code that attempts to set some default search
locations. Looks like this needs to be augmented for Windows users. These
default paths are especially convenient for developers who don't want to
re-install the latest plugins every time they recompile. They can instead
find the libraries in the build directory.

Yes, especially when deploying PDAL, you would want to set
PDAL_DRIVER_PATH. The actual path may vary from one system to another.

This work has now landed in master and is ready to test out. In short, add scale_x, scale_y, or scale_z (along with any corresponding offset_{x|y|z} options you might want) and it will store scaled int32_t's rather than doubles now for all three db drivers (pgpointcloud, oracle, sqlite).

I saw the same issue. What I ended up doing was to add a ?#ifdef PDAL_HAVE_LAZPERF? statement on line 128 and a #endif on line 204. This seems to match the #ifdef at the top of the file around the #include?s for laz. Just my two cents.
