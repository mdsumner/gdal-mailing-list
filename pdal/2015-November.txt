Another GDAL sensitivity we're seeing here is GDAL's default cache settings are not very aggressive. Given the stripped TIFF file, setting the cache size to 500 allows the file to colorize nearly as fast as the tiled:

I have updated the docs with information about this scenario http://www.pdal.io/stages/filters.colorization.html#considerations

There's maybe some more performance to get out of the colorization filter in how we are calling GDAL. I will investigate this a little bit more, but this setting should get you much closer to LAStools.

All,

It is a common desire to be able to clip data with OGR-readable vector data. I have written a tutorial that demonstrates the pipeline and approach you can use to do this with PDAL.

Hi devs,

we update to the last PDAL version using RPM tool mock [0], but now my
pipeline is not working anymore, the problem is this

ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
PDAL: ImportError('numpy.core.multiarray failed to import',)

Is this error related to our installation or it could be a bug?

If you could attach your broken pipeline to the ticket, that would be
helpful.

Subject: [pdal] PDAL Tutorials
Message-ID: <CAJyqqPzQga0NcV4Ogf1RY-waj+8ZsPrCL1RZV5+3rwXvm2EuvA@mail.gmail.com>

Since the release of PDAL v1.0.0 [1], we've been making strides in bringing
our documentation up-to-date (we've still got a ways to go!). Of course,
we've also been busy adding some new bells and whistles, and making other
improvements for those who may be building off of master [2].

For those who may be interested, I wanted to take a minute to highlight
just a few of these updates and enhancements.

The first one is not even a tutorial. Did you know that PDAL command-line
application can now construct pipelines on-the-fly with the translate
command? You can specify the input and output filename, along with a list
of any of PDAL's supported filters to be applied sequentially. Once you are
happy with your pipeline, you can output the pipeline XML for later reuse.
Find complete details at [3].

A common question is whether or not PDAL can compute normalized heights. In
[4], hobu provided a means of computing these height above ground values
given an input raster and some python scripting. Since then, I've added an
additional tutorial for performing the calculation directly on a point
cloud with point classifications. You can find it here [5].

Finally, I was recently looking for a means of subsampling my input point
cloud to accelerate another, downstream filtering process. PDAL has
provided a decimation and voxel grid filter for quite some time, but each
of these has drawbacks. I decided to implement a Poisson sampling technique
called dart throwing instead. This filter has now been added to master, and
a write up with a short comparison of the decimation approaches is provided
at [6].

I hope you enjoy. And feel free to let us know if you have any questions!

The answer is there isn't one yet, unfortunately. But now that you're asking, what should a readers.text do for PDAL? Just follow txt2las? Be something else? One of the reasons there isn't a text reader yet is I've been non-committal due to there being potentially so many mini-formats.

For my use case yes, it should just follow txt2las (i have txt file
and I want to convert in LAS), but maybe someone else have more idea
about it.
For the many mini-formats could be possible to have a parse/header
info like txt2las.

That's kind of the reason there isn't anything yet. There's like 10 (exaggerating) different plain text pathways in GDAL/OGR. It would be challenging to support tons of options in PDAL.

A simple txt2las-style reader should be possible though.

Message-ID: <15EF59DD-AC65-47A5-9AFA-377B1881CF9D@hobu.co>

All,

The PDAL development team is pleased to announce the release of PDAL 1.1.0. This release brings a number of new features including:

* readers.tindex -- create a GDAL-style tileindex with `pdal tindex` and then use it to merge and read data
* filters.dartthrowing -- see http://www.pdal.io/tutorial/dart-throwing.html for more 
* filters.height -- see http://www.pdal.io/tutorial/calculating-normalized-heights.html for more
* readers.ilvis2 -- see http://www.pdal.io/stages/readers.ilvis2.html for more information
* filters.hexbin -- https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/1042 now includes a simplified geometry from GEOS using TopologyPreservingSimplifier
* set the PDAL_DEBUG=on environment variable to see PDAL register/load its plugins

A number of bugs were fixed in this release including:

* https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1010 -- Python numpy import failing
* https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1040 https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/1022 and https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1049 -- PDAL SRS handling fixes
* https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/1032 - BPF auto-offset
* https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/1051 - readers.pgpointcloud oid selection

BEHAVIOR CHANGE

Some stages used a hackneyed Options/Option tree thing to define multiple options. This has been removed and flattened. Each stage now only has a single list of Option elements. We have tried to go through and clean up all uses and examples of this in the documentation and tests, but we've probably missed some.

+1 for a text file reader. As much as I hate them, dealing with text 
files is one of the main things that keeps me from using PDAL as much as 
I would like.

For the interface it seems like just mirroring the writers.text Options 
would be a good start. On top of that being able to skip a certain 
number of header lines and set a spatialreference would also be great.

Thanks,

Subject: [pdal] compile pdal with Python support
Message-ID: <CAK4m-3y8q-RiSLpD98R7SREnqEDMN1a06fWjBJT6nCKui-Hqyg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

we are trying to compile pdal with Python support but we are not able,
we active Python with PDAL_HAVE_PYTHON=ON but at the end of
compilation we have no python directory.
We also try to run "python setup.py build" into python directory but
we got an error "no module packaging.version"

Can someone help us?
We could use pip, but if it is not so complicate we would like to
compile it from the source code.

Thanks

Luca,

Presumably this issue is caused by not having python-devel and numpy-devel packages installed. The cmake numpy detection is not so verbose.

You must use pip or easy_install to install the packaging package:

$ pip install packaging

as a prerequisite before the PDAL Python extension can build/install.

Then the following command should work:

$ python setup.py build; python setup.py install

We cannot find RPM or Debian packages for numpy-devel, there is only numpy

we tried but we got this error

python setup.py build

There is something strange because we are running Python 2.7.5 but it
seems to check Python >= 3

Ok, this must install as part of numpy then.

you may need to install cython too

$ pip install cython

One gotcha I can think of is building PDAL against Python 2.x and then building the Python extension using Python 3.x. That scenario definitely will not work.

I wonder if the error you are seeing is due to Cython being missing though. Please try that first.
