All,

As part of our migration from homespun infrastructure to ReadTheDocs for management of our documentation, we have initiated a DNS change. We don't expect an outage during the transition, but it is possible. 

The final migration should have us providing multi-version docs via RTD, but that might take a few weeks...

Subject: [pdal] Change vertical datum
Message-ID: <CAP=Ak6j8NSpRVcumVZPFkp51Cazq9cwph-q2V5qYbGVppC_d1A@mail.gmail.com>

 Hello everyone:

I'm not sure that the topics that I expose correspond to the topics that
are covered in this list, if not, I wish you could tell me where to go.  Maybe
on the PROJ list?

When I do a vertical datum shift of a point cloud, using the following
pipeline:

[
"input.las",
{
"type":"filters.reprojection",
"in_srs":"EPSG:32614",
"out_srs":"+init=epsg:32614 +geoidgrids=C:/nubes/geoides/GGM10_GEO.gtx"
},
{
"type":"writers.las",
"filename":"output_with_Vertical_Datum_GGM2010.las"
}
]

Questions:

1.- After running the command I get an alert:

" Warning 1: +init=epsg:XXXX syntax is deprecated. It might return a CRS
with a non-EPSG compliant axis order. "

Could you tell me what I'm doing wrong at this point?

2.- What argument would I have to use to see in the metadata something like
"Vertical Datum": "GGM10" or "Mexican Gravimetric Geoid 2010"? Of course,
in case the datum change has been made.

Best regards

Subject: [pdal] USGS 3DEP point classification
Message-ID: <25FC6EB8-4316-4AAE-A898-2D63B6281B1A@yank.to>

I?m trying to get a sense of how point classifications get assigned with USGS 3DEP LAZ files.

I?m seeing the following looking at tiles for around Denver, Colorado:

1 (unclassified): usually maps to foliage/structures but also water.
2 (ground): usually maps to bare earth, roads, etc.
9 (water): maps to water.
7 (low point) and 11 (road surface) generally map to spurious atmospheric returns
17 (bridge deck) generally maps to surface features and 18 (high noise) to bare earth, but only within limited scan lanes. These two puzzle me.

Anyone know how these classifications are supposed to map out?

They should map according to the ASPRS LAS specification, and additionally, the USGS LiDAR Base Specification

Ulises,

PDAL supports whatever version of PROJ you have linked.

See https://pdal.io/tutorial/grid-shift.html for some inspiration on how facts might apply to your specific geodetic configuration. 

Additionally, you might find https://pdal.io/stages/filters.projpipeline.html useful for specific application of PROJ transformation steps to data.

To add to Howard's answer:

1) The warning is just a warning.? It is warning that if you have a CRS 
like EPSG:4326 that the proj4 string version won't know that it is 
really supposed to have coordinates in (lat, lon) order and will 
"incorrectly" treat it as (lon, lat) as proj4 does.? This generally 
isn't an issue for UTM projections which are, as far as I know, all in 
the (Easting, Northing) order which is the same as what proj4 assumes.

2) If you are using proj4 strings for the output projection (with 
vdatum) you will need to set the "a_srs" option in the writers.las stage 
to get the vertical datum written to the LAS file.

3) For both 1 and 2, it is "better" to specify the CRS as EPSG codes or 
as a fallback as WKT2.? For example, I use EPSG:6344+5703 for 
NAD83(2011)/UTM 15N/NAVD88 (North American Vertical Datum 1988 meters).? 
Hopefully, there is an EPSG code for GGM10 as the WKT2 method is very 
verbose.

4) I've noticed that using the proj4 strings can be significantly faster 
than using the proper EPSG codes for transforming points.? I looked into 
trying to figure out why this is the case a little, but ran out of time 
on to complete that investigation.? I suspect it has to do with proj 
looking up the best transformation for each point (which in the case of 
5703 includes searching multiple grid files, where specifying it as a 
proj4 string forces one grid file).

5) projinfo and gdalsrsinfo are your friends when searching for 
alternate representations (proj4, WKT, ...) of CRSs.

6) I'm not sure if this applies in your area, but make sure your 
vertical datum is defined for the horizontal datum you are using. For 
example, NAVD88 is not technically defined on WGS84, only on NAD83.? 
Also, the grid file used to do the vertical transformation has to match 
with the corresponding horizontal datum realization or errors will 
typically be introduced.? (NAVD88 2012 and 2018 grids go with 
NAD83(2011), the NAVD88 2009 grid goes with NAD83(NSRS2007), etc.)

All,

I am writing to inquire about pgpointcloud support in PDAL. I was cleaning up the repository of some very old XML stuff from the very early days of PDAL, and it is connected a little bit to pgpointcloud, and it had me wondering if that is seeing significant use at this point.

We should move it to Unsupported Plugins if we think that would better reflect its status in regards to maintenance and use. There hasn't been a commit of significance in two years, and none of the active PDAL maintainers are users of it. It isn't being tested by the continuous integration, and it is probable that it will rot with continued inattention.

Please chime in if you are using these drivers and report back their status to help us make a decision.

Hi Howard,

I'm using pgpointcloud driver ("writers.pgpointcloud") in PDAL pipeline to
export pt. cloud data into Postgres DB for my work usage.  I greatly
appreciate that PDAL can continue to maintain and support this plugin.

Thank you very much for doing a good job in providing this plugin.

Thank you very much.

Subject: [pdal] Bad allocation error
Message-ID: <0a3412b528ff43e49256038778665cb7@zi-mannheim.de>

Hello everyone,

I would like to assign a value from polygons (stored in a column "class") to a Classification attribute in a point cloud. Both, point cloud and geopackage are split into tiles, which means that the point clouds usually contain ~15 million points and geopackages contain ~35,000 polygons or less. I tried to process multiple point clouds and one of them worked, while the other ones always throw an error "PDAL: bad allocation". All the files have approximately the same size and I also tested it with a lot smaller area and smaller gpkg and it still did not work. The only thing that worked was splitting geopackages to very small files. The LAZ file that was successfully processed used around 15 GB of RAM, while the other files went up to 256 GB and it still wasn't sufficient. Do you have a suggestion what could be the reason for such an enormous use of memory?
Here is an example of a pipeline:

[
      {
            "type":"readers.las",
            "use_eb_vlr":"true",
            "filename":"D:/User/Nina/460000_5477000.laz"
      },
    {
        "type":"filters.overlay",
        "dimension":"Classification",
        "datasource":" D:/User/Nina/460000_5477000.gpkg",
            "column": "class",
            "where": "Classification == 8"
    },
      {
        "type":"writers.las",
            "compression": "true",
            "a_srs": "EPSG:25832",
            "extra_dims":"all",
        "filename":" D:/User/Nina/460000_5477000.laz"
    }
]

Thank you and best regards,
Nina

All?

Is there a way to download USGS 3DEP LIDAR data from for a rectangular AOI through PDAL, only providing the coordinates?

I?ve been looking at readers.ept, and it appears that you first need to identify LIDAR collect(s) that pertain to your AOI. Is there a master URL that rolls up the various collects or some automated way to get the collects for an AOI?

Thanks,

Andreas,
I could have this wrong, but I think the json file that has the boundaries
for the EPT datasets can be found at
https://github.com/hobuinc/usgs-lidar/blob/master/boundaries/boundaries.topojson.
That would allow you to figure out which datasets are within an AOI.
Standing up a service that would let you specify an AOI and then spit back
all the points, merging the different collects as it goes, has some
inherent problems. It's technically feasible; the issue is that some things
shouldn't be mixed. For example, pre and post-event collections for
hurricanes.

This is perfect. It will be a straightforward task to write a Python script that uses GDAL to perform the overlap calculations to determine the relevant collects.

Point taken on being careful with the merges. I?m using the LPC data to get a rough idea of average building/tree heights for radio propagation calculations, converting the LPC data to surface-height raster files with resolutions between 3m to 30m.

To date I?ve been converting LPC tiles to a raster tiles in parallel, then merging the raster tiles with GDAL as a sequential operation. I?m often processing several hundred square km of data at once, and telling PDAL to load all that data into memory at once doesn?t work out. Maybe there?s a trick I?m missing?

Thanks,

Andreas

I?m often processing several hundred square km of data at once, and telling PDAL to load all that data into memory at once doesn?t work out. Maybe there?s a trick I?m missing?

Dividing data processing is not PDAL's responsibility. We don't know your data, how dense it is, how much compute you have, how much storage you have, or how your network interconnects work. This is the long way of saying, you should control this yourself by using bounds/resolution on your readers.ept or readers.copc stage, queue various processes on whatever multiprocessing engine you wish, and reduce the data back together when you are done in whatever way makes sense for you.

Both, point cloud and geopackage are split into tiles, which means that the point clouds usually contain ~15 million points and geopackages contain ~35,000 polygons or less. I tried to process multiple point clouds and one of them worked, while the other ones always throw an error ?PDAL: bad allocation?. All the files have approximately the same size and I also tested it with a lot smaller area and smaller gpkg and it still did not work. The only thing that worked was splitting geopackages to very small files. The LAZ file that was successfully processed used around 15 GB of RAM, while the other files went up to 256 GB and it still wasn?t sufficient. Do you have a suggestion what could be the reason for such an enormous use of memory?

Nina,

I don't know the specifics of your scenario, but I should think you will want to break your processing up into something more specific. Make a loop that iterates each geometry in the geopackage and runs a pipeline for each that produces your classified las file and then merge them altogether at the end.

1) Convert your data to COPC.io format using writers.copc. 
2) Read each geometry in the geopackage and get its bounds
3) Write a pipeline (or use the Python bindings) to set the 'bounds' object of readers.copc to it
4) Permute the writers.las.filename to correspond to your feature id
5) Merge all of the files together once complete.

This model means that you should only read the points that matter for each polygon you are selecting. It should also parallelize conveniently using whatever batching approach you desire (I see you are on windows so that might be some powershell magic, IDK). 

It would just be speculation to explain why things are going haywire without your data and a test scenario.
