I thought it was my job to send filters.litree a file that already had a
suitable subsampling, something like just a point inside a sphere with
radius 2 cm. I have to read the paper or the litree code to understand, if
I can understand, what's going on there.

Subject: [pdal] About litree filter: too much computation time,
 and other questions.
Message-ID: <CAP=Ak6h9usCF86ZuC9zKs-d3qxyBG35AC9U0hkX=5D=MNQEheQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone:
I have a few questions about the "litree" filter and the computation time.

After reading the paper: "2021-Li-PERS.pdf" which talks about the "litree"
filter to segment trees, I thought I understood the mechanics of the
"litree" filter, but most likely not.

When applying filters.litree to a file
"L3_0+L3_1_sample_cada_4cm_suelo_dalaunay.las" with 2 million points, the
processing time I have so far is a little over 72 hours.

My pipeline is the following:
{
"pipeline":
[
        {
        "type":"readers.las"
        },
    {
        "type":"filters.litree",
        "min_points":3000,
        "min_height":3.0,
        "radius":2.0
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.las",
        "minor_version":4,
        "scale_x":"0.001",
        "scale_y":"0.001",
        "scale_z":"0.001",
        "extra_dims":"all"
    }
]
}

But I applied previous pipelines to identify where in the process I'm
missing:

L3_0.las +L3_1.las
|
(filters.merge) (1)
|
L3_0+L3_1.las
|
(filters.sample) (2)
|
L3_0+L3_1_sample_cada_4cm.las
|
(filters.elm+filters.outlier+filters.smrf) (3)
|
L3_0+L3_1_sample_cada_4cm_suelo.las
|
(filters.hag_delaunay+filters.sort,dimension:HeihtAboveGround,order:DESC)
(4)
|
L3_0+L3_1_sample_cada_4cm_suelo_dalaunay.las (Here is where I am)
|
(filteres.litree) (5)
|
L3_0+L3_1_sample_cada_4cm_suelo_dalaunay_litree.las (This is where I want
to arrive)

*Questions:*

1. What could I be doing wrong?
2. Does the "radius" option refer to the "spacing threshold" they talk
about in the paper? I set radios:2. May be I wil  a get a
3. I set the value of min_points to 3000, thinking that any cluster of
points better than that value would not be considered and would facilitate
the computation. I'm wrong?


I hope you can help me. I feel really confused.

Tthak you.

Ulises,

What version of PDAL are you using? I think this method will always be
fairly computationally complex, but we did have a nice speed-up with
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/3520 prior to the 2.4 PDAL release.

Radius is distance used to select a dummy point. We default to 100 m, the
same as is used in the paper. The purpose of the dummy point is to seed the
class of points that will NOT belong to the tree currently being segmented.

min_points is only used after the current tree has been clustered. If it's
too small, it is skipped. Changing the min_points will not speed things up
significantly.

I think the biggest opportunities for speeding computation would be to
downsample the data prior to running the filter or to tile the data into
smaller chunks. Whether that is a satisfactory solution for your workflow
or not is really up to you.

Oh, I see that the paper says "We then insert a dummy point n0 that is far
away (e.g., 100 m) from t0 into Ni."

Please, let me ask you a few questions:

1. Sampling a point inside a cube with a size of about 10 centimeters on
each side, would this seem like a good level of subsampling to you?

2. I could cut the cloud of points into tiles, but would something serious
happen if a tree is half in one tile and half in another?

3. Would each of the files for each tile be processed by batch processing?

Thanks you very much

Ulises

I have not thoroughly studied this topic and it will be data dependent, but
I would guess that this would still work quite well. You might just have to
experiment on a small patch to tune the settings to your liking before
expanding to the full scene.

Correct. In the best case, you'd have two correctly segmented half trees in
each tile that you'd need to stitch together somehow.

 Any batch processing or parallelization of your workflow will be external
to PDAL, but would be a reasonable approach to the problem.

Hi everyone,

The new version of pdal-parallelizer (v 2.0.1) is now available !

This new version includes a Python API (import pdal_parallelizer) which allows you to use the process-pipelines function directly in your Python code. Thanks to this, you can also specify a timeout value directly in the parameters of the function, which can be useful if you want to run several processes in a row without having to specify this value each time.

The API is documented in the new Read The Docs documentation available here : https://pdal-parallelizer.readthedocs.io/

Regards,
Cl?ment Alba

Subject: [pdal] Troubleshooting GDAL writer and "Grid width out of range."
Message-ID: <CAL-SYDx_vn+qwXkJzwebQa1q_qrkW5+1BSkC_nCs_v+7M34G_Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am having trouble figuring out where the problem is with a script I am
working on.

My goal is to rasterize a point cloud at different height ranges (i.e.
0-10m height above ground, 10.1-20m height above ground, etc.).

The point cloud stored HeightAboveGround to an extra dimension and I
confirmed that the values are correct by viewing in CloudCompare.

The steps I use are the following:

{'type':'readers.las', 'filename':input_las,
'extra_dims':'HeightAboveGround=float32'}
{'type':'filters.range', 'limits':'HeightAboveGround[0:10]'}
{'filename':band,'gdaldriver':'GTiff','output_type':'count','resolution':'1','type':'writers.gdal'}

This leads to a strange part. Mostly these steps work and produce rasters
that look how I expect at that height range. It has never failed on the
lowest height range, say 0-10m. However, on following height ranges, say
10-20m, I receive the following error:
"RuntimeError: writers.gdal: Grid width out of range."
I am not sure where in my process is triggering this error, since it works
on the prior height range. The range filter works at each height range,
even when the GDAL step fails. I confirmed this by writing the filtered
point clouds to disc instead of rasterizing them and viewing them in
CloudCompare.

I created another version of this same point cloud where the Z values were
replaced with HeightAboveGround using the ferry filter and then saved to
disc. When I change the range filter to select for Z instead of height
above ground, the raster step doesn't throw an error at any height range
and produces the results I expect. However, if I try to add these steps to
the pipeline when reading the original point cloud (read point cloud with
HeightAboveGround, ferry HeightAboveGround to Z, then range filter for Z
values), I still get the Grid width out of range error on the second height
range.

I tested one last thing. I wondered if there was some error with how my
script generated the height ranges. So I manually ran the filter at the
next increment (10-20m) and unfortunately still got the same error. This
scenario has me quite confused and I would appreciate any help and advice!
My best guess from my tests is that the problem lies with the GDAL step,
not prior.

Best regards,
Theo Hartsook

Try the --nostream option when running `pdal pipeline` and see if it will calculate grid extents for you. Additionally, make sure your limits aren't causing zero points to come through your filters.

Finally, take a look at filters.expression instead of filters.range, which was just added for PDAL 2.5 https://pdal.io/en/stable/stages/filters.expression.html The expression filter is more powerful than filters.range and probably easier to write.

Hope this helps,

Howard

Hi Howard,

Thank you for very fast reply. Unfortunately the --nostream option did not
help. I confirmed that my filters are returning points. As a workaround I
decided to generate a new copy of the point cloud each time and save it to
disc before creating the rasters. Thank you for sharing the
expressions filter, that will be a very useful tool!

Best,
Theo

Your specified resolution appears to be too small.
