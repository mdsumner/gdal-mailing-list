Subject: [pdal] Standardize on Boost 1.42+ 
Message-ID: <5AE4BF90-0CBE-49B7-A416-62028DA3DB67@gmail.com>

Michael,

Here's my failures on linux with boost 1.42:

/home/oracle/pdal/test/unit/pcinfoTest.cpp(159): error in "pcinfo_test_dumps": check Support::compare_text_files(outputTxt, Support::datapath("apps/pcinfo_schema.txt")) failed
/home/oracle/pdal/test/unit/pcinfoTest.cpp(165): error in "pcinfo_test_dumps": check Support::compare_text_files(outputTxt, Support::datapath("apps/pcinfo_stage.txt")) failed

ssh to oracle.hobu.biz with the username 'oracle' and our fabulous PDAL-wide password if you wish to look around

and on OSX with boost 1.47:

/Users/hobu/dev/git/pdal/test/unit/pcinfoTest.cpp:165: error in "pcinfo_test_dumps": check Support::compare_text_files(outputTxt, Support::datapath("apps/pcinfo_stage.txt")) failed

Support::compare_text_files in test suite not that instructive. Maybe these could be string comparisons with BOOST_CHECK_EQUAL?  I'm not quite sure what to do, as I can see you wouldn't want to barf 1000s of characters onto the console that doesn't tell you much about what's not equal anyway.

I would like to standardize on boost 1.42+ as our Boost requirement for PDAL.  If we really need something that is newer than that, we should copy it into our own namespace and plop it in #include <pdal/external/boost_something>.  Otherwise, we should do our best to get back to 1.42.  

Why 1.42?  That's what's available from package for Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu Natty Narwhal, which are popular "cutting edge"  Linux distros. Stabilizing on this version gets us much easier access to being in the DebianGIS packaging effort, which services both of these distributions.  It will make it easier to get solicit packaging help. Also, using an older boost won't raise up developer's hackles when they first embark on trying to get going with PDAL.

I'm at the airport ready to head home. Wifi not working here, so I'll
look at the 1.42 fails tomorrow I guess.

Compare-text-files was designed to do a compare that provided useful
output for debugging (line numbers as opposed to byte position, ignore
CRLFs, etc.)

Hi Michael and all,

I want to do more test on the writing and compressing function of the PDAL,
is here someone has some code for the testing?
I looked into the C# tutorial of libLAS,

using System;
using System.Text;
using LibLAS;

class Program
{
   static void Main(string[] args)

   {
       try
       {
           LASReader lasreader = new LASReader(@"F:\sample_in.las");
           LASPoint laspoint;
           LASHeader lasheader = lasreader.GetHeader();
           LASWriter laswriter = new LASWriter(@"F:\sample_out.las",
lasheader, LASReadWriteMode.LASModeWrite);
           Console.WriteLine("Number of points in file= {0}",
lasheader.PointRecordsCount);

           while (lasreader.GetNextPoint())
           {
               laspoint = lasreader.GetPoint();
               //Console.WriteLine(laspoint.X + "," + laspoint.Y + ","
+ laspoint.Z);
               laswriter.WritePoint(laspoint);
           }
       }
       catch (LASException e)
       {
           Console.WriteLine("\nLASException! Msg: {0}", e.Message);
       }
       catch
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Unknown exception caught");
       }
       finally
       {
           Console.WriteLine("Do i need something to do?");
       }

       Console.WriteLine("End of file");
       Console.Read();
   }
}

However, it is not working in the PDAL. Can someone help me on this?

What do you mean "a little bigger"?

> 2) Visualize the point cloud

There is a pcview application in pdal, but it is really only a sample app,
nothing useful for production work.

> 2) Do some filtering(vegetation or forest)

Is the las file already classified?  If so, that's an easy filter to write.

> 3) Write the points to a file

(working now)

> 4) compress the file

(working now)

We don't have DEM generation in pdal yet, but that is something we'd like to
have.  lastools has las2dem, but it is likely not open source.

> BTW, a powerful LiDAR viewer will be perfect, I tried the Lasview of
libLAS, it seems working very good, have you already implemented it?

libLAS doesn?t have a viewer as far as I know -- you probably mean the
viewer in lastools?  Here again, I'm not sure how much of that application
is open source.

You don't have to run 1.41 as your baseline. I'll keep the task of backporting stuff as necessary for 1.41 compatibility. In fact, it's probably better for us to run current stuff.

Hmm.  Well, I'd certainly prefer not to track more than one boost version,
so I'm happy with that.

But -- I assume because of boost stuff -- the filesystem tests are failing
on windows with the current boost, and I assume on the old boost too.
Assuming the fixes aren't the same for both, you don't want to the do
windows stuff do you?  Or are we okay ignoring the fails (dangerous, but
appealing)?

Assuming 1.46+ for windows would be fine for me. I just need the Linux distribution coverage for the older versions.

On http://pointcloud.org/, the "Mailing List" link on the left hand
navigation panel is broken.  It points to a
http://pointcloud.org/community.html page that doesn't exist.  Just
wanted to point that out.

 

Thanks,

Kip

Thanks Kip, 

Will fix as soon as I'm at a bash prompt.  It was great to meet with you.
