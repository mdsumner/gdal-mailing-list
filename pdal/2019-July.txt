Subject: [pdal] writers.gdal 'MEM' option
Message-ID: <CAHBsPR4-+T1T5gFpuFpkv7Vp27GOBoF9B_Uww+5KEt5gM0awPg@mail.gmail.com>

First of all, awesome software.  New PDALer here, and it's already doin'
great things!  Second, I've got a question about using writers.gdal with
the in-memory raster (MEM) driver.  Are there any special filename
considerations for that one?  I'm hoping to be able to create DEMs without
writing them to disk, to then be inputs to other processes (such as being
read by rasterio).

Thanks,
Nick

GDAL's VSIMem should do the trick, but that will only stay alive as long as the PDAL process does.

If you need something to live across processes, investigate named pipes and mkfifo.

Subject: [pdal] Eigenvalues for .las Data
Message-ID: <CAKJBVL3bAx6TAsu4WYVqcoOwaj2UJywkeDu_oNJkx2q+1SS0eA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I am wondering what matrix is passed into Eigen's SelfAdjointEigenSolver
<https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/classEigen_1_1SelfAdjointEigenSolver.html>
when filters.eigenvalues is called on a .las file. The filters.eigenvalues
documentation states that the decomposition is performed for each point
with knn nearest neighbors, but to my understanding decompositions can only
be performed on square matrices. I was originally imagining a matrix of
points like

[x0 x1 x2 x3 ... xknn]

]y0 y1 y2 y3 ... yknn]

[z0 z1 z2 z3 ... zknn]

but this would definitely not be square. Is it a covariance matrix for all
points, kind of analagous to PCA?

Best,

Joe Faraguna

It is the covariance of the XYZ coordinates alone.

Message-ID: <CAN9Cm==uLsYtd9qTAp26neq9ta08S-DVeDPOYW-X1cntxXYK5Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I am trying to get all the non- ground points into a different file. I am
using the below json. However, I found all the ground points also included
in the output.

[
"test_part.las",
{
      "type":"filters.range",
      "limits":"Classification![2:2]"
    },
{
        "type":"writers.las",
        "filename":"test_part_nonground.las"
    }
]

Could someone please explain what I am doing wrong?

Warm Regards,
Thejus

Dear all,
I would ask you if the filter.mongus is really deprecated or not, because I
tried to run a pipeline with this command but I got the following message:
"writers.las: legacy flags an extended flags are not identical".

Is this a problem of the data or the pipeline or is it because the filter
do not exists anymore and therefore the result is incompatible with the
writer?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Best regards

Silvia

It depends on how you've installed/what version of PDAL you are using.
Mongus was removed from the master branch with
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/pull/2516, but was still included in the
latest 1.9.x releases, where it was only "marked for deprecation."

I am using Pdal 1.8 in Conda,
I tried to update it with the last version using the command mentioned in
the documentation page but it would not get the new version.
Probably I should have to reinstall all the Conda environment or make
something special with the source packages, but I am not so smart to do
that and I really need to have a PDAL environment working, so, for the
moment I stopped at the 1.8... :-(

Do you think that the error message is due to the lack of the module?

Thanks a lot.

Silvia

I can't really speak to the error message you are seeing, but nothing about
it points to Mongus being the culprit. Mongus was 100% part of PDAL 1.8
anyway.

Thank Michael,
I tried different work around for the problem
1. writing the output of the filters.outliers with the flag "minor_version"
: 1
2. including the filters.outliers in the same pipeline, this would avoid
the reading and writing procedure
3. including the filters.outliers in the same pipeline, and changing one
parameter of the ouliers

But unfortunately nothing changed and I still have the same issue.

Thanks again for the help!

Silvia

Mike's response is correct.  This has nothing to do with mongus.  As the
message says, it's referring to an issue with reading your LAS input.  I
don't have anything to offer other than what has already been suggested in
https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/2410.

Anyway thanks for the help and quick response!

I will go on with the other filters (pmf and smrf) which seems to work well
with the same input data.

Thanks again!

Silvia

Oh, I missed that this is with the writer.  Apologies.

The broken LAZ compressor is sensitive to the data.  It doesn't have
anything to do with the specifics of the filter.  You could simply
rearrange the points and the problem might appear/disappear.  Still, the
only fix is to upgrade PDAL to work around the issue.  Sorry.

Thank you!
So I will try to change some parameter... let's try to find if it runs! :-D

Hi Karl,
i am also trying to use the PDAL to extract a good DTM with my data on a
mixed vegetated terrain.
I am new to PDAL so I can't really help you, but we could share a bit the
experience: commands, parameters and flowchart of the approach, what do you
think?

My own approach is the follow:
1. denoise the data: using filters.elm and filters.ouliers and after this
2. classify ground/no ground points: alternatively used filters.smrf,
filters.pmf and filters.mongus (this unfortunately still do not work on my
data, but I will try again to test it during the next week)
3. create the DTM: export the data with writers.gdal

The DTM I obtained is not really nice and I am trying to fix it by working
on the parameters and looking for further analysis to add. There are now
two possibilities:
A. try to clusterize as suggested by Howard: did you already tried? is this
a good solution for a good final product? which threshold of the dimension
of the cluster did you use to select the ground points to keep and ignore?
B. try to follow the instructions given by Luigi and do the following steps:
    - filters.pmf
    - calculate normalZ and assign: normalZ ! [0:0.6] : Classification ->2
    - calculate kDistance and assign: KD <1 : classification = 2
    - apply pmf again on the new dataset
The problem in the second case is to store the results and do the checks on
each point. I am blocked here because even if I can store the results in an
extra_dimension of the las, then I am not able to do the check on the
values in the interval [0:0.6] using PDAL and I don't have any other
possibilities for a separate software.
C. find a better solution for the final step: interpolation to create the
DTM, what do you use for this purpose?

I'll go on with some tests these days, finger cross!!!

Regards

Silvia

Hello Silvia,

Like you I am new to PDAL and have been trying to optimize the output and
filtering steps. As you suggested, I would also like to participate in a
collabration efforts to improve ground filtering efforts.

I have been looking at a similar approach as yours. I have a little
programming background, so am working on an automated process (custom or
using pipeline). From what I have seen, pmf & smrf tends to include the low
vegetation as ground points.
About clustering: I do not understand, how clustering would help with
classifying ground. With default settings, the whole file might end within
a single cluster. Best use I can think of is filtering the noise points.

I confess, I am not an expert and dont understand many of the Innards.

Can you explain what is normalZ and its relation to ground?

Let me know what you think.

Warm Regards,
Thejus

Subject: [pdal] Support for proj4 pipeline string in filter.reprojection
Message-ID: <CAL7JBY9Bxp4tCcXqLXik4akLCebySrP64TcO8o9FdJLu7AMXMw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello dear PDAL community,

I would like to reproject a point cloud using a proj4 pipeline string such
as the following :
"+proj=pipeline
+step +proj=pipeline +step +proj=merc +step +proj=axisswap +order=2,1
+step +proj=unitconvert +xy_in=m +xy_out=us-ft" (see
https://proj.org/operations/pipeline.html for more details)
Since version 3.0, GDAL support this feature in this CLI tools gdalwarp and
ogr2ogr. It would be nice to have the same feature in PDAL.
The OSR class CoordinateTransformation that is used by PDAL to accomplish
coordinates transformation, support this through the method
SetCoordinateOperation(). Thus, it should be easy to implement by modifying
the SrsTransform class and providing minor API modifications in the
re-projection filters (add of coordinates_operation option and out_srs will
be no longer mandatory when specifying a coordinates operation).
I would like to know if someone in the community is currently working on
that. If not, I could handle it myself and submit a PR soon.

Thanks in advance

Subject: [pdal] wrong classflags after crop
Message-ID: <CAD5u+KudCqkk0_A9E5HGtnoPWG2Q79TPuexFLehBh-VQRPnh1g@mail.gmail.com>

Dear List,

I'm trying to crop a point cloud in laz format with a polygon in pdal 1.8.0.

In the result I get some "withheld" and "keypoint" classified points which
were not classified as such in the original laz.

Any idea on why can this happen?

Tried to search for solution but I'm a very beginner in the pointcloud
world and maybe I'm missing the proper keywords.

This is my pipeline:

{
  "pipeline":[
    {
      "type":"readers.las",
      "filename":"43-233_dfm_2018.laz",
      "spatialreference":"epsg:23700"
    },
    {
      "type":"filters.crop",
      "polygon":"Polygon ((...))"
    },
    {
      "type":"writers.las",
      "filename":"cut_43-233_dfm_2018.laz",
      "forward": "major_version, minor_version, dataformat_id,
filesource_id, global_encoding, project_id, system_id, software_id,
creation_doy, creation_year, scale_x, scale_y, scale_z, offset_x, offset_y,
offset_z"

    }
  ]
}

Original and cropped file:

Thank you very much for any hint!

Do you get the same behavior without the crop fitter in the pipeline?

Subject: [pdal] LAS to PCD conversion by preserving original coordinates?
Message-ID: <CAPA7-NGSz1QaJz1ARMySmXW8YWcz3ZYfr3nBQPsO2qcpxrthpw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I need to convert files from LAS format into PCD format. I tried PDAL
<https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/250714/converting-las-to-pcd-file-using-pdal>,
but it doesn't preserve original coordinates in output file.

pdal translate input.las output.pcd

It changes coordinates from original (EPSG:28355) into some local
coordinates. Can someone help me to work around so I could get original
coordinates in output PCD file?
Thanks,

Best regards,
Shukhrat

We have a large dataset (working in Register 360/Leica Cyclone/ReCap) and need to provide it to our client in files less than 4GB. I noticed the hierarchyStep command, but not sure if that will do the trick. Any advice or examples would be greatly appreciated. I have some programming experience but I am new to Entwine.

It's not clear what you're trying to do.  Are you reading entwine?  If so,
what are you exporting and in what format?  Do you have a pipeline/command

I think your issue is this: https://github.com/LASzip/LASzip/issues/50 .
To verify, try writing your output as LAS rather than LAZ output.  If this
is indeed the problem, you can upgrade to PDAL 1.9, which works around the
LASzip issue.

Hmm, sorry for not being clear. Data is a site scan with hundreds of millions of points, much greater than 4GB total. We need to tile the scan data into e57 files less than 4GB each, per specs provided from our client.

Subject: [pdal] Reading asc or txt files
Message-ID: <CAKJBVL2j3YVn=rAPB=T5Ox-0sGZJRZ11HYcXA6+NtqyiEp7hjg@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to read asc or txt files into a pdal pipeline. The files are
structured with columns X Y Z Nx Ny Nz. Using txt2las from LAStools, I can
convert the files beforehand and then read them with "readers.las," but I
lose the normal vector information and also am curious if there is a way to
do this in pdal.

Thanks,

Joe

Can you simply use pdal tile:  https://pdal.io/apps/tile.html ?

PDAL will read text files.  You don't need to use txt2las. See:

Subject: [pdal] LAS to PCD conversion by preserving original coordinates?

Hi Shukhrat,

1) Many PCL algorithms are now implemented natively in PDAL, eliminating
the need to convert to PCD.
2) PDAL shifts points to use the minimum x/y/z of the original pointcloud
as the origin.  This is done because the standard point types in PCL are
single-precision, while PDAL stores point data in double-precision.
Without such a shift, significant and important precision would be lost for
some applications.  You can use the offset in the PCD writer to control
this behavior (provide the X/Y/Z minimum as the offset to get back to the
original locations).  You can also provide a scale factor to apply if
desired.
3) PCD has no concept of spatial reference.

If the provided output file extension is ".e57", PDAL will write E57 format.

I was just reminded that e57 support isn't in a released version of PDAL.
You can build master to get it or use a docker build of the current
repository state.

You can pretty easily convert from various PDAL supported formats to
Alembic using Houdini. We've started building some Houdini tools to
integrate PDAL and I'm halfway considering turning it in to a
full-blown GUI for PDAL.

Native support for Alembic inside of PDAL, for both point clouds and
meshes, would be pretty interesting though.

Thanks for the feedback Jed. Unfortunately we don't currently have a need for Houdini. Hopefully in the future though.

A gui for PDAL is not a bad idea.

I saw a post on Kitware's blog earlier this spring that the upcoming
release of Paraview would include PDAL readers and that they're hoping
to support constructing processing pipelines in the future, which
would be pretty cool.

That being said, conceptually Paraview is still essentially a linear
series of filters applied to a source data set. My ideal GUI for PDAL
would look a look a lot more like Houdini, namely a visual programming
environment for defining non-linear data execution graphs.

If you've got a couple hours to kill checkout the launch presentation
for the most recent version.

https://vimeo.com/322225534

The big new feature in that release was Procedural Dependency Graphs,
which is the first thing we're using with PDAL. The ability to easily
setup a graph that will create and execute PDAL pipelines using all
possible combinations of X filters with Y parameters each is a great
way to answer questions like "What are the best settings to use to
extract ground from my data set?" Just test them all and look at the
results.

Best,

Message-ID: <CAKyBbG4QMkukBK5oDHOxL9MjZFgD59NFp2LvFyoeV7P2ROhYPg@mail.gmail.com>

All,

I am proposing that we remove the SQLite drivers in the upcoming PDAL 2.0
release. I do not think these drivers are seeing much use, they do not have
a full featureset, and we are seeing some bugs creep in as PDAL interacts
with other software libraries that are using SQLite (notably GDAL).

The drivers have been their own little thing for quite a while and do not
seem to have taken off as a useful container format for point cloud data.
Given this experience, I would like to remove the burden of maintaining
from the project unless there are strong objections and corresponding
avenues of support to rally to keep it in the project.

If you have an objection, or are using this capability, we would really
like to hear about how you are using, and what it allows you to do that
cannot be achieved with some other format or approach.

Thanks,

Howard

Hello,
I hope you are doing well.
It has been hard for me to find a good example that shows me how to run a PDAL filter in batch mode (looping) using Python.
I have a set of LAS files in a directory and I want to be able to sort the points for each file by GPS time using a looping method in Python 2.7
Could anyone in the list help please?

Thanks in advance for your response.

Miguel

On second thought, we'll table the removal until 2.1 to allow a full
release cycle for everyone who might be impacted to catch up, but we will
still plan to remove these drivers. Again, if you are going to be impacted
by this change we would like to hear from you. We don't know of much use of
these drivers, and their continued maintenance burden does not seem worth
it given their limited use.

This question is very general.  Perhaps you should write a program to the
point where you have a specific problem where someone might help you.

Miguel,

You can embed a pdal pipeline in a Python program and execute the pipeline
on a directory of files.

The code below will sort each las file in the directory in which the Python
program is placed by its X dimension, overwrite the files with the sorted
output, and also print out a pandas DataFrame of each sorted output.

Best,

Joe

https://pdal.io/workshop/exercises/batch_processing/batch-processing.html <https://pdal.io/workshop/exercises/batch_processing/batch-processing.html> demonstrates some windows-based batch processing.

I would suggest using the 'pdal' command line utility along with filters.sort https://pdal.io/stages/filters.sort.html <https://pdal.io/stages/filters.sort.html> for operations and then using subprocess or python coroutines if you want to get fancy to drive it. If you don't need to access the points from numpy or geopandas directly, there is no reason to take on the burden of being in Python land for the point cloud operations.
