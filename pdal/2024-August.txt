Subject: [pdal] filters.python not available after install pdal and

Message-ID: <MEYPR01MB7640A7C11310A9639B6C8F6189812@MEYPR01MB7640.ausprd01.prod.outlook.com>

Hi,

Although I have the below two packages in my venv:

python-pdal 3.4.5 py312h61d12cd_4 conda-forge
pdal-plugins 1.5.2 pypi_0 pypi

I cant seem to find:

libpdal_plugin_filter_python.dll

in Library\lib and Library\bin of anaconda3\env. Using pdal --drivers confirms that I don't have filters.python which I would like to have to run a python function in a pipeline
{
                "type": "filters.python",
                "script": "WF_Desktop_YOLO_V5.ipynb",
                "function": "filter_by_treeID_min_z",
}

Does anyone know why I don't seem to have access to this plugin?

Thank you,
Dom

Subject: [pdal] serving Entwine Point Cloud
Message-ID: <CAJW_ZYWuibAO_2rnzuid9q_sXw0gH48PWbEoNS4H172qfh4X0Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

I?ve created a Virtual Point Cloud(VPC) of Wales using PDAL and related
tools, consisting of 27,000 tiles, each covering 1 km?. I?ve successfully
generated some large Entwine Point Cloud (EPT) files from this data, which
I can view through QGIS.

However, I?d like to explore the dataset using COPC Viewer and possibly
Potree, but I?m having trouble serving the data on a local server. My goal
is to host it locally to showcase just how impressive the dataset is.

I haven't got the grasp of servers and networks before,  I?ve tried
following various guides and using ChatGPT, but I think I might be missing
something simple as everything else has been relatively straightforward.
I?d prefer not to use a cloud service due to cost and bandwidth constraints.

Does anyone have suggestions on how to easily serve the data locally? I
have access to both a Windows Docker environment and a Linux Mint OS.

Thanks in advance!

Cheers,
Sion

I confirmed this is an issue.

The story is with how conda-forge registers where the plugin path. There has been some back and forth about how we should do that.

Here's one way you might be able to get it going:

print where your plugins live
> python -m pdal --pdal-plugin-path

set PDAL_DRIVER_PATH="result from above"

Another alternative might be something like this to keep the previous value of PDAL_DRIVER_PATH

> python -m pdal --pdal-plugin-path > pdal-plugin-path
> set /p PDAL_PLUGIN_PATH= < pdal-plugin-path
> DEL pdal-plugin-path

I'm tracking this issue at https://github.com/conda-forge/python-pdal-feedstock/issues/124

Hello Sion,
I was in Wales last month, I'd love to see some of the LiDAR! It's a
beautiful country.

To serve COPC local and/or remote (web server and cloud) I first downloaded
and built potree according to the docs - see Getting Started at
https://github.com/potree/potree
As per the docs I just upload the Potree folder with all point clouds, the
build directory, and your html files to a web server. You can optimize
things by deleting a lot of content from the potree directory such as demo
point clouds, shape files, example html, etc... I don't serve point clouds
from the web server filesystem as the storage is cheaper in a cloud bucket.

There is a copc.html example which you can use - just read through the
source and adapt for either a local path or an http URL. I put my copc
files in a google cloud bucket and then open the bucket up for CORS and
HTTP.
If you just want to try serving from the filesystem you could modify line
57: var path = "../pointclouds/lion_takanawa.copc.laz";  and drop your copc
file into the folder.

Here's an example of one of my copc files - this is a large area (15,000+
acres) but it's only the ground points.
https://mappalachian.info/potree/viewer/copc2.html?r=https://storage.googleapis.com/mappalachian-entwine/lickstone/Lickstone_Surface_MergedSlope.copc.laz.
It's 2.5GB. You can check the source of copc2.html to see what changes I
made. I will say that for very large copc files you can really hurt a
browser... (uses lots of memory) This example is about 250MB and it's much
more responsive.
https://mappalachian.info/potree/viewer/copc2.html?r=https://storage.googleapis.com/mappalachian-entwine/lickstone/NEPA_Unit_11_HAGDEM_EPSG3857.copc.laz

regards,
Nick

Cool i will give that a try, got a busy week working on a different
project. But will get some nice Pembrokeshire coastal data up for people to
view
