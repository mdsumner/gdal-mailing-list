Subject: [pdal] Invalid dimension name 'Pulse width'?
Message-ID: <CAOZzBDi9JF+JPAMZcxK-Q2gXUDb=UXut=F1VPCw=RKwQjtf_Hg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

The government of my country provides [1] LAZ files that PDAL apparently
does not like. I reported to them already, but can you help me to
understand what is the problem?

>pdal --version
pdal 2.2.0 (git-version: Release)

> pdal info --debug --summary 474658_2019_tava.laz

(PDAL Debug) Debugging...

(pdal info readers.las Debug) File contains both WKT and GeoTiff VLRs which
is disallowed.

(pdal info readers.las Error) GDAL failure (1) PROJ:
proj_create_from_database: crs not found

(pdal info readers.las Error) GDAL failure (1) PROJ:
proj_create_from_database: crs not found

*PDAL: Can't create dimension with invalid name 'Pulse width'.*


Is this a deviation from standard? Should it be 'PulseWidth' or
'pulse_width' or 'pulse width' or is there some other problem?

Hi Riivo,

There's nothing wrong with the name. PDAL doesn't support spaces in
dimension names, so it fails. We've seen spaces in dimension names in other
formats (BPF and text, for instance), but this is the first I can recall in
a LAS file. I'll open a ticket to add an option to allow PDAL to accept
this by replacing PDAL-invalid characters with a '_'.

You should be able to get PDAL to read the file for now by modifying it
with something like sed:

$ sed s/Pulse width/PulseWidth\000/ < infile.laz > outfile.laz

Hope that helps,

Subject: [pdal] Generation of tiff file stops half-way
Message-ID: <000601d6e3ca$d71f4ce0$855de6a0$@lim@gpslands.com>

Hi,



When I use Pdal to generate a tiff file from a laz file using the following
Json: 

[

    {

        "type":"readers.las",

        "filename":"somefile.laz"

    },

                                {

                                                "type":"writers.gdal",

                                                "resolution":0.04,

                                                "data_type":"uint16",

                                                "output_type":"mean",

                                                "dimension":"Intensity",

 
"gdalopts":"COMPRESS=DEFLATE,ZLEVEL=9,NUM_THREADS=10000,TILED=YES",


 
"filename":"compressed/CR_03C_BS, Tile 0168.tif"

                                }                              

]

 

I have the following message:

 

proj_create_from_database: datum not found

proj_create_from_database: ellipsoid not found

proj_create_from_database: prime meridian not found

proj_create_from_database: datum not found

proj_create_from_database: ellipsoid not found

proj_create_from_database: prime meridian not found

PDAL: readers.las: reading point 50000 of 176406445 total points 

 

and Pdal just stops half-way.

 

No tif file is generated.  May I know what is the issue.

 

 

Thank you.

 

Best Regards,

 

Peter Lim

Perhaps there's something wrong with the input? Perhaps you should use
lasinfo or pdal info to check the file as a start.

Good luck,

Hi Andrew,

 

Using pdal info also gives the same output message.  

 

Anyway for Pdal to output what could be the possible errors in the laz file..

 

 

Thank you.

If you get the same message reading, it?s likely that the file is corrupted. Do you have a backup or a way to get a new copy?

Thank you Michael for the advice.

 

I used the ??debug? option and Pdal output an additioinal message:

?(pdal info readers.las Debug) File contains both WKT and GeoTiff VLRs which is disallowed.?

 

Could this be the reason?

 

The file(in different drive, but deleted) was able to be imported by another software, 

so I?m wondering if is the process of copying to another location that corrupt the file?

 

Thank you.

I have the following message:

No tif file is generated.  May I know what is the issue?

 

 

Thank you.

Thank you Michael for the advice.

 

I used the ??debug? option and Pdal output an additioinal message:

 

?(pdal info readers.las Debug) File contains both WKT and GeoTiff VLRs which is disallowed.?

 

Could this be the reason?

 

The file(in different drive, but deleted) was able to be imported by another software, 

so I?m wondering if is the process of copying to another location that corrupt the file?

 

Thank you.

If you get the same message reading, it?s likely that the file is corrupted. Do you have a backup or a way to get a new copy?

Hi Andrew,

 

Using pdal info also gives the same output message.  

 

Anyway for Pdal to output what could be the possible errors in the laz file..

 

 

Thank you.

Perhaps there's something wrong with the input? Perhaps you should use lasinfo or pdal info to check the file as a start.

 

Good luck,

Hi,

When I use Pdal to generate a tiff file from a laz file using the following Json:

        "type":"readers.las",

Hi Andrew, 

I have run into the same problem with PDAL with the Pulse width dimension.
I'm quite new with PDAL, can you please elaborate a bit on how to use the
sed command that you mention in your solution. I assume that it changes the
dimension name to something which is supported? 

This is my pipeline: 

{
  "pipeline":[
	{
    	"type":"readers.las",
    	"filename":"placeholder1.laz"
	},    
	{
  	"type":"writers.gdal",
  	"filename":"placeholder2.tif",
  	"dimension":"Intensity",
  	"data_type":"UInt16",
  	"output_type":"max",
  	"resolution": 0.20,
      "gdalopts":"COMPRESS=DEFLATE"
	}
  ]
}


Thanks! 

Usman
