Luca,

I can't think of anything specific in PDAL other than some of the neighborhood metrics that you might use to help you combine into something that you then jump to Python to implement.

There's probably not much you can do without more resolute data like LiDAR. Maybe you can use 2d imagery and some kind of machine learning or transfer classification to hint whether or not you are in a vineyard, which would help limit your processing.

But you are right that the challenge is getting your ground points correctly classified. Most of the algorithm development in this space has been focused on true 3D data from LiDAR. 2.5+D data from photogrammetry may require other approaches. One possible venue that I?ve had surprisingly good results from is geomorphons:

I was following this solution (thanks to Doug Newcomb for the
suggestion), I'm able to find the pixel of the row (looking only for
summit, but I could consider also ridge), now the problem is to
convert the pixel in a vector line, I tried few methods but all of
them failed because the create a lot of short segments

sorry I don't understand what did you combine and in which step.

Subject: [pdal] reader.e57 and spherical coordinates
Message-ID: <DM6PR18MB2428A002A965E6AADA55F3BDE4609@DM6PR18MB2428.namprd18.prod.outlook.com>

Hello PDAL community,
Do you have any suggestions when working with e57 files stored with spherical coordinates for pythonic workflows with pipelines?  I have as a data source E57 files (one scan position per file) exported from the Leica Cyclone product and I have confirmed that the coordinates are stored as spherical coordinates.  I see the note in PDAL 2.3.0 documentation that, "Point clouds stored in spherical format are not supported."
Is there a programmatic solution to reading these files other that converting the e57 to LAS/LAZ as a preprocessing step?
Thanks,
Chris Siebern, PS PE

Subject: [pdal] New Python API Released
Message-ID: <142034F2-5052-4C86-A480-0FEF52C7D919@hobu.co>

All,

George Sakkis from TileDB has contributed a new PDAL Python API (version 3.0.1) that has been recently released. Big thanks to TileDB <https://tiledb.com/> for the effort to enhance the PDAL Python extension to support streaming, composable pipelines, and refactor it to use pybind11.

The feature list can be found at https://github.com/PDAL/python/releases/tag/3.0.0 <https://github.com/PDAL/python/releases/tag/3.0.0> but is included here for convenience.
> PDAL plugins (filters.python and readers.numpy) have been moved to their own package at https://github.com/PDAL/python-plugins <https://github.com/PDAL/python-plugins> and https://pypi.org/project/pdal-plugins/ <https://pypi.org/project/pdal-plugins/>
> PDAL extension has been converted to use pybind11 instead of Cython
> Support for composable pipelines <https://github.com/PDAL/python#programmatic-pipeline-construction>. For example, a caller can construct a pipeline and sort it using pure Python such as:
> pipeline = pdal.Reader("1.2-with-color.las") | pdal.Filter.sort(dimension="X")
> Convenient cycling between PDAL and Python Numpy is now possible. See https://github.com/PDAL/python#reading-using-numpy-arrays <https://github.com/PDAL/python#reading-using-numpy-arrays> for details
> Chunked or streamed operations are now possible from Python. See https://github.com/PDAL/python#executing-streamable-pipelines <https://github.com/PDAL/python#executing-streamable-pipelines> for details
> meshio support https://github.com/PDAL/python#meshio-integration <https://github.com/PDAL/python#meshio-integration>
> pdal.pio has been removed. This is superseded by the composable pipeline support

Visit https://pypi.org/project/PDAL/ <https://pypi.org/project/PDAL/> to see examples of how to compose and stream with the new API. CondaForge packages will be building soon for those not wanting to build their own from source. The new PDAL Python API is backward compatible with currently released PDAL 2.3.0, and you should be able to start using it today.

Thanks again George and TileDB!

Howard
