Subject: [pdal] "resolution" keyword in

Hi - thanks for the responses.  Basically, I'm trying to develop a workflow
to calculate the number of points per class in a given ept dataset. My
experience is that the `pdal info --stats` command will read all of the
data into memory and will not work on large ept files (like the usgs lidar
datasets).  Conor helped me out and suggested that I could use the
"resolution" flag to estimate the number of points at a given level in the
ept structure, and I've done that with a resolution = 50. So, for example,
I have run a query like:

pdal info --stats --filters.stats.dimensions=Classification
--filters.stats.count=Classification ept://
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/USGS_LPC_MD_VA_Sandy_NCR_2014_LAS_2015
--readers.ept.resolution=50
--readers.ept.threads=12

I'm trying to understand if the counts I get per classification is
representative of a 50 m^2 area?  It seems like from the documentation (and
Jim's answer), that it is trying to take data at the octree level that is
closest to the specified resolution.  So, is there a way I can "back out"
the point totals per classification to get a representative count per
classification for the entire dataset?  Is there a way to calculate what
the actual returned resolution level is?  Currently I am just taking a
ratio between total count of the entire dataset to returned count from the
subset dataset using the "resolution" flag.  I then apply that ratio to the
different class counts to get a rough estimate of points per classification
for the entire dataset.  This is certainly not the best method as it will
over-estimate some of the classification totals.

Thanks for your help.

matt.

I find this confusing.  Perhaps you can strace the python invocation and
determine the syscall that's failing?  I can't help thinking this is still
a filename or path issue, because things work fine through pdal info and
the stage is invoked and run through the python interface but the file
itself seems not to be loaded.  I'll do something to improve the error
message, but I don't know when the change would make it into a conda build.

Just thinking about possible errors on Linux that can seem
random/impossible: Could there be a mismatch between the installed
python-pdal version and the pdal library versions? Could there be a
AppArmor/SELinux/etc. restriction that would depend on what program is
running?

Subject: [pdal] Memory management with PDAL/Docker
Message-ID: <CACrek74eDF6nouhe32oBoRQNR7D2GKdHUwVY+wfHrv1pN0MwSQ@mail.gmail.com>

Is there a way to optimize docker or PDAL to be able to run larger queries
on ept files?  Or Is there some info about memory management, or some
settings I should be using to facilitate larger queries?  I have been
trying to run a test on the JSON pipeline below, and I am only able to get
it to run successfully if I set my docker memory to over 6GB....anything
less than 6GB will fail.  When successfully run, the resulting LAZ file is
only about 150 million points - so, not huge by lidar standards.    I've
tried increasing the "threads" keyword to the ept reader, but that didn't
seem to help.

{
    "pipeline": [{
        "type": "readers.ept",
        "filename": "
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/USGS_LPC_HI_Oahu_2012_LAS_2015
",
        "bounds": "([-17606581.532235783,
-17598784.955350697],[2441398.6834285296,2448889.512200477])"
    },
    {
        "type" : "writers.las",
        "filename": "HI_LargeOutput_Local.laz"
    }]}

Any ideas would be appreciated.

Thanks!

This isn't surprising.  150 million points at even 30 bytes per point (and
it's more than 30 bytes per point) is 4.5 gig.  Until the EPT reader
supports stream mode, you're not going to be able to get around this
limitation with PDAL.  There are no EPT options you can set that will
change this.

Hi Andrew.

Thanks for the response.  Are there plans to implement the streaming option
to the EPT reader?  If so, do you have a feel for the timeline?  6 months?
a year?  I know it is hard to estimate, but I was just curious.

thanks.

Hi Matt

I see you have a pretty big area (are those US feet or metres?) specified
down to nanometre (nanofoot?) precision - can you divide-and-conquer? this
would be my approach

Cheers

Adam

It's on the list but not a high priority as it's not a need of our sponsor
at this time.  I don't have an estimate for completion.

Message-ID: <CABCykqLRrjxB6t0rEaBY_Kfrjh-EV+pPGg1rgURLqbveV=NDxw@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
sorry for bothering you...
I am trying to start to test some of the PDAL tools with my LiDAR data on a
windows10 machine using the package contained in OSGEO4W.
Unfortunately, I have some problems with the first commands... for example:
1. pdal density seems to not be present on this installation because the
message in the console is (PDAL Error) Command 'density' not recognized
even if I just try to do "pdal density --help"

2. PCL filters also are not installed and I can not understand how to
install this support or if it should be already installed...

Sorry again for these basic questions, but I am really at the beginning and
I tried to search in the archive of the mailing list without understanding
where are my problems.. :-(

Thanks in advance for any help.

Regards

Silvia

I could be wrong, but I don't think that PCL was ever part of the osgeo4w
install, which means you'd have to install it separately and rebuild PDAL
from scratch to access the PCL capabilities.

Have you tried the conda steps found in our quickstart? It's a more
complete, and frankly easier to use way of getting up and running on
Windows.

Hi Silvia

The page here: https://pdal.io/download.html

has a handy chart about what plugins are installed with PDAL on different
platforms: https://pdal.io/download.html#binaries

For available applications, type ‘pdal’ on the command line with no
options, and get (among other things) a list like:


The following commands are available:

  - delta

  - diff

  - fauxplugin

  - ground

  - hausdorff

  - info

  - merge

  - pcl

  - pipeline

  - random

  - smooth

  - sort

  - split

  - tile

  - tindex

  - translate

(from Conda, maxOS X).

On my natively-installed linux box, that list includes '- density’.

Unfortunately not all features are included on all builds - I’m certain
there are good reasons ( there may be ogr2ogr issues in windows and conda? )

Brad was faster to type (thanks!)

hopefully this also helps

regards

Thank very much to all for answering...
I am just scared about installing Conda... I just had a look at the links
from the quickstart and they are not yet available.

I will try now to install and run Conda... finger crossed!!

Starting in the 1.9 release (which should go final this week), the PDAL team will not be putting forward releases to OSGeo4W. We will only be making Win64 releases to Conda Forge moving forward. This is due to the Conda Forge having more institutional support, an easier on-boarding, and a flexible installation model. As a developer, OSGeo4W is also a target that moves around quite a bit, but Conda does on that account as well.

If you're just starting, start with Conda :)

Thanks again,
I just installed Anaconda3 on my PC and it seems to work, I installed pdal
in it and this is the version:
pdal --version
pdal 1.7.2 (git-version: Release)

I just checked and realized that nor density or PCL are included in this
installation too... is there a way to use the PCL filtering?

In addition, if I try pdal --drivers I get an exception: Impossible to find
the initial point (not sure if this is the correct sentence because I
translated this from Italian message...).

pdal --help also gives the same exception but it prints something in the
console, in particular:
The following commands are available:
  - delta
  - diff
  - ground
  - hausdorff
  - info
  - merge
  - pipeline
  - random
  - sort
  - split
  - tindex
  - translate

Did I missed something during installation or this is the standard
installation for running pdal with Conda in Windows?

Thanks and sorry again for the questions...

Silvia

Let us know the exact commands you used to install via Conda. It should
have installed PDAL v1.8. I'm wondering if you installed to a conda
environment, but have not activated it yet, hence it's picking up your
previous OSGeo4W attempt.

Thanks Bradley,
I followed the instruction on line and did this command:
conda create --yes --name myenv --channel conda-forge pdal

and also the
conda update pdal
which gives to me an error...

Now that I was searching the output of the conda install I found that
perhaps it is necessary to activate my environment? Is this what you mean
in your email?

This is the command:
conda activate myenv

and then I can use pdal in the Anaconda Promt with the same syntax as in
the manual?

Thanks again

Silvia

Yes, exactly - activate first, before trying any PDAL commands. Let us know
if this works for you.

ok, it works now, PCL is present but not the density...
The following commands are available:
  - delta
  - diff
  - fauxplugin
  - ground
  - hausdorff
  - info
  - merge
  - pcl
  - pipeline
  - random
  - smooth
  - sort
  - split
  - tile
  - tindex
  - translate

pdal --version
pdal 1.8.0 (git-version: Release)

Is this correct? So I am now able to go on trying to add some filers to my
data for a good DTM... any suggestions?

Silvia

Density not being available is a bug in 1.8.0 that will be fixed in 1.9 when it is released at the end of the week.

If you specify a resolution of 50 to the EPT reader, the EPT reader will
determine a minimal octree depth such that this depth provides a precision
at *least* as precise as what you've specified.  Because EPT is an octree
structure with discrete precision steps, the returned precision will likely
be more precise than your request.  The nomenclature of the 'resolution'
option was lifted from the GDAL writer (
https://pdal.io/stages/writers.gdal.html#writers-gdal), where it represents
a spacing value - so a smaller value means *more* precision.

That means that for your request of resolution=50, the EPT reader is
selecting the minimum octree depth such that the octree cell width is less
than 50 units.

So your query will capture at least one point for every 50x50x50 unit
volume, if data exists in that volume.  I wouldn't say that this is
representative of that 50m^3 volume - only that you're guaranteed to have
at least one point from this volume if one exists.

If you run your pipeline with `--debug` you can see logs of the actual
resolution used for the query as well as the corresponding octree depth.

The resolution for each depth can be determined by the bounds (
https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html#bounds) and the span (
https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html#span).  At every subsequent
depth, the bounds are bisected into octants although the number of grid
cells remains constant, effectively doubling the precision in each spatial
dimension.

Hopefully this helps to clarify things.

Thanks!

Last question for today... promised...
how can I insert the path of a las in a pipeline json file (using Conda in
windows)?

it is quite impossible for me to change the folder in the Anaconda Promt
with the standard CD ... so I am forced to work in the main user folder.
My data are on an hard disk: F:\

So in the json file with the script I inserted the following path:
F:/2019_project/pdal/test_data/D_Geologie.las

but I get this error:
PDAL: PCL pipeline: Unable to parse pipeline file:
* Line 1, Column 1
  Syntax error: value, object or array expected.

James -
I'm currently running python-pdal version 2.1.8    and    pdal version
1.8.0. Not sure if those are mismatched or where I would check that. Conda
doesn't seem to report any issues.

Andrew -
I get the following traceback which is what I attempted to use to
understand the file structure on the Github. However, it doesn't seem very
verbose.

Hi all,
sorry for continuous questions...
I installed Anaconda and then pdal on my Linux PC in office and here (with
pdal 1.8 version) it seems to have density but not the PCL filtering, could
it be right?

Regarding my previous question about the path, do you have any idea on
which is the error?

Thanks

Silvia

Hi Silvia

Conda installs should have the PCL plugin installed - what are you trying
to run?

---
but I get this error:
PDAL: PCL pipeline: Unable to parse pipeline file:
* Line 1, Column 1
  Syntax error: value, object or array expected.
—

this looks like a JSON formatting error - If you’re able to provide a
pipeline JSON example that might be useful

Cheers

Adam

Hi Adam,
sorry, I just solved the problem with Linux machine... I had an old alias
calling the Docker installation... sorry for the confusion.

Regarding windows, here is the pipeline JSON, I just copied it from the
tutorial...

{
"pipeline":[
"F:/2019_didalos/pdal/test_data/D_Geologie_Rundschuhhof_SolarTirol.las",
{
"type":"filters.pclblock",
"filename":"passthrough.json"
},
"foo.las"
]
}

All is saved in the passthrough.json file.

Silvia

good to hear conda is working. I think the PDAL error refers also to the
json config file for PCL, sorry I didn’t pick that up earlier - look also
at the syntax of ‘passthrough.json’

Hi Silvia

to clarify - the ‘passthough.json’ file I’m referring to, which needs
checking, is the one which is passed to ‘filters.pclblock’:

{
"type":"filters.pclblock",
"filename":"passthrough.json"
},

hope that helps

Silvia,

It has been a long time since I've worked with any of the PCL filters. If
this isn't working as documented, we should take a closer look at both the
code and the documentation. In the meantime, two things you could try.

1) Instead of passing in the filename of the PCL JSON pipeline, copy and
paste the PCL pipeline you are trying to run into the PCL Block methods
option. An example of this is shown at
https://pdal.io/tutorial/pcl_spec.html?highlight=pcl#examples.

2) Don't use PCL if you don't have to. In modern PDAL, we can do almost all
of the older PCL functions using built-in filters. For example, you can
replace PCL's passthrough with PDAL's range filter. There are a few
lingering PCL capabilities that are not replicated, but they should be few
and far between.

Brad

Hi Bradley and Adam,
I think I am messed up...
What I would like to do using PDAL is to extract a good DTM from my LiDAR
data.
I have very high resolution LiDAR data on different test areas (with
vegetation cover, ...) and would like to understand if there are tools that
can extract a good the DTM. I already tried to use the pdal ground but the
results can be improved so I thought that the PCL was a way to obtain
better results. Isn't it?

Unfortunately I think that I didn't understand well how the pipelines work
in pdal because if I try to use the pdal pcl command as follow:

pdal pcl -i /media/hydrologis/BRENTA/2019_didalos/pdal/test_data/mydata.las
-o
/media/hydrologis/BRENTA/2019_didalos/pdal/test_data/mydata_ground_pcl.las
-p sor-pmf.json

creating the sor-pmf.json file as follow:

{
  "pipeline": {
    "name": "Progressive Morphological Filter with Outlier Removal",
    "version": 1.0,
    "filters": [{
        "name": "StatisticalOutlierRemoval",
        "setMeanK": 8,
        "setStddevMulThresh": 3.0
      }, {
        "name": "ProgressiveMorphologicalFilter"
    }]
  }
}

I can not obtain any result... the output file is empty and in addition, if
I try to add the -v4 to the command line I get this error:

PDAL: kernels.pcl: Unexpected argument '-v'.

Could you please help me understanding what I am doing wrong and what is
better to use to extract a DTM from my data?
I also saw that there are other filtering drivers like the SMRF, I didn't
read the documentation until now, but is there an alternative to the PCL? I
choose the PCL because it was the first one for which I found a scientific
documentation...

Hope you can help me.

Regards

Silvia

Hi Silvia

Bradley will have a more precise answer about the relationship between PCL
and PDAL; PDAL’s filters.pmf (
https://pdal.io/stages/filters.pmf.html#filters-pmf) is also an
implementation of the PMF you found in PCL (Zhang et al 2003)

I usually use filters.smrf:
https://pdal.io/stages/filters.smrf.html#filters-smrf …which is is based
on: https://pdal.io/references.html#pingel2013

Parameters for ground extraction might need to change based on what the
data contain, eg houses or large sheds or forests or a mix.

It’s really worth taking the time to step through the PDAL workshop
materials, I go through them all the time to find stuff even though I’ve
taught the material before!

https://pdal.io/workshop/index.html
…and maybe this page on constructing a ground classification pipeline will
help:
https://github.com/adamsteer/f4g-oceania-pdal/blob/master/workshop/3-pipelines.md

Adding on to Adam's comments:


It also helps a lot to read the paper on SMRF:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258333806_An_Improved_Simple_Morphological_Filter_for_the_Terrain_Classification_of_Airborne_LIDAR_Data


Which has the range of values for slope, window, elevation threshold and scaling factor that are effective for different types of areas. They can serve as good starting points for parameterizing the filter and save you a lot of time.


Cheers,

Best,

Steve

I've encountered an issue while trying to run pdal info

Relevant code:
import pdal
pdal info C:\workspace\GP\GP\inputs\20180623_JK_LCO_dpc_export.laz

Error
  File "C:\workspace\GP\GP\GP_7_pointclouds.py", line 27

            ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

I'm fairly new to PDAL (and conda), so after several hours searching the
PDAL documentation and examples for solutions, any suggestions would be
welcome!

(I'm using PDAL 1.8.0 with python-pdal 2.1.8, installed via conda ('conda
install -c conda-forge pdal python-pdal') in a dedicated environment with
python 3.6.5 on a Win10 OS platform).

Thanks

can you share the GP_7_pointclouds.py code? I suspect it's a simple indent
error related with python syntax, nothing related with pdal

Thanks Luigi,

That could be the case, but the same issue occurs even if there are no
indents and only two lines of code. The .py file is attached.

It is like PDAL is not imported correctly, but conda install reports both
'pdal' and 'python-pdal' are already installed, and the IDE (PyCharm) flags
no issue with 'import pdal'.

Regards,
Andy

pdal info is meant to be run from the command line, not Python. I would
encourage you to read the docs to discover what is possible in both
approaches.

Does the directory /tmp/SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL exist after running?  Do you
find a directory called SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL anywhere on your system?

Subject: [pdal] PDAL Release 1.9 RC2
Message-ID: <CACJ51z1otFfiS1OY0ocMmFd-BqEDrqxfcXE0EqYeHoi7cwNxnQ@mail.gmail.com>

We have released a second release candidate for PDAL, version 1.9 RC2.
This code will become the 1.9 release if no issues are found in the next
few days.

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/1.9rc2

Changes since 1.9RC1 are:

- enhanced version/feature detection for mixed python 2/3 installations,
which only impacts those building from source
- a change of compression type for TileDB tests that fixes a failure
running TileDB tests on Ubuntu 18.04.

Please write with questions or issues,

Does the directory /tmp/SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL exist after running?  Do you
find a directory called SMALL_AUTZEN_LAS_ALL anywhere on your system?

Message-ID: <CABCykqKR+wF_Esjh94+Q2C2ge_ST8MoD=Rqng_NJbVPXs0RfUg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
is there someone who is working with point cloud data to extract the DTM in
areas with high vegetation cover?
Do you have experience on which of the different filters available in the
PDAL is better to use? which values of the parameters did you use?

Do you know if there are papers available on applications on these use
cases?

Any suggestion is appreciated! :-D

Regards

Silvia

Hi silvia

with my limitated experience in this area I would do

1) filter only last points
2) filter with pmf or smpf... and here you have to play with parameters
reading experience, there is no a generic set of parameters, because they
depend on the size of objects you want to "remove", sensor noise, terain
conformation and point of view espect the terrain

=> you have to check the parameters :(

you can read may papers related with pmf... no idea about papers specific
to high vegetation cover.

cheers

Luigi Pirelli

Thanks Luigi,
it is exactly what I am doing, but regarding filters, I noticed that there
are many other filters and I was wondering if there were something else to
use specifically for vegetation or dense cover.

I am also reading some papers, it is hard to find specific tests on
vegetation, the buildings seems to be more interesting!!! :-D

Hear you soon!!
Ciao

Silvia

I would say to filter later hag to remove spikes and isolated maximum, e.g
fopr example nndistance (in 1.9) help to remove last return points that
belongs to trees

just my 2c

Correct, there is no PDAL filter to isolate vegetation points amongst those
classified as non-ground. Other filters, as suggested, may help to
discriminate between buildings and trees, or misclassified non-ground. I've
not done a lot of dense vegetation testing, but both PMF and SMRF should do
reasonably well as long as points are making it all the way to the ground
in the input data. Those filters, in my experience, struggle more with
manmade structures than they do with vegetation.

You don't need to use the -f option explicitly.  You just provide a list of
filenames:

Hi,
If you do use -f, I imagine (educated guess) that the file format will be a straight text file you can write with notepad, vim or notepad++.   Normally, these things have one file name on each line like:
C:\lidar\1.las
C:\lidar\2.las
...

If that does not work, try a front slash /.  If that does not work, it could be the line end character.  They are different on windows or Unix based systems.

Using PDAL merge with a very long list may crash on a Windows prompt if the list is too long.

The option has nothing to do with the file type. The file types are
inferred from the extensions.

Sorry the option is confusing.

All pdal arguments can be specified using options, even if they also
support positional behavior.  In this case, the following are equivalent:

pdal merge in1.las in2.txt in1.bpf out.txt
pdal merge -f "in1.las in2.txt in1.bpf out.txt"
pdal merge --files "in1.las in2.txt in1.bpf out.txt"
pdal merge --files="in1.las in2.txt in1.bpf out.txt"

Hope that helps,

Good to know.
I had problems with Gdal when I had too many files specified in the command line.  I deduced the problem was with the max memory of characters of dos command prompt can handle.  It would be nice to have a option with a txt file list.  I imagine someone will have the same problem I had.
Cheers

Ah, I understand what you're getting at.  The merge command does the same
thing as a simple pipeline.  You should be able to extend the pipeline to
any length.  Here is a pipeline that does the same thing as the commands
below:

[
  "in1.las",
  "in2.txt",
  "in1.bpf",
  "out.txt"
]

If this pipeline is called merge.json, you can get the same behavior with

pdal pipeline merge.json

Best,

Message-ID: <BYAPR11MB2727D4C20FC1AC72F721838C9A3D0@BYAPR11MB2727.namprd11.prod.outlook.com>

Good morning,

I have a question about applying rasters to point clouds.  Before I created a TIF, I classified the ground, curvature, height above ground, and normalized intensity.  I then exported it as a tif (resolution = 0.1 m, average, etc) without the ground.  I then combined the three aforementioned attributes and used some image segmentation techniques to separate the objects in the scene.  I now have a labeled raster of my objects (they are not yet classified, just segmented).  Is there a way to then apply a label (as opposed to a class) on the points?  I know you can colorize with a raster or even if I turned it into a shapefile I can then classify that way, but I'm not quite at that level.  I looked through the dimension list  (https://pdal.io/dimensions.html) and didn't see one that would fit for what I'm looking for.  Can I create a dimension and then apply the label?  If you need further clarification I can provide it.  Thanks!

Steve

Steven,

filters.colorization is really just a poorly named filters.overlay for raster

https://pdal.io/stages/filters.colorization.html#filters-colorization <https://pdal.io/stages/filters.colorization.html#filters-colorization>


Something like this might work. Use colorization to grab the first band value and stick it in GPSTime (a dimension of type double that should exist in a default LAS schema). Then copy that over to a dimension called "Segmented". Further processing can use the "Segmented" dimension as needed.

Hope this helps,

Howard

Hi,

I'm trying to make use of reader.tindex in pipeline as a way to access the point cloud without dealing with the underlying tiles but I do not seem to be able to get a valid output (an 633bytes laz).
Could you tell where I am wrong ?

The tindex as been created with the following command with pdal 1.9 (conda) :
pdal tindex create --tindex "index_2154.sqlite" -f "SQLite" --lyr_name index_2154 --t_srs ESPG:2154 --filespec "..\tiles\*.laz"

Here a pipeline with three stages, readers.tindex > filters.crop > writers.las (I've tried with readers.tindex.wkt too) :

Message-ID: <CABCykq+=DeAbFc+52rb98iSipQ7ZSPDPBjcHLCt0KFSF2uWcXg@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,
I am trying to extract the DTM from a point cloud of a terrestrial LiDAR.
Points of the survey are all of one single return and do no have a
classification.
To go on with the elaborations I guess that I have to assign a
classification of the points otherwise the tools (filter.smrf) do not work,
is this true?
I tried to use the command filters.assign with the following statement in a
pipeline (json file).

{
          "type":"filters.assign",
    "assignment":"Classification[:]=0"
        },

But  got this error:
PDAL: filters.assign: Invalid dimension name in 'assignment' option:
'Classification'.

Do some of you understand which is the problem?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Silvia

Thanks Luigi,
you are perfectly right... this is a print of the details of first point:
"point":
    {
      "Blue": 155,
      "Green": 153,
      "Intensity": 2497,
      "PointId": 0,
      "Red": 159,
      "X": 63.45360184,
      "Y": 0.0307,
      "Z": 0
    }

So now I should create the field for the classification, any idea?

Thanks again!

Silvia

Thanks a lot Luigi!
I added this to the pipeline:
{
          "type": "filters.ferry",
          "dimensions": "=>Classification"
   },
and now it seems to proceed!

Thanks again for the big help!

Silvia,

There's been discussion about changing the assignment filter to
automatically create dimensions.  I believe that my reasoning when I
decided against that was that it might create hard-to-find errors due to
misspellings.  In retrospect, it may have been the wrong decision.

It took me a little bit of digging when I first tried something similar to
understand the schema was explicit in pdal (unlike in json) and that
filters.ferry was used to change it.  Now that I know, it isn't a problem,
and I do like the typo safety aspect of the current behavior.

Maybe the solution is as simple as adding a note to the filters.assign docs
that says "If you intend to assign to a new dimension, that dimension needs
to be created first with filters.ferry."

Thank you all,
sorry Andrew, it is not your fault, it is me, that do not know PDAL very
well and therefore I was missing this step.
As suggested by James, it would be enough to add the note to use
filters.ferry.
Unfortunately, or lucky, PDAL have a lot of commands but it is not sto easy
to go through all of them to understand what they do and if there could be
something else usable for your personal case...

The mailing list is in any case very responsive and helpful.

PS: I saw that there are not so many (2-3) proposals for presentations at
FOSS4G in Bucharest, did someone proposed also a workshop? it would be
interesting to know.

Thanks again for all!

Silvia

What kind of documentation/example would you have found helpful for your
task?

I really like the tutorial, but at the same time the alphabetic order of
commands is the real source of knowledge. :-D
I think there should be a structure in the division of the commands... or
better, an improved structure with a search engine where one can navigate
the commands to find what needed.
But this is only my opinion... I can also help you doing something if you
need, even if my English and my knowledge of PDAL are limited.

Would you come to the FOSS4G in Bucharest?
