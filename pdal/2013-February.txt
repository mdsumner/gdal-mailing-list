Subject: [pdal] PointBuffer.getData format
Message-ID: <8D7840B3-2AD9-4767-857A-0431C62CF52E@opengeo.org>

Hi,

Just curious what exactly is in the raw byte data accessible with myPointBuffer.getData(0)? Postgres pointcloud's basic validation is not complaining if I insert a hex-encoded version of this, but the values all seem a bit off when I query the resulting db table.

Alternatively, is there a better way to grab what I need from a PointBuffer and re-pack it into a hex-encoded binary myself?

Thanks,

Michael

It should be the front of the array, offset to the given index when the index is given as a point number.

There is no method for just setting the data for a PointBuffer yourself, and I don't see any reason why there can't be. Feel free to cook a pull request that copies in your data into the scoped_array of PointBuffer. We could make the m_data element something better, though at one time we wanted PointBuffer to be copy-constructable, which mean shying away from a heap-allocated, shared_ptr-managed entity. Maybe we can go back to this.

PointBuffer::getData(0) should be the front of the array as dumb bytes.

Hi Folks,
My cmake-fu is still in it's infancy ( using cmake-gui) .  I'm still
getting the Cairo-dir not found when trying to configure. Using the zip
file pulled down this morning with the FindCairo.cmake module embedded.

 whereis cairo.h -  gives:
cairo: /usr/include/cairo

using the standard system cairo2-dev package
cairo (1.10.2-6.1ubuntu3)

Doug,

Sorry. The Cairo CMake module I just added isn't very smart, and I can report it is breaking for me locally too.  I'll to to push a fix in the next few hours, and I'll email you when a new one is available.

Alternatively, you could remove/comment out the find_package(Cairo) line from apps/pshape/CMakeLists.txt to work around things.

Howard

Do I need to update cairo beyond the system default for Ubuntu 12.04?

Doug,

I have pushed some changes that should take care of the cairo detection issues.

As for this geotiff one, I think the issue was not having a new enough libtiff, libgeotiff, and GDAL.  All three of these libraries unfortunately ship slightly different cpl_serv.h files, and there's a bunch of unfortunate #ifdef magic to pick the correct ones depending on the situation.

A new enough GDAL should be 1.9.x, because I'm using that in other situations and things link/compile ok.

An incompatible libtiff might be the one that's causing the conflict.

Catch me on IRC for interactive debugging if you're still stuck.

Howard
