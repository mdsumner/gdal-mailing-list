Michael,

Glad to hear you had a successful talk.

Happy to add Azavea <https://www.azavea.com/> to the list of people who
like PDAL.

We recently used PDAL in conjunction with GeoTrellis
<https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis> to convert LAZ to DEM for
doing volumetric change calculations in Apache Spark. (point cloud demo repo
<https://github.com/geotrellis/geotrellis-pointcloud-demo>) Part of this
work actually lead us to making a contribution of PDAL JNI bindings to the
main library.

We have used and plan to use PDAL for professional services work that
involves point clouds.

Good luck on the submission! Keep us posted.

Hi Michael

Feel free to mention the national mapping authority of Denmark, The Agency for Data Supply and Efficiency (sdfe.dk – only in Danish at the moment). We use PDAL in our production of the Danish Elevation Model, which is a nation-wide point cloud dataset that consist of roughly 415 billion classified and colored points supplied in LAS format. Howard and his people has very kindly set up a potree demo of the dataset. You can find it here: http://potree.entwine.io/data/denmark.html
In the production line PDAL is used for adding RGB-values to point cloud files and for vertical datum shifts (ellipsoidal heights to orthometric heights). An added benefit of using PDAL  for the vertical datum shift is that given the right input, PDAL will write a proper WKT spatial reference in the header of the LAS files. We also use PDAL for general data management and all sorts of ad hoc tasks.

GRASS GIS project is working on integrating PDAL. (Currently stalled, but
should get better soon.)

This is great to hear.  I've tried a couple of times to get a feel for what
sort of things we could do with Lidar in GRASS.  Could never really get a
feel for it.

Message-ID: <CAAhorQ=t16A5kbeWj+u_VBUq2pTzU8wLAz9-kk92+=iLcK28VA@mail.gmail.com>

Can we use the Python Bindings to create a LAS file from values we hold in
Memory?  In my case, I'm using the HDF Python library to read a .h5 file
and need to convert the results to LAS.

In the Writing with PDAL documentation
<https://www.pdal.io/tutorial/writing.html#writing>, Bradley Chambers shows
how to do this in C++ ... but it looks like we're missing some machinery to
do it via Python.

In the test for the Python Bindings
<https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/blob/master/python/test/test_pipeline.py>, we
see how to write the output from a filter to an array ... but not the other
way around.

Hi Michael

might LASpy help?

http://laspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tut_part_1.html

I also need to cross this bridge sometime really soon - and I’m also interested in a PDAL answer, if one exists.

Regards

Adam

Not at this time, but it's been on my queue for Python stuff. I filed a ticket at https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1573 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/issues/1573> on the topic.

Part of the reason it isn't done yet is I haven't been sure how it would work. There's a few challenges

- We aren't going to do IPC, so the only way it could be used is in Python extension scenarios https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdal <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pdal> . 
- PDAL has explicitly named dimensions https://www.pdal.io/dimensions.html <https://www.pdal.io/dimensions.html> and Numpy has array names. The user is going to have to map their arrays to known PDAL names or things will be quite mushy, especially when translating to other formats.
- Unsure what to do about multiple arrays at once, but I presume we'll just disallow it for starters
- Metadata, SRS, and  construction and assignment 

None of this is too difficult, but there's still a significant effort required to complete it.

Thanks for the explanation. One  alternative might be to add an HDF reader
/ writer.   Thoughts on the feasibility of this?  Thoughts on using the
official HDF library vs leveraging the implementation in GDAL (which I
assume is different) ?

The readers.icebridge driver is already using HDF5. The problem is every HDF5 file is potentially a different layout/schema, and coming up with a way to define those things might be tough.

I've wondered if it would be too onerous to supply a mapping document for generic HDF5/NetCDF4 io - for example:

pdal translate in.hdf5 out.laz —hdf5-dimension-to-pdal-dimension-map=‘hdf5map.json’

pdal translate in.laz out.hdf5 —hdf5-dimension-to-pdal-dimension-map=‘hdf5map.json’

since netCDF4 is a specific way of writing a HDF5 file, using an appropriate map-of-dimensions and naming the result ‘out.nc’ might work.

would it need to tackle internal chunking? maybe. And likley more things I have not considered.

OpenDroneMap <3 PDAL for sure. v0.3 (pending) will even calc DTMs using PDAL.

Subject: [pdal] filters.programmable in Docker
Message-ID: <05affbf6-6095-f831-e536-3c6fec1ecc64@mail.uio.no>

Hello

I am trying to use filters.programmable in Docker pdal/pdal:1.5, but I 
am encountering a problem.

pdal exits with the following message:
ImportError: numpy.core.multiarray failed to import
PDAL: ImportError('numpy.core.multiarray failed to import',)

It seems that numpy is not a part of the Docker image but I found numpy 
in pdal/dependencies:1.5.

Is there a easy way to use filters.programmable in the Docker image?

Thank you for PDAL!
Niels

Michael,
Here is a basic intro.  I'll probably be expanding it a bit in the near
future.

Confirmed. I pushed a fix that will refresh the pdal/pdal:1.5 container to not purge the python-numpy package as part of the docker diet section of the Dockerfile. Expect the new container in an hour or so when DockerHub gets done building it.

Thanks!

Howard

Thank you for the quick fix!

Now numpy works in the pdal:1.5 container, but I am still getting the 
same error in filters.programmable.

To me it seems to be the same issue as #1174:

Niels,

I pushed another fix that should get you over this issue. The DockerHub containers are refreshing at the moment and should be ready ~1 hour.

Thanks for the reports!
