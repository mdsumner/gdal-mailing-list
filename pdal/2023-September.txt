Just a reminder that the OSGeo Community Sprint is shaping up for a few months from now and the point cloud community is starting to look well represented. We could always use more, however. Please consider participating. We look forward to eating some schnitzel with you!

Many sponsors from the point cloud processing community sponsored the event, and that sponsorship is now finally being used.

During the 2015 sprint in Philadelphia, Markus Sch?tz worked with us on what evolved into EPT and then eventually into COPC. During 2016, I refactored the management and deployment of the proj.org website, which with the community's continued effort, evolved into a 900+ page compendium rivaling Synder [2]. During 2019 in Minneapolis, we worked with RIEGL to solidify the RXP/RDB readers in PDAL and refactored the gdal.org website to follow PROJ's model.

Instead, a code sprint is where high bandwidth communication, camaraderie, and collaboration can happen. Code sprints help projects satisfy their niche, strategize interoperability challenges, and share techniques. If your organization depends upon PDAL and friends to achieve its technology, consider sending someone to help us continue to evolve the technology. This might be something like the new PDAL Wrench [3] capability from Lutra Consulting that powers QGIS' new point cloud processing toolbox. Or maybe it is something else you want to add like the recent PRs from Altametris to add straightening and georeferencing filters (thanks Guilhem!).
