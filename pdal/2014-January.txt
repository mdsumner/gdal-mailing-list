Hi folks,
In

"The XML pipeline file referenced the external `multiply_z.pl` `Python`_
script,",

I'm guessing it should be

"The XML pipeline file referenced the external `multiply_z.py` `Python`_
script,"

Brad,

I saw on IRC that you were asking about CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY being set to PROJECT_BINARY_DIR/bin. Mateusz may have some CMake history to know what we should really be doing on for these variables. I do know that it is convenient on *nix to keep the .libs and apps in the /bin dir for running tests and such without having to manually set paths. I'd like to keep that capability if possible in whatever we do.

Thank you for doing the windows cleanups. Please feel free to merge in any and all of your pull requests that touch up all these issues.

Howard

AFAIR, all those settings of _OUTPUT_DIRECTORY was used to simplify
run-time linking for running tests from build directories.
This used to be a common technique used by CMake users in the past.

AFAIK, currently CMake folks suggest to make rely on install() command:
- on Windows, run local installation somewhere inside build tree, then
obviously all .exe and .dll will be collected in one place [1]
- on *nix, make use of rpath: CMake sets it for build locations, and
updates it during install with installation locations

It looks PDAL (and libLAS too) may need some love in this area.

Long time ago, I asked [2] about some best practices for output paths,
I may repeat my question and see what's the recommendation now.

Paul Ramsey did all the Postgres work. I have done some work recently to speed up the Postgresql stuff with some surprising results. I hope to cook up an email to the list or update the pg docs for posterity in the future on that item once I'm done.

I have joined the list and when more questions come up about PDAL, I'd be happy to join in. I must admit that PDAL is intended to be useful for GUI developers, but only in the sense of a data access/translation and light duty processing library. In practice, it is very possible there are sticky points for people looking to use PDAL inside of GUI apps due to the fact that most of my development is focused on processing/translation pipelines rather than feeding data to a window. That said, I hope it to be useful for those tasks, and as more people jump in and start using PDAL, I expect that aspect of it to get beefier.

I read on the lists logs about some questions about libLAS, LASlib, and PDAL. I hope to clarify some of that murkiness. PDAL is the successor to libLAS, which itself was a reaction to LASlib not being available under an open source license at the time. libLAS is essentially a maintenance-only library at this time, and PDAL contains nearly all the functionality that libLAS had, except for the ability to manipulate LAS data with Python. That feature's now covered much better by http://www.laspy.org.  PDAL is very much intended to be like GDAL except in the point cloud format domain. LASlib is now straight LGPL and has a fantastic toolbox of functionality that is poorly integrated into existing systems. It also has no release mechanism, github repository, or other open source accouterments.  PDAL aims to stay out of LASlib's niche to provide data access and format translation as its primary capability.

> 
> Currently, Hexer and Nitro do not have any tagged releases. This presents a roadblock for submitting their formulae upstream to the main Homebrew repository (aka a 'tap'), since one of the 'acceptable formula' criteria is that the formula not be HEAD-only. From the CMakeLists.txt for Hexer I see it is set to a 1.0.1 version, while Nitro appears to be at 2.7 (?). 

PDAL is *very* close to a 1.0.0 release. I have a few more items that I want to clean up before I release 1.0.0 and signal that I'm interested in folks coming along for real and kicking the tires. I appreciate the PDAL homebrew update. I had been meaning to do that but have't had time yet.

I'll create a hexer 1.0.1 tag today and make sure that the CMake configuration is up to date with it.

Nitro is not something that is generally needed. Nitro is for reading NITF files, and there is a DoD lidar format that stores LAS files inside of NITF containers (it is as awful as you think it would be). The PDAL Nitro configuration is for that specific format. I don't know how generally useful it would be. The Nitro fork that I maintain is due to the fact that the maintainer wasn't interested in either collaborating on github or in cmake configuration for the library. I do not wish to materially fork the library in any way except to make the integration easier with my own CMake-based metabuild system.

I'll be happy to answer a question on that via the qgis list.
