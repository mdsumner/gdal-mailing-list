PDAL is open source software and we have merged many pull requests from individuals who have provided useful and specific capabilities for their processing pipelines. We would be interested in merging something that applied alternative voxelization approaches, though I must point out that if you're willing to use Python we have developed an open source tool for doing that task called SilviMetric. You can find it at silvimetric.com <http://silvimetric.com/>.

I looked at silvimetric but couldn't find anything related to voxels. Which
command has that function?

Does anyone have experience with using silvimetric (another Howard Butler
package)? I have been told that it could solve a voxelization problem I
have, but the website doesn't provide any details on that application.

Subject: [pdal] pipeline with EPT
Message-ID: <CADm=QrT4HRtpYrB4j8LTH2Po+En_EP+=BbdUPF-nQLuBFTgx3g@mail.gmail.com>

I'm trying to run a pipeline with EPT as the input and I'm seeing it use a
lot of memory. Am I doing something wrong here?
pipeline:
[
{
"type": "readers.ept",
"filename": "
https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/usgs-lidar-public/SC_SavannahPeeDee_7_2019/ept.json
",
"tag": "input_SC_SavannahPeeDee_7_2019",
"bounds": "([2300253.0, 2316273.0], [366099.0, 382119.0])/EPSG:2273"
},
{
"filename": "point_peedee7.las",
"type": "writers.las",
"forward": "all",
"minor_version":4
}
]

It pulls about 400 million points and uses over 20G of RAM while doing it
(based on watching top). That's in the ballpark of reading all the points
into memory. Is there something different I should be doing? Did I miss an
option? Running PDAL version 2.6.3.

Thank you very much for the answers:

In previous versions of pdal, the result of the vertical datum change was
an output.las file with a new height system, still with the legend "Warning
1: +init=epsg:XXXX syntax is deprecated. It might return a CRS with a
non-EPSG compliant axis order."

But currently I have not been able to achieve it, I am using pdal version
2.6.3. And the output.las file does not reflect the vertical datum change.

I did several pipeline tests, for example:

[
     "./input_WGS84_UTM14N.las",
     {
         "type":"filters.reprojection",
         "in_srs":"EPSG:32614",
         "out_srs":"+proj=utm +zone=14 +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84 +units=m
+no_defs +geoidgrids=C:/clouds/geoids/GGM10_GEO.gtx"
     },
     {
         "type":"writers.las",
          "a_srs":"EPSG:32614+5703",
         "filename":"./output_WGS84_UTM14N_GGM2010.las"
     }
]

and there is no vertical datum change in the output.

Later I tried to use the filters.projpipeline filter, but I don't know how
to tell it "change vertical datum using the geogrid.gtx achvio"

I used this pipeline:
[
     "./input_WGS84_UTM14N.las",
     {
         "type":"filters.projpipeline",
         "coord_op":"+proj=pipeline +step +proj=vgridshift
+grids=C:/clouds/geoids/GGM10_GEO.gtx",
         "out_srs":"EPSG:32614+5703"
     },
     {
         "type":"writers.las",
         "a_srs":"EPSG:32614+5703",
         "filename":"./output_WGS84_UTM14N_GGM2010.las"
     }
]

and I got this:

(pdal pipeline filters.projpipeline Error) GDAL failure (1) PROJ:
vgridshift: Invalid latitude


Could you guys give me a clue what I'm doing wrong?

Cordially

All,

I am pleased to announce the release of PDAL 2.7.0. Along with the normal bug fixes and features, it adds a number of very useful abilities: 

* unary math functions in filters.expression and filters.assign
* filters.h3 for H3 index generation
* readers.las is now threaded (effect best seen when reading LAZ)
* random filename support (put #uuid# in your filename to inject some randomness in your life)

See https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/2.7.0 for more details. Builds via Conda should be forthcoming over the weekend.

Howard

Well, after reading and asking and your response to Howard and Jim and that
of Even from PROJ, it seems that I have achieved it, thank you.
It would still be necessary to take into account Jim Klassen's
considerations about what he says in point 6), but at least the change in
heights is now concrete:

[
    "./input_WGS84_UTM14N.las",
    {
        "type":"filters.projpipeline",
        "coord_op":"+proj=pipeline +step +inv +proj=utm +zone=11
+ellps=WGS84 +step +proj=vgridshift +grids=/nubes/geoides/GGM10_GEO.gtx
+step +proj=utm +zone=11 +ellps=WGS84"
    },
    {
        "type":"writers.las",
        "scale_x":"0.001",
        "scale_y":"0.001",
        "scale_z":"0.001",
        "offset_x":"570000",
        "offset_y":"3590000",
        "offset_z":"0",
        "global_encoding":1,
        "a_srs":"EPSG:32611+5703",
        "filename":"./output_WGS84_UTM14N_GGM2010.las"
    }
]
