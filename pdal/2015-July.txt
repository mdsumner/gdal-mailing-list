Hi List,

I am experimenting with the following pdal translate command:

pdal translate --writers.las.minor_version="4" --writers.las.format="6" --a_srs "EPSG:2903" --input pc16351450.las --output pc16351450_pdrf6_wkt.las

The input las contains only two classifications (1 & 2), however, on output the result has significant changes to point classification; is there a flag that I'm missing to maintain the classification through translation.

Thanks for any guidance.

Best regards,

Rob

There has been no intentional change.  If you could submit a bug report
with the command you're using (what you've shown above) and a small example
input file, that would be appreciated.

Hi Andrew,

Appreciate your message.  The input point cloud was processed with FME to 1.4 PDRF=1.  I realized the classification had changed in a couple of ways; first with pdal info I noticed that the Classification min max (1, 2) changed to (0, 255) and in FME Data Inspector when I queried the points; they were all over the range.  Yeah, I?m not exactly sure how to change the classification byte offset in pdal translate (i.e. via --writers.las.Classification.Offset=) or if I should be using pdal pipeline.  Also, when I set the PDRF=6, and view the data in FME Data Inspector it seems to modify the point cloud projection (scaling and/or offsets) since FME Data Inspector doesn?t interpret the point cloud as a contiguous block of point data even though I can still query the points.

Thanks again and I?ll provide the small input test las file.

Rob

Trying to convert some las to pcd for use with PCL. "pdal translate foo.las foo.pcd" yields:
"PDAL: Unable to fetch data and convert as requested: Red:uint16_t(27136) -> unsigned char"

I'm guessing there's some 16-bit data points and PCL can only work on 8-bit? Can I create a filter to compress this down to 8-bit?

Yes.  You just need to make sure that your values for RGB will fit into an
unsigned char (since that's what's supported on PCL).  Let's say you want
to scale data from uint16_t to uint8_t (unsigned char).  A very simple
filter would essentially look like:

// Not compiled or tested...
void filter(PointView& view)
{
    for (PointId idx = 0; idx < view.size(); ++idx)
    {
        uint16_t r = view.getFieldAs<uint16_t>(Dimension::Id::Red, idx);
        view.setField(Dimension::Id::Red, idx, (r >> 8));
        // Repeat for Green and Blue.
    }
}

You can make a pipeline with your filter that has a LAS reader, your filter
and a PCD writer.  Of course, you can do fancier things than this example.

As an alternative, you can write python and use the programmable filter (
http://www.pdal.io/stages/filters.programmable.html).

Write back if you have more questions.

Hello,

In attempting to install the latest PDAL development version with homebrew, and I run into what appears to be some cmake configuration issues in that   I get a message about:


* RiVLib plugin , read data in the RXP format

* Python plugin , add features that depend on python


Just prior to the error message:  -- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!
Wondering if there might be a work around for this situation?

Once again thank you for any guidance.

Both of these should be completely optional.  It might be that the homebrew recipe needs some updating. I will take a look and get back to you.

I have looked into it, and there?s currently two PDAL Homebrew recipes ? the mainline one which is very old (and should be removed ? I will make a request to do so), and the OSGeo4Mac one that is newer and provides the expected ecosystem of supporting libraries. I have made a pull request of the OSGeo4Mac one that enables the following drivers:

https://gist.github.com/hobu/32f29954c57239205530

Hopefully it will be merged soon. In the interim, you can use https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac/pull/98 as a guide.

Hope this helps,

Howard

Subject: [pdal] Dutch AHN2 point cloud free and open web visualization
Message-ID: <55B78B68.7000100@esciencecenter.nl>

Dear all,

As part of the "Massive Point Clouds for eSciences" 
(http://pointclouds.nl/) project we have combined the forces of potree, 
PDAL, LAStools and some new tools to create a free and open 3D point 
cloud visualization of all the Netherlands in the web.

http://ahn2.pointclouds.nl/

- It currently works in Firefox and Chrome in all the OSs but in order 
to enjoy the navigation it is recommended to use a system with decent 
graphics performance (if that is not the case, use the settings to 
decrease the number of points)
- It still runs in our testing server so be gentle with it ;)

In addition to the 3D point cloud visualization (based on potree) it 
also has a download tool (using LAStools) so you can download your 
favourite part of the country! Also a 2D map where the field of view is 
depicted, a customizable colour range, a search bar and measurement tools.

All the new code is free open source and available in github:

- https://github.com/NLeSC/Massive-PotreeConverter
- https://github.com/NLeSC/ahn-pointcloud-viewer
- https://github.com/NLeSC/ahn-pointcloud-viewer-ws

Search for your home (only if you live in the NL! ;) )

Kind Regards,

Oscar, Stefan and Maarten @ the Netherlands eScience Center
"Massive Point Cloud for eScience" project partners are: TU Delft, 
Netherlands eScience Center, Oracle, Fugro, Rijkwaterstaat, CWI
Also many thanks to Markus Sch?tz (potree)!
