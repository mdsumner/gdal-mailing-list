Subject: [pdal] boundary json coordinate order for geographic
Message-ID: <CADm=QrSCPiMbpLq_2PyFhgrv=KAv_dtUnXGQrEevAnhs2M1SbA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I've been using pdal info --boundary to generate bounds for datasets. I
take the boundary_json element and feed it to ogr2ogr to use for clipping.
That has worked well. However, if the data is in geographic, the
coordinates get flipped. Instead of xy, the entries are lat lon. For
example (in Florida):

{"type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [[[[26.0972695, -80.41166909], ...

That seems like it would match with the GDAL expectation since GDAL 3
honors by default authority (EPSG) axis order, so that means lat/lon for
geographic CRS. But I think it conflicts with GeoJSON in the spec section
3.1.1 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.1>. In any
case, when I convert that JSON of the bounds with something like:

ogr2ogr -a_srs EPSG:4759 bounds.gpkg bounds.json

I'll get the order flipped and it will be south of Africa instead of in
Florida. If I flip all the coordinates in the json and then run it through
ogr2ogr, it lands in the right place. Is this a PDAL issue or am I just
doing something wrong?

A small update. It seems like this behavior is not consistent. The very
large (10Gb) laz file that surfaced this problem has json output where the
order of coordinates is different in the "boundary" element compared to the
"boundary_json" element. Here are the last few of the boundary coordinates
and the first few of the boundary_json coordinates from the same output:

-80.089349 26.156294,-80.089265 26.156342,-80.089265 26.156439,-80.089349
26.156391,-80.089418 26.156415,-80.089376 26.156342,-80.089432
26.156294,-80.089432 26.156198,-80.089376 26.15615,-80.089432
26.156053,-80.089502 26.156077,-80.089557 26.156029,-80.089502
26.155981,-80.089557 26.155884,-80.089502 26.155836,-80.089557
26.15574,-80.089516 26.155716)))",
    "boundary_json": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [
26.097269499999999, -80.411669090000004 ], [ 26.097269499999999,

-80.410165649999996 ]

>From a different laz file of the same general area and in the same
coordinate system, but much smaller at around 90 Mb the pdal info
--boundary output looks like this:

(-80.93805 26.603566,-80.938917 26.605068,-80.938917 26.602064,-80.936605

26.603566),(-80.947588 26.604067,-80.947588 26.602064,-80.943542
26.602064,-80.942386 26.603066,-80.943542 26.605068,-80.945854
26.605068,-80.947588 26.604067)))",
    "boundary_json": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [
-80.987766449999995, 26.554502500000002 ], [ -80.98603215,
26.554502500000002 ], [ -80.984875950000003, 26.5555038 ], [
-80.983141649999993, 26.554502500000002 ], [ -80.980829249999999,
26.554502500000002 ], [ -80.979673050000002, 26.5555038 ], [
-80.977938739999999, 26.554502500000002 ],

You can see that the coordinates are in the same order in the boundary and
boundary_json elements and everything works as expected. I've put the big
file on ftp if you want to test, but it is painfully large.

finally point cloud data for an old project has been published. Was the
origin of pdaltools plugin when pdal was not yet integrated in qgis.

data can be streamed via EPT:
https://cartolab.udc.es/geomove/datos/en/pcls
https://cartolab.udc.es/geomove/datos/en/

I hope to have time to move them to a more reliable platform such as
opentopography. feel free to mirror them.

Subject: [pdal] Using PDAL for the first time

Message-ID: <410173491.3841983.1645881030056@mail.yahoo.com>

Hello.
I don't know if this is the right place to ask this query. The thing is that I am using PDAL for the first time in the context of an application written in C++. I am trying to create a pipeline with two stages: a reader that reads a LAS and a Chipper filter that splits it into chunks. The code (summarized) is as follows:
? ? ? ? pdal::PipelineManager pipeline.
? ? ? ? pipeline.makeReader(
? ? ? ? ? ? src, // const std::string& inputFile,? ? ? ? ? ? std::string());
? ? ? ? pipeline->makeFilter("filters.chipper");
? ? ? ? pipeline->execute();

As I understand it, after execute() pipeline-views() should return a set of PointViews, each of which should have about 5000 points. Unfortunately, pipeline-views().size() returns one, a single PointView with about 400,000 points. What am I doing wrong?

Thanks in advance!

? ? ? ? ? ? // partirlo en trozos? ? ? ? ? ? pdal::ChipperFilter chipper; // default: 5000 puntos? ? ? ? ? ? chipper.prepare(table);? ? ? ? ? ? pdal::PointViewSet views = chipper.execute(table);
