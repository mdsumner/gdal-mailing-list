Subject: [pdal] Accessing point data directly
Message-ID: <5a2554e1.b198df0a.958c3.b6a3@mx.google.com>

Hi all,

I am writing a C++ program that makes use of PDAL. I would like to be able to read in a file (for example a .las file) and then access the data for the points directly. For example I’d like to know the X, Y, and Z values for the first point. How would be the best way of doing this? I’ve been looking through the API but I’m not entirely sure what I’m looking for. I’ve managed to use the readers, writers, and filters, but I’m struggling to work out how to access the data. If someone could give me a point in the right direction that would be great!

Thanks,
Stephen

1) If you're doing processing as in a PDAL pipeline, you can just write a
stage that does the processing you wish.  Take a look at:

https://www.pdal.io/development/writing-filter.html

If all you want to do is read the data, you can just implement run() or
filter().


2) If you want to read all the points into memory and then access the data
you can do something like:

main()
{
  PointTable t;

  LasReader r;
  Options o;
  o.add("filename", "somefile.las");
  r.setOptions(o);

  r.prepare(t);
  PointViewSet s = r.execute(t);
  PointViewPtr v = *s.begin();  // Assumes one PointView

  for (PointId id = 0; i < v.size(); ++i)
  {
    double x = v->getFieldAs<double>(Dimension::Id::X, i);
    double y = v->getFieldAs<double>(Dimension::Id::Y, i);
    double z = v->getFieldAs<double>(Dimension::Id::Z, i);
}

If you have the source or are looking at it on Github, there are lots of
examples of how you might access data in the test/unit directory.

Hope that helps,

Subject: [pdal] Linking with PCL
Message-ID: <5a339963.82a4500a.41feb.3f91@mx.google.com>

Hi,

I am trying to use the voxelgrid filter in some c++ code I am writing (and would also like to be able to read and write .pcd files). I believe I have linked in PCL correctly, and my solution builds the plugin .dll files. However, although there is plenty of information on the PDAL website about using PCL in pipelines, I have not managed to find anything to help me use the API. I currently have a function I am playing around with to try and get the filter to work:

bool ReadFilterWrite(const std::string& inputfilename, const std::string& readerdriver, const std::string& outputfilename)
{
  	bool bFilterWorks=false;
 	pdal::StageFactory factory;
  	pdal::PointTable table;
  	pdal::Stage *pReader = factory.createStage(readerdriver);
  	pdal::Options readerOptions;
  	readerOptions.add("filename", inputfilename);
  	if (pReader)
  	{
  		pReader->setOptions(readerOptions);
  	}
  	else
  	{
    		return false;
  	}
  	pdal::Options writerOptions;
  	writerOptions.add("filename", outputfilename);
  	pdal::Stage *pWriter = factory.createStage("writers.text");
  	if (pWriter)
  	{
  		pdal::Stage *pFilter = factory.createStage("filters.voxelgrid");
    		if (pFilter)
    		{
    			bFilterWorks = true;
  			pFilter->setInput(*pReader);
    			pWriter->setInput(*pFilter);
    		}
    		else
    		{
     			//Currently commented out so that files are only written if the filter works.
    			//pWriter->setInput(*pReader);
    			return false; //Temporary, currently where the function exits.
    		}
   		pWriter->setOptions(writerOptions);
    		pWriter->prepare(table);
    		pWriter->execute(table);
  	}
  	return bFilterWorks;
}

The function reads the data in from a .las file (for example) fine, but then doesn’t create the filter stage. Am I going about this in the right way?

Best regards,

Stephen

When I run pdal –drivers in the command prompt it does list the filter as being found. My configuration script sets PCL to build and libpdal_plugin_filter_voxelgrid.dll has been created in the bin folder.

Stephen,

If I understand, you're building your own executable using the code that
you referenced.  The executable you created must be able to find the PCL
plugin in one of these directories: “.”, “./lib”, “../lib”, “./bin”,
“../bin” relative to your executable path.  You can also explicitly set
PDAL_DRIVER_PATH to the location of the driver.

Hi Andrew,

You’re totally right, I had put the .dll in the same folder as the executable rather than in one of the specified locations.

Many thanks for your help,
Stephen

Stephen,

If I understand, you're building your own executable using the code that you referenced.  The executable you created must be able to find the PCL plugin in one of these directories: “.”, “./lib”, “../lib”, “./bin”, “../bin” relative to your executable path.  You can also explicitly set PDAL_DRIVER_PATH to the location of the driver.

The StageFactory must be able to locate the plugin.  See the second question in the FAQ: https://www.pdal.io/faq.html

Hi,
 
I am trying to use the voxelgrid filter in some c++ code I am writing (and would also like to be able to read and write .pcd files). I believe I have linked in PCL correctly, and my solution builds the plugin .dll files. However, although there is plenty of information on the PDAL website about using PCL in pipelines, I have not managed to find anything to help me use the API. I currently have a function I am playing around with to try and get the filter to work:
 
bool ReadFilterWrite(const std::string& inputfilename, const std::string& readerdriver, const std::string& outputfilename)
{
                bool bFilterWorks=false;
               pdal::StageFactory factory;
                pdal::PointTable table;
                pdal::Stage *pReader = factory.createStage(readerdriver);
                pdal::Options readerOptions;
                readerOptions.add("filename", inputfilename);
                if (pReader)
                {
                                pReader->setOptions(readerOptions);
                }
                else
                {
                                return false;
                }
                pdal::Options writerOptions;
                writerOptions.add("filename", outputfilename);
                pdal::Stage *pWriter = factory.createStage("writers.text");
                if (pWriter)
                {
                                pdal::Stage *pFilter = factory.createStage("filters.voxelgrid");
                                if (pFilter)
                                {
                                                bFilterWorks = true;
                                                pFilter->setInput(*pReader);
                                                pWriter->setInput(*pFilter);
                                }
                                else
                                {
                                               //Currently commented out so that files are only written if the filter works.
                                                //pWriter->setInput(*pReader);
                                                return false; //Temporary, currently where the function exits.
                                }
                                pWriter->setOptions(writerOptions);
                                pWriter->prepare(table);
                                pWriter->execute(table);
                }
                return bFilterWorks;
}
 
The function reads the data in from a .las file (for example) fine, but then doesn’t create the filter stage. Am I going about this in the right way?
 
Best regards,
 
Stephen

Hi list,

Before starting to add a Potree writer/reader I wanted to ask, if someone
has already worked on this. I looked around but couldn't find anything.

Best regards,

Is there a compelling reason to not use the Greyhound + Entwine combination?

Yes. Less software to install is the main reason.

Hi Daniel, all

PotreeConverter exists - and is dockerised - and while not super stable it
does the job :)

I had an off-list discussion with Connor a while ago about reading entwine
directly using the potree viewer - without greyhound, purely for removing
one extra http interface when looking at points; and using the greyhound
API when we want to do stuff with points.

However, looking more deeply, it might just be a matter of figuring out how
to configure my entwine build to write smaller chunks, ie topping out at  a
few thousand or few hundred thousand points (happy to take assistance, I
was just minutes from posting an issue on entwine and/or e-mailing ) - at
the expense of more files… which is a neat segue to...

Potreeconverter writes out very many more, much smaller files than entwine;
and writing out potrees is really bloaty - a 240ish GB entwine dataset
turned out to be 700+GB of potree (as LASzip)!!! So this was smaller than
the original LAS data by a few hundred GB, bout astoundingly larger than
the LAZ’ed data and its entwine writeout.

No religious opinion about whether writers.potree should exist or not, but
thought I’d share some notes

Cheers, hope that helps!

Adam

Thank you, Adam, for sharing this information!

My use case is not so much about handling very large point cloud datasets.
And it's not supposed to run on a server, so as less dependencies as
possible is preferred.
The Potree format, that PotreeConverter creates, does very well the job it
should do. And it is very simple to serve.

I want to have an alternative for the PotreeConverter, and I think it won't
be useless to have an additional writer/reader for PDAL.
I know, that there are some efforts in reducing the number of files, that
PotreeConverter creates. So hopefully this disadvantage will go away.

Cheers,
Daniel
