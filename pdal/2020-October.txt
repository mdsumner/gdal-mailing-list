Subject: [pdal] NAD83 ellipsoid heights in entwine
Message-ID: <CADm=QrQUTsrGhyFYZTyXrg39CCaaDuEKMuX5Yece9stA6wOTuA@mail.gmail.com>

This may also relate to a recent question on "Unknown" values in WKT
strings. I'm trying to create EPT files where my horizontal coordinates are
in NAD83 UTM and my vertical are ellipsoid heights. There isn't a lot of
information that I could find about how to set up the reference system for
something like that. The recommendations in the OGC GeoTIFF documentation
<http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/19-008r4/19-008r4.html#section-D-3> suggest
you could do something like putting the projected 2D CRS in the horizontal
and the code/description for the geographic 3D reference system in the
vertical. There is no EPSG code for NAD83 ellipsoid heights except as part
of a 3D reference system.

Do you have any idea how I can specify those coordinates such that entwine
or pdal will understand it? They currently do not recognize the 3D CRS code
(e.g. 6319 for NAD83(2011) ellipsoid) as a legitimate vertical choice. Is
there a WKT for this that just isn't well known to me? I think it isn't
only NAD83 that has this issue. I have checked in with EPSG on this before.
The response didn't get me very far, but I'll put it here in case it helps
someone else.

In the ISO data model (which EPSG follows) ellipsoidal height has been
defined as the vertical component of a 3D geographic coordinate reference
system. An ellipsoidal height definitely cannot exist on its own as a 1D
vertical CRS, and therefore cannot be part of a compound 2D + 1D CRS..

However there has been some recent discussion regarding whether the concept
of a 3D projected CRS (easting northing with ellipsoidal height) is valid.
Superficially it sounds possible. But there are some in the geodetic parts
of NOAA and other national mapping agencies that are doubtful as to whether
the concept is valid. There are sound technical arguments for why the
concept may be invalid. These revolve around the map projection process
being tangential to the ellipsoid surface and not on it.

We in the IOGP geodesy subcommittee are seeking evidence of an appropriate
implementation. We have yet to have explained a valid case. Most of the
evidence we have collected so far turns out to be imagery being draped over
a TIN and it then transpires that the heights in the TIN are
gravity-related, not ellipsoidal. These are not academic questions, for if
a projected 3D CRS construct were to be possible, we can envisage a number
of ways in which the components could be created. For spatial data
management there are plusses and minuses in each of these. We wish to fully
understand the pros and cons before we contemplate populating what, if we
got it wrong, could turn out to be inappropriate records in the EPSG
Dataset.


While it seems like the EPSG answer says my reference system isn't valid,
I'm not convinced. Lidar collections are going to start in the 3D
coordinate system (lat, lon, ellipsoid heights). If they then have a geoid
applied to get to orthometric prior to projecting, that seems to be
considered valid (e.g. NAD83 UTM + NAVD88), but if you don't apply the
geoid, it's invalid. That makes no sense.

Hello,

I was wondering if someone has a PDAL pipeline for extracting building footprints from a LAS file.

Thanks,
Mehran

Subject: [pdal] Generic read/write based on file suffix?
Message-ID: <B90982B9-39A7-428F-8F37-BEDE9A3977C2@slu.se>

Hi!

Is there a way to write pipes without specifying the reader/writer?
That is, can I write mypipe.json in such a way so that something like the following would work?
pdal pipeline mypipe.json —input=in/file.laz --output=out/file.laz
The idea is that the suffix .laz of in/file.laz would determine the reader to be readers.las. And similar with the output. That way
pdal pipeline mypipe.json —input=in/file.pcd --output=out/file.text
would work without modifying mypipe.json.

I see that all readers and writers specify the file suffices that they handle, so the information needed to automatically determine the reader/writer seems to be there.

Any suggestions are appreciated.

Best regards,

Sure. Just use `pdal translate` with the `--json` option.

Kirk,

I reached out to Even and he asked the GeoTIFF group. The discussion on the topic you might participate in is at https://github.com/opengeospatial/geotiff/issues/82 <https://github.com/opengeospatial/geotiff/issues/82>
