All,

We have released version 2.4.1. It is a minor bug-fix release that is ABI
compatible with version 2.4.0. This release is of interest to those writing
COPC with PDAL or experiencing issues with non-ASCII filenames on Windows.

https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/releases/tag/2.4.1

Please write with questions.
