Hi,

I have multiple numbers of PCD files in my folder.  If I use the pdal
translate file.pcd file.csv, I need to run this command for every single
time when I want to convert a pcd file.But I need to create individual csv
file for every single pcd file using a single command line. Is it possible
to perform this action via PDAL? If so, any help will be very appreciated

Thank you very much for your valuable time. I will wait for your kind
feedback.

Single command line?  Why not just loop through the files? In bash:

for (file in *.pcd)
do
  pdal translate $file ${file##*.}csv
done

See filters.range.

You could really benefit by spending some time reading the documentation.

Hi,

Is it possible to run the awk and pcd translate command in the same loop in
bash ?

I am trying to remove the rows where my first column contains a value of
zero and they converting those files into csv file with the following

You need to choose if you are doing the filtering external or internal to
pdal.

You could use awk to filter the points, but you would need to have awk read
the original file and write a temporary file for pdal to read.  You need to
be careful that this modified temporary file is still valid according to
the pcd file format.  I'm not deeply familiar with the pcd format, so I
don't know how difficult this would be.  For example, many formats have a
field storing the number of points that would need to also be updated for
the file to be consistent.  Awk is likely powerful enough to handle this,
but it won't be a simple one line command.

However, like someone mentioned recently on this list, filtering the points
within pdal is probably the easiest and fastest option.  Example 2 in the
pdal translate documentation illustrates how to do this using
filters.range.  (Just leave out the bits about voxelcenters and smrf).

https://pdal.io/apps/translate.html#example-2

e.g.

pdal translate input.pcd output.csv range \
    --filters.range.limits="X![0:0]"

Message-ID: <94FD46EA13C22A4EAA5AF165F14E06760119D76343@QPS-MAIL2.QPS.local>

Hi all,

I'm working on reading and writing to my company's internal format. We don't remove points; we flag for exclusion. But I realized that culling filters "remove" points such that the writer won't see the removed points in the table view.

I'm interested in the set difference between the points that are read, and the points passed to the writer so they can be flagged for exclusion. Is there some API I'm missing or is this something my reader would have to take responsibility for in terms of passing metadata about the read set?

Your thoughts are appreciated,
Weston

Readers that want this usually create a dimension called something like
"PointId" and just set it to an incrementing value.  Note that points can
be created after the initial read.  Despite the name, filters can create
new points.  filters.poisson is notable in this regard as it discards the
entire input point set and replaces it with one of its own creation.

I am having build failures with PDAL on various Ubuntu 16.04 and Debian 9 machines that seems to have started sometime between 1.9 and 2.0.1.  It is looking for '/src/libgtest.so' (note the leading slash) which doesn't exist (there is no /src directory on my systems).  PDAL builds fine if I disable building tests.  I suspect something in cmake land is not right, but I am not sure where to look.  The '/src/libgtest.so' appears in many of the generated makefiles, but I don't see it set in CMakeCache.txt or see where it is calculated.

How old is the cmake? Can you install the latest cmake and check if you still have the issue?

Something like https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/blob/master/scripts/docker/ubuntu/dependencies/Dockerfile#L18 <https://github.com/PDAL/PDAL/blob/master/scripts/docker/ubuntu/dependencies/Dockerfile#L18> maybe will work on 16.04

2.0.1 builds fine, generally speaking, on 16.04, so there's something
special about your configuration.  You'd need to run the build command
(make, ninja, whatever) with enough detail so that we can look at the
output of the compilation.

Do you, perhaps, have a version of google test on your system that's
getting found instead of the one packaged with PDAL?  If you're using
gcc/clang, you can add "-MM" to the build options to get the header file
listing.

The \ isn't needed.  Use single quotes (or you need to escape the !)

pdal translate $file $(file%.pcd).csv range --filters.range.limits='X![0:0]'

It is not possible. You will need to use some other software or write your
own to calculate this.

Sorry for the delay.

I was using cmake 3.7.2 (default w/Debain 9I just build with cmake 3.15.3 and got the same results.  Looking at the Dockerfiles, I'm wondering if this might be a ninja vs make thing.

I just tested that ninja vs make doesn't matter.  Both try to use /src as the top level for building gtest.

I also tried building in a fresh VM.  I got the same errors when building as a normal user.  However, if I built as root, the build completed successfully (while leaving /src/libgtest_main.so and /src/libgtest.so behind on the filesystem).

I don't have a docker install handy, but is it possible the Dockerfiles build successfully because they run as root and are allowed to create /src?

Hi,I installed PDAL using the recommended method on this page: Quickstart — pdal.io and the started the "Print the first point" exercise.
I then received many .dll registry issues such as MSVP140D.dll and found that I needed to install Visual C++ 2015. I install Visual C++ 2015-2019 redistributable.However, I am still getting this issue when running pdal at all. I have tried multiple times to uninstall/reinstall Visual C++ 2015, but still get this issue. 

Environment:-Windows 10 Pro-Miniconda-Tried both using both python v3.6 and v3.7

I suspect the CMakeLists.txt of gtest is somehow not getting a proper CMake path set, and your hunch about it not mattering on the Docker builds due to them being built as root is probably accurate.

I would rummage around in the gtest CMake configuration and see if you can figure out which variable our CMake configuration needs to set.

This is not an issue with the pdal package or recipe but with conda at
large, I can reproduce it after updating a windows 10 env and it can be
triggered with other executables such as gdal.

By looking at their github issue tracker, it seems to happen quite
often unfortunatly.

Message-ID: <CAMPoL66aBzOyAY-+Wgdv_czNtgQSz_N53dXdqTrEKtm-A=cfDw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi !

Is it possible to use PDAL to increment the value of a certain column in a
.csv file at a certain interval? I have a csv file which has column called
'T'. I want to increment the value of T at a 200 interval. My first row
value will be 200,second will be 400, third will be 600 and it will go on.

Can anyone please guide me on this ?

Thanks

After multiple attempts at rummaging around, I think the culprit is in 'cmake/gtest.cmake'.  I suspect that ${gtest_BINARY_DIR} is unset.  Based on comments in 'vendor/gtest/CMakeLists.txt' it appears that it may also use this variable internally.

Interesting. We're definitely doing non-sudo builds on other platforms. I wonder how gtest_BINARY_DIR is getting properly set in those cases.

I'll just suggest again that there's something special about this
environment, because this is not an issue on other similar systems.

Message-ID: <CAMPoL66Q_ipC4rgzEs_F8DXkFF0-W=Ks1APVY-WncJv=MR0G0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is it possible to use the PDAL to change the column value in a pcd file? My
goal is to create a new column which will initiate with a value of 1000 and
increment by 200 for the rest of the column values.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

I found the difference.

The way to reproduce it is to call cmake with "-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DWITH_TESTS=ON".  Without BUILD_SHARED_LIBS, gtest only builds a '.a' file under the lib directory in the build directory which is fine.  With BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON, gtest also tries to build a .so in /src which fails due to permissions.

As PDAL builds shared libs by default anyway, the BUILD_SHARED_LIBS option isn't necessary and can just be dropped from my build script.

Thanks for the help and encouragement to sort this out.

Subject: [pdal] converting las to tif
Message-ID: <000801d56e1c$1e2357b0$5a6a0710$@googlemail.com>

Hi,
I want to use pdal to convert lidar data to tif. If I am using the following
pipline:
{
  	"pipeline":[
 	{
            	"type" : "readers.las",
            		"filename" : "linputfile.laz"
        },
  	{
      		"type":"filters.range",
      			"limits":",Classification[2:2]"
    	},
    	{ 
		"type": "writers.gdal",
      			"resolution": 1,
      			"radius": 1.5,
      			"filename":"outputfile.tif"
    	}
  		]
}
 I get a tif file, but the interpolation method is idw. So ever edge in the
surface will be fased and the peeks will also be cutted of.
If I am using the following pipeline:

{
  	"pipeline":[
 	{
            	"type" : "readers.las",
            		"filename" : "inputfile.laz"
        },
  	{
      		"type":"filters.range",
      			"limits":",Classification[2:2]"
    	},
	{
      		"type":"filters.delaunay"
    	},
 	    	{ 
	       "type": "writers.ply",
       		"filename": "output.ply",
        	"faces": true
    	}
  		]
}
 I  get a  very big textfile, witch I even cannot load into QGIS. Does
anyone have an advise?

Thanks


Jelto

We should force gtest to be built non-shared to avoid any issues.

We only do the interpolation methods described in the documentation:
https://pdal.io/stages/writers.gdal.html

You can write binary PLY.  Try:

   {
               "type": "writers.ply",
                "filename": "output.ply",
                "faces": true,
                 "storage_mode": "little_endian"
        }

You can also set the precision when writing text output.  See:
https://pdal.io/stages/writers.ply.html

Hello Jelto,

looks like you are trying to generate DTM from las file. Can you try the
method provided in this documentation.

https://pdal.io/workshop/exercises/analysis/dtm/dtm.html

Warm Regards,
Thejus
