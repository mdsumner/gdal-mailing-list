Subject: [pdal] entwine subsets
Message-ID: <CADm=QrSDTomUyXK4fU4RMPdTq7jOd6TGU62_2Mi_qELwX+sfFg@mail.gmail.com>

Please point me in the right direction if I missed this in the online docs.
If you use subsets, can they be built at the same time (e.g. one processor
working on subset 1 while another works on subset 2)? I somewhat assume
that's the point of subsets, but it looks like they write to the same
ept-data directory, so I wasn't sure if there was a potential conflict
there.
